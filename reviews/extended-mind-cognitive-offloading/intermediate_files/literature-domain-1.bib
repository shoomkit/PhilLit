====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The extended mind thesis (EMT), introduced by Clark and Chalmers in 1998, challenges traditional cognitive science by arguing that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include aspects of the physical and social environment. The thesis distinguishes itself from standard externalism about mental content by proposing active externalism - the view that external resources can play constitutive (not merely causal) roles in cognition when they are coupled with internal processes in the right way. The debate centers on the parity principle, which holds that if external processes perform the same functional role as internal processes, they should count as genuinely cognitive.

The literature divides into proponents who develop and defend various versions of EMT (Clark, Rowlands, Menary, Wilson) and critics who challenge the coupling-constitution inference and argue for principled boundaries to cognition (Adams and Aizawa, Rupert). Key theoretical issues include the distinction between vehicle and content externalism, the role of functionalist and externalist commitments, the proper individuation of cognitive systems, and whether EMT represents a genuine alternative to computational-representational theories or merely extends their scope.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the essential theoretical foundation for understanding how cognitive processes might extend into external resources. The debates about parity, coupling, and constitution directly inform questions about when external tools genuinely become part of cognitive processes versus merely supporting them. The functionalist framework underlying EMT connects to questions about what makes cognitive offloading genuinely cognitive rather than merely instrumental.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited coverage of the distinction between different motivations for EMT (phenomenological vs functional). Few papers addressing the relationship between EMT and empirical research on cognitive offloading. The role of learning and skill acquisition in establishing cognitive extension remains underexplored in this foundational literature. Six entries lack abstracts (Rupert 2004, Wilson 2005, Farkas 2011, Theiner 2011, Farina & Levin 2021, Farina & Lavazza 2022) - marked INCOMPLETE and excluded from synthesis but retained for reference completeness.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around the core theoretical commitments (parity principle, active externalism, functionalism), then map major positions (strong EMT, modest EMT, critics). Distinguish conceptual arguments from empirical considerations. Track how different authors understand the coupling-constitution inference and what constraints they place on cognitive extension.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong EMT (Clark, Rowlands): 8 papers - Cognitive processes routinely extend beyond the skull under ordinary conditions
- Modest EMT (Wilson, Menary): 3 papers - Some cognitive processes can extend in special circumstances
- Critics (Adams/Aizawa, Rupert, Farkas): 4 papers - Principled arguments against cognitive extension
- Meta-theoretical (Wheeler): 1 paper - Framework for understanding embodied-embedded cognition

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces active externalism and the parity principle, arguing that cognitive processes extend beyond the brain when external resources are coupled with internal processes in ways functionally equivalent to internal cognitive operations. Uses the Otto-Inga thought experiment to demonstrate how a notebook can constitute part of a belief system when it plays the same functional role as biological memory. Distinguishes active externalism (environment plays constitutive role in cognition) from content externalism (environment fixes semantic content).

  RELEVANCE: This is the founding paper for the extended mind debate and establishes the theoretical framework central to the entire research project. The parity principle and the coupling-constitution distinction are foundational concepts for understanding when and how cognitive offloading counts as genuine cognitive extension. The functionalist commitments underlying the argument directly inform questions about what makes external resources genuinely cognitive.

  POSITION: Foundational statement of strong extended mind thesis grounded in functionalist theory of mind.

Some accept the intuitive demarcations of skin and skull, and say that what is outside the body is outside the mind. Others are impressed by arguments suggesting that the meaning of our words "just ain't in the head", and hold that this externalism about meaning carries over into an externalism about mind. We propose to pursue a third position. We will advocate an externalism about mind, but one that is in no way grounded in the debatable role of external reference in fixing the contents of our mental states. Rather, we advocate an *active externalism*, based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and defends the extended mind thesis against major objections, introducing the notion of extended cognitive systems and arguing for complementarity between internal and external resources. Responds to Adams and Aizawa's coupling-constitution critique by refining the conditions for cognitive extension and emphasizing how brain, body, and world form integrated problem-solving wholes. Introduces the concept of cognitive niche construction and argues that human cognition is distinctively scaffolded by cultural and technological resources.

  RELEVANCE: This book-length treatment addresses the major theoretical challenges to EMT that emerged in the decade following the original paper. Clark's responses to critics and his development of complementarity and scaffolding concepts directly inform how we understand the mechanisms and conditions of cognitive extension in offloading scenarios. The emphasis on integration and coupling provides criteria for distinguishing genuine extension from mere tool use.

  abstract = {Abstract Studies of mind, thought, and reason have tended to marginalize the role of bodily form, real-world action, and environmental backdrop. In recent years, both in philosophy and cognitive science, this tendency has been identified and, increasingly, resisted. The result is a plethora of work on what has become known as embodied, situated, distributed, and even ‘extended’ cognition. Work in this new, loosely-knit field depicts thought and reason as in some way inextricably tied to the details of our gross bodily form, our habits of action and intervention, and the enabling web of social, cultural, and technological scaffolding in which we live, move, learn, and think. But exactly what kind of link is at issue? And what difference might such a link or links make to our best philosophical, psychological, and computational models of thought and reason? These are among the large unsolved problems in this increasingly popular field. This book offers both a tour of the emerging landscape, and an argument in favour of one approach to the key issues. That approach combines the use of representational, computational, and information-theoretic tools with an appreciation of the importance of context, timing, biomechanics, and dynamics. More controversially, it depicts some coalitions of biological and non-biological resources as the extended cognitive circuitry of individual minds.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the extended mind thesis by arguing that the parity principle conflates causal and constitutive relations. Develops the coupling-constitution fallacy: just because external resources are coupled with cognitive processes does not mean they constitute cognitive processes. Proposes the mark of the cognitive as non-derived content - cognitive processes involve intrinsic intentionality while external symbols have only derived intentionality. Argues that principled boundaries exist between cognition and its environmental supports.

  RELEVANCE: This paper articulates the central challenge to EMT and introduces the coupling-constitution distinction that subsequent debates must address. The question of whether cognitive offloading involves constitution or merely causation is fundamental to understanding what makes external resources genuinely cognitive versus merely instrumental.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops systems-based and empirical objections to extended cognition. Argues that cognitive systems should be individuated by causal-explanatory boundaries, not functional equivalence, and that empirical evidence from cognitive science supports brain-bound cognition. Challenges the parity principle by showing that internal and external processes differ systematically in portability, reliability, and accessibility. Proposes that extended cognition conflates personal and subpersonal levels of explanation.

  RELEVANCE: Rupert's systems-based critique provides an alternative framework for individuating cognitive systems that competes with the functionalist approach underlying EMT. His emphasis on empirical evidence and explanatory adequacy connects theoretical debates to actual cognitive scientific practice. The portability and reliability arguments bear directly on when external resources can function as genuine cognitive components in offloading scenarios.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes four forms of embodied cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended) and argues that extended cognition represents a genuine alternative to Cartesian cognitive science. Develops amalgamated mind thesis: cognitive processes are hybrids of internal neural processes and external environmental structures. Emphasizes the role of action and manipulation in constituting cognitive processes, drawing on phenomenological insights about intentionality and world-directedness.

  RELEVANCE: Rowlands provides a systematic taxonomy of embodied-embedded approaches and situates extended mind within this broader framework. His amalgamated mind concept offers a middle path between strong externalism and internalism, relevant for understanding cognitive offloading as involving hybrid processes. The phenomenological dimension adds considerations about experience and intentionality to the functional arguments.

There is a new way of thinking about the mind that does not locate mental processes exclusively "in the head." Some think that this expanded conception of the mind will be the basis of a new science of the mind. In this book, leading philosopher Mark Rowlands investigates the conceptual foundations of this new science of the mind. The new way of thinking about the mind emphasizes the ways in which mental processes are embodied (made up partly of extraneural bodily structures and processes), embedded (designed to function in tandem with the environment), enacted (constituted in part by action), and extended (located in the environment). The new way of thinking about the mind, Rowlands writes, is actually an old way of thinking that has taken on new form. Rowlands describes a conception of mind that had its clearest expression in phenomenology—in the work of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. He builds on these views, clarifies and renders consistent the ideas of embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended mind, and develops a unified philosophical treatment of the novel conception of the mind that underlies the new science of the mind.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a Heideggerian approach to extended and embedded cognition, arguing that cognitive science must account for skilled coping and equipment-involving practices. Distinguishes different strengths of extended cognition thesis and argues that understanding-driven cognition (online intelligence) extends more readily than knowledge-driven cognition. Emphasizes the role of embodiment and environmental structure in enabling cognitive success without requiring explicit representation.

  RELEVANCE: Wheeler's framework provides conceptual tools for understanding different forms and degrees of cognitive extension, directly relevant to distinguishing when offloading involves genuine extension. His distinction between online and offline cognition suggests that not all cognitive processes extend equally, informing questions about which types of cognitive tasks are amenable to extension through external resources.

  abstract = {In Reconstructing the Cognitive World, Michael Wheeler argues that we should turn away from the generically Cartesian philosophical foundations of much contemporary cognitive science research and proposes instead a Heideggerian approach. Wheeler begins with an interpretation of Descartes. He defines Cartesian psychology as a conceptual framework of explanatory principles and shows how each of these principles is part of the deep assumptions of orthodox cognitive science (both classical and connectionist). Wheeler then turns to Heidegger's radically non-Cartesian account of everyday cognition, which, he argues, can be used to articulate the philosophical foundations of a genuinely non-Cartesian cognitive science. Finding that Heidegger's critique of Cartesian thinking falls short, even when supported by Hubert Dreyfus's influential critique of orthodox artificial intelligence, Wheeler suggests a new Heideggerian approach. He points to recent research in "embodied-embedded" cognitive science and proposes a Heideggerian framework to identify, amplify, and clarify the underlying philosophical foundations of this new work. He focuses much of his investigation on recent work in artificial intelligence-oriented robotics, discussing, among other topics, the nature and status of representational explanation, and whether (and to what extent) cognition is computation rather than a noncomputational phenomenon best described in the language of dynamical systems theory. Wheeler's argument draws on analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and empirical work to "reconstruct" the philosophical foundations of cognitive science in a time of a fundamental shift away from a generically Cartesian approach. His analysis demonstrates that Heideggerian continental philosophy and naturalistic cognitive science need not be mutually exclusive and shows further that a Heideggerian framework can act as the "conceptual glue" for new work in cognitive science.

Develops the concept of socially extended minds where cognitive extension occurs through interpersonal interaction and social scaffolding. Argues that extended mind provides resources for understanding group-level cognition without reducing it to individual psychology.

  RELEVANCE: Wilson's extension of EMT to collective cognition raises questions about whether cognitive offloading can occur at social and institutional levels, not just individual-environment coupling. This connects to questions about how shared external resources (institutional memory, collaborative tools) might constitute collective cognitive processes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys the extended mind debate and introduces cognitive integration as an alternative framework. Distinguishes extended mind from embedded mind and argues that the key issue is integration rather than mere coupling. Proposes that cognitive processes extend when internal and external resources are integrated through learned skilled activity. Emphasizes the role of enculturation and the development of cognitive practices in enabling extension.

  RELEVANCE: Menary's cognitive integration framework provides criteria for when coupling amounts to genuine cognitive extension, directly relevant to understanding when offloading creates extended cognitive systems. The emphasis on learning and skill acquisition suggests that cognitive extension is not automatic but requires development of appropriate practices.

Provoking much debate about the subject, the essay’s main theories are presented in the following chapters, together with their criticisms and developments. Clark and Chalmers propose an “active externalism” that is to be differentiated from traditional externalism; it is concerned with the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes. The active nature of this externalism is explained in terms of the notion of causal coupling, which states that the human organism is reciprocally linked with an external entity.

The question of whether cognitive offloading involves extension of cognitive vehicles or merely reliance on externally determined contents bears directly on the nature of extension.

  RELEVANCE: This application of EMT to ethics raises questions about the normative significance of cognitive extension through offloading.

Further, I argue that the thesis alters the focus of neuroethics, away from the question of whether we ought to allow interventions into the mind, and toward the question of which interventions we ought to allow and under what conditions. The extended mind thesis dramatically expands the scope of neuroethics: because interventions into the environment of agents can count as interventions into their minds, decisions concerning such interventions become questions for neuroethics.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Criticizes EMT for preserving an inside-outside dualism by treating mind as an inner core that extends into external artifacts. Proposes an artifactual mind concept drawing on Peirce: mind unfolds through artifacts rather than extending from a biological core. Argues that technical artifacts shape cognitive possibilities rather than merely serving pre-established cognitive goals. Mind is technologically constituted, not merely extended.

  RELEVANCE: This critique raises questions about whether EMT truly overcomes traditional boundaries or merely relocates them. The artifactual mind concept suggests that cognitive offloading may not be extension of inner processes but rather transformation of cognitive capacities through technological mediation. This alternative framework may better capture how tools reshape what cognition is rather than merely where it occurs.

According to the author, this is because a pivotal distinction between inside and outside is preserved in the Extended Mind theorist’s account of the relation between the human organism and the world of external objects and artifacts, a distinction which they proclaim to have overcome. Inspired by Charles S. Peirce’s philosophy of mind, in particular, the author tries to find a way out of this ‘inside–outside’ fallacy. External objects, artifacts or processes should, according to him, not be conceived as inanimate and unintelligent matter utilised by a separately living, inner mental sphere that has set certain pre-established goals for itself. Mind has rather an artifactual character. It is not extended by an inner biological cognitive core but rather unfolds itself through objects and artifacts. Mind as such is, especially in our modern technological culture, shaped by virtue of and through technical artifacts. Recognizing this artifactual dimension of mind will, the author concludes, enable a more critical analysis of contemporary claims that ascribe certain original and irreducible features to thinking.},

  RELEVANCE: This application to psychiatry demonstrates how stakes of the extended mind debate connect to practical questions about cognitive functioning.

  abstract = {The thesis that mental states extend beyond the skull, otherwise known as the extended mind thesis (ExM), has attracted considerable philosophical attention and support. It has also been accused of lacking practical import. At the same time, the field of psychiatry has remained largely unacquainted with ExM, tending to rely instead upon what ExM proponents would consider to be outdated models of the mind. ExM and psychiatry, therefore, have much to offer one another, but the connection between the two has remained largely unexplored. Here, I consider what implications ExM may have for psychiatry and, in so doing, reveal how psychiatry may lend practical import to ExM. First, I detail the possibility of the extension of one mental state relevant to psychiatry. I augment this example by surveying other possibilities for extension in the context of psychiatric diagnoses. I then consider ways in which such extensions might alter psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Overall, I argue that recognition of the truth of ExM could alter the diagnostic status of certain individuals by correcting both false positives and false negatives, re-conceptualize certain aspects of treatment, help us re-envision psychiatric research, and potentially increase empathy towards those individuals considered to be mentally disordered or mentally different.},

Such claims go far beyond the important, but less challenging, assertion that human cognizing leans heavily on various forms of external scaffolding and support. Instead, they paint mind itself (or better, the physical machinery that realizes some of our cognitive processes and mental states) as, under humanly attainable conditions, extending beyond the bounds of skin and skull. Extended cognition in its most general form occurs when internal and external resources become fluently tuned and deeply integrated in such a way as to enable a cognitive agent to solve problems and accomplish their projects, goals, and interests. Consider, for instance, how technological resources such as pens, paper, and personal computers are now so deeply integrated into our everyday lives that we couldn’t accomplish many of our cognitive goals and purposes without them. The extended mind thesis claims that technological resources have become so thoroughly enmeshed with our internal cognitive machinery that they now count as part of the machinery of thought itself. Underlying (but distinct from) the extended mind thesis is a commonplace observation thatintelligent problem solving of the kind we find in adult humans isn’t something the naked brain can achieve all on its own, but is instead the outcome of the brain and body operating together in an environmental and often technologically loaded setting. As humans, we possess the kinds of high-level cognitive skills and abilities we do in no small part because of the many tools we use for thinking. The extended mind thesis goes further, however, by claiming that it is mere prejudice to suppose that all cognition must take place within the confines of the organism’s skin and skull. Cognitive science, it is then claimed, shouldn’t only concern itself with the more or less enduring processes taking place inside the heads of cognitive agents. Cognitive scientists should also investigate, on a kind of equal footing, temporary, soft-assembled wholes that mesh the problem-solving contributions of the brain and nervous system with the body and physical and sociocultural environment.},

  title = {Res Cogitans Extensa: A Philosophical Defense of the Extended Mind Thesis},
  year = {2011},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides book-length philosophical defense of extended mind against major objections, developing the parity principle and arguing for extended reasoning. Addresses the coupling-constitution challenge and defends the functional identity of internal and external cognitive processes. Examines language and writing as technologies of mind that enable new forms of cognitive processing. Develops the view that humans are hybrid creatures whose cognitive capacities are essentially technology-involving.

  RELEVANCE: This systematic defense addresses the major philosophical challenges to EMT and develops the positive case for cognitive extension. The focus on language and writing as cognitive technologies directly connects to questions about how symbolic external resources enable cognitive offloading. The hybrid creatures concept suggests that extended cognition may be normal rather than exceptional for human cognition.

  POSITION: Systematic philosophical defense of strong extended mind thesis.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys applications of extended mind thesis across multiple domains including education, technology design, and cognitive enhancement. Argues that EMT has practical implications for understanding how we design cognitive tools and environments. Examines how extended mind framework can inform human-computer interaction and interface design. Discusses relationship between EMT and transhumanist questions about cognitive enhancement through technology.

  RELEVANCE: This examination of applications demonstrates how extended mind debates connect to practical questions about designing for cognitive offloading. If minds genuinely extend into artifacts, then tool design becomes cognitive system design. The discussion of enhancement connects to questions about whether offloading improves or merely redistributes cognitive work.

  POSITION: Application-oriented development of EMT focusing on technology and enhancement.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines extended mind thesis in light of transhumanist and posthumanist perspectives on human-technology integration. Argues that EMT provides philosophical foundation for understanding radical cognitive enhancement through neural implants and brain-computer interfaces. Distinguishes between embedded minds (minds in scaffolding environments) and extended minds (minds that incorporate external resources as proper parts). Discusses implications for personal identity and agency in scenarios of deep human-technology merger.

  RELEVANCE: This discussion of radical enhancement scenarios pushes the extended mind framework to its limits and raises questions about degrees and mechanisms of cognitive extension. The distinction between embedding and extension bears on whether cognitive offloading involves weak (environmental support) or strong (constitutional incorporation) forms of cognitive augmentation. Recent work connecting to contemporary technology.

  POSITION: Extension of EMT to transhumanist and posthumanist contexts.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses a tension between body-centric embodied cognition and extended functionalism, asking what is special about the body if minds can extend into artifacts. Argues that the body plays a distinctive role in cognition while still allowing for genuine cognitive extension. Develops the concept of the body as a special kind of cognitive resource that enables both embodied and extended cognition. Distinguishes between wholesale externalism and more nuanced views about body-environment-brain integration.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses whether extended mind undermines the significance of embodiment or whether the two perspectives can be reconciled. The question bears on whether cognitive offloading to external resources has the same cognitive status as bodily skills and sensorimotor integration. Clark's reconciliation attempt suggests that different forms of extension may have different cognitive significance.

  POSITION: Reconciliation of embodied and extended cognition emphasizing body's special role.

  abstract = {Mind, it is increasingly fashionable to assert, is an intrinsically embodied and environmentally embedded phenomenon. But there is a potential tension between two strands of thought prominent in this recent literature. One of those strands depicts the body as special, and the fine details of a creature’s embodiment as a major constraint on the nature of its mind: a kind of new‐wave body‐centrism. The other depicts the body as just one element in a kind of equal‐partners dance between brain, body and world, with the nature of the mind fixed by the overall balance thus achieved: a kind of extended functionalism (now with an even broader canvas for multiple realizability than ever before). The present paper displays the tension, scouts the space of possible responses, and ends by attempting to specify what the body actually needs to be, given its complex role in these recent debates.},
