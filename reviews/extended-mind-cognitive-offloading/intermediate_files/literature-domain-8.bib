DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers fundamental objections to extended cognition, alternative
theoretical frameworks, and methodological limitations of offloading research.
The critique landscape divides into three main strands. First, internalist
objections from Adams, Aizawa, and Rupert challenge the conceptual coherence
of extended cognition, arguing that coupling between brain and environment does
not constitute cognitive extension (the "coupling-constitution fallacy") and
that there exists a "mark of the cognitive" restricting cognition to intrinsic
neural properties. Second, alternative 4E frameworks—particularly radical
enactivism and predictive processing—offer competing accounts that either reject
representational content entirely (Hutto & Myin) or locate cognitive boundaries
differently (Hohwy's internalist predictive processing). Third, methodological
critiques examine problems with empirical extended mind research: unclear
individuation criteria for cognitive systems, arbitrary stopping conditions for
what counts as "part of" cognition, and difficulties translating philosophical
theses into testable predictions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These critiques reveal fault lines in both philosophical foundations and
empirical operationalizations of extended cognition and offloading. The
internalist challenges directly target the conceptual machinery undergirding
offloading research (if coupling ≠ constitution, what does "offloading"
mean?). Alternative frameworks suggest extended mind may obscure more
fundamental issues about embodiment, action-perception loops, or prediction
error minimization. Methodological concerns about individuating extended
systems directly impact how offloading studies design experiments and
interpret results.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited coverage of recent (2020-2025) empirical challenges to extended
cognition research. Predictive processing literature is extensive but its
implications for extended mind debates remain underdeveloped in this search.
Three entries marked INCOMPLETE (no abstract available): Sprevak 2009
(functionalist critique), Di Paolo 2008 (enactivist alternative), Rupert 2021
(predictive processing and systems). These papers remain in bibliography but
synthesis agents should rely on notes rather than abstracts.
SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around three critique types (conceptual/internalist, alternative
frameworks, methodological). For each, distinguish what's at stake: whether
extended mind is false, whether it's uninteresting, or whether it's
empirically untestable. Track how defenders respond—e.g., Clark's replies
to Adams & Aizawa evolve from 2005 to 2010.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces the "coupling-constitution fallacy"—the error of
  inferring that because a brain is coupled to external resources, those
  resources constitute part of the cognitive system. Proposes a "mark of the
  cognitive" based on non-derived content (intrinsic intentionality) that
  restricts cognition to neural processes. Argues that Otto's notebook is
  causally coupled to his cognition but not constitutive of it, just as a
  hearing aid is coupled to perception without being part of the perceptual
  system.

  RELEVANCE: Seminal internalist critique that frames subsequent debate.
  Directly challenges the conceptual foundations of extended cognition by
  questioning the inference from functional equivalence (parity) to cognitive
  extension (constitution). Raises the question of what makes cognitive
  offloading genuinely cognitive versus merely instrumental tool use—central
  to interpreting offloading research.

  POSITION: Internalist critique defending "contingent intracranialism"—the
  view that cognition could extend beyond the brain but empirically does not
  in actual human cases.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends 2001 critique by responding to objections. Defends
  the mark of the cognitive (non-derived content) against charges of
  circularity and argues that parity-based arguments fail because functional
  similarity does not entail common constitutive base. Distinguishes cognitive
  processes (intrinsically contentful) from cognitive effects (mere causal
  consequences of cognitive processes). External resources produce cognitive
  effects but lack the intrinsic properties required for cognition proper.

  RELEVANCE: Represents mature version of internalist position after extended
  debate with Clark and others. Shows how internalist critique shifts from
  attacking parity principle to attacking constitution claims directly. Raises
  issue of whether offloading research studies cognitive extension or merely
  causal scaffolding for cognition—methodologically crucial distinction.

  POSITION: Refined internalist defense maintaining that coupling relations
  are insufficiently robust to ground constitution claims about cognitive
  systems.

Clark's hypothesis assumes that the nature of the processes internal to an object has nothing to do with whether that object carries out cognitive processing. The only condition required is that the object is coupled with a cognitive agent and interacts with it in a certain way. In making this tenuous connection, Clark commits the most common mistake extended mind theorists make; alleging that an object becomes cognitive once it is connected to a cognitive agent is a "coupling-constitution fallacy." From this fallacy, many hastily proceed to the conclusion that the object or process constitutes part of the agent's cognitive apparatus or cognitive processing.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Adams & Aizawa's mark of the cognitive by
  arguing that the distinction between derived and non-derived content does
  not map neatly onto brain-world boundary. Notes that much neural content
  is arguably derived (from evolutionary history, learning, calibration) and
  that demanding non-derived content would exclude paradigm cases of cognition.
  Defends parity-based arguments by emphasizing functional role rather than
  intrinsic properties as the proper basis for cognitive taxonomy.

  RELEVANCE: Key extended mind response to internalist critique. Shows debate
  turns on what grounds cognitive taxonomy—intrinsic properties versus
  functional roles. For offloading research, suggests that focus should be on
  what external resources do (functional contribution) rather than what they
  are made of (substrate). But leaves open how to individuate "same function"
  across internal and external cases.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that standard functionalist individuation of mental
  states undermines extended cognition rather than supporting it. Shows that
  functionalism individuates mental states by narrow computational role
  (input-output profile relative to other internal states), which typically
  excludes external resources. Even if Otto's notebook plays a functional role
  in his behavior, it does not play the narrow computational role that
  individuates belief states on functionalist taxonomy. Extended cognition
  requires either revising functionalism or abandoning it.

  RELEVANCE: Sophisticated internalist argument showing tension between
  extended mind and its typical functionalist motivation. Creates dilemma for
  extended cognition: either adopt functionalism and lose extension, or keep
  extension but give up functionalist credentials. For offloading research,
  raises question of what theoretical framework supports attributing cognitive
  properties to brain-environment systems if not functionalism.

  POSITION: Functionalist critique arguing extended cognition is incompatible
  with standard functionalist individuation of cognitive states.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Sprevak by defending "extended functionalism"—a
  version of functionalism that individuates cognitive states by wide
  computational roles that can span brain-body-environment. Argues that
  functionalism's core commitment is to multiple realizability and functional
  organization, not to narrow intracranial individuation. Cognitive systems
  are whatever systems realize the right functional organization, and this
  can include hybrid systems.

  RELEVANCE: Key extended mind defense against functionalist critiques. Shows
  that functionalism is neutral on location of cognitive states—could support
  either internalism or externalism depending on how functional roles are
  individuated. Suggests offloading research presupposes wide functionalism:
  external resources count as cognitive when they play appropriate functional
  roles in agent's overall cognitive economy.

ExC claims that there are conditions under which thinking and thoughts are spatially distributed over the brain, body, and world in such a way that the external factors concerned are rightly accorded cognitive status. It is concerned mainly with the whereabouts of thinking and thoughts that is separate not only from the position adopted by orthodox cognitive science, but also from the position adopted by any embodied-embedded account of mind. Adams and Aizawa have repeatedly emphasized the insufficiency of thoughts being spatially distributed over brain, body, and world solely in the sense that applies when some instance of intelligent behavior is discovered to be causally dependent on the bodily exploitation of certain external props. The chapter concludes with a brief remark on extended functionalism and phenomenal consciousness.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends the "Hypothesis of Embedded Cognition" (HEC) against
  the "Hypothesis of Extended Cognition" (HEC). Argues that cognitive systems
  are properly individuated at the level of integrated causal systems with
  persisting organizational unity, which in humans means brain-based systems
  embedded in rich environmental scaffolding. External resources are part of
  the cognitive agent's environmental niche but not part of the cognitive
  system itself. Offers detailed empirical arguments from cognitive science
  that internal and external resources differ in processing characteristics.

  RELEVANCE: Most systematic book-length internalist critique. Provides
  detailed framework for distinguishing embedded cognition (uncontroversial)
  from extended cognition (controversial). For offloading research, suggests
  that apparent "extension" is better understood as sophisticated embedding—
  internal systems exploit external resources without incorporating them.
  Raises methodological issue of how to empirically distinguish embedding from
  extension.

  cognition, grounded in empirical cognitive science rather than conceptual
  analysis alone.

  abstract = {Once upon a time,  empirically-informed, philosophical work on the mind was pretty straightforward. Mental  activity went on inside the head, and we were pretty sure that it, along with all the  good stuff associated with it — consciousness, intentionality, mental representation, computation — could be most readily understood without  having to crease our brows too much about how minds were situated vis-à-vis  bodies, or vis-à-vis environments.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

To be sure, the cognitive  sciences had renegade, pluralistic strands running through them, and particular  disciplinary itches that needed scratching. But there was a sufficiently articulated paradigm in place that at least made designing jacket covers for books  in the field relatively easy. Find a picture of a head, such as a  representation of a brain, ideally an image a bit attuned to the title or theme of the book,  and you’re at least well on your way. I failed to understand this simple  point during what were politely called “ongoing discussions” over the cover ofTheMITEncyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciencesa dozen years ago. “No, I’m sorry, Professor Wilson”, I was informed by way of a solemn conclusion delivered by an exasperated  senior editor at the Press, someone whom I imagined had to avert his gaze in embarrassment on my behalf as he typed back curtly, “I am afraid that it has to be a head”.

Designing jacket covers for  books in this neck of the woods is no longer so easy. Heads are not exactly out,  but they are no longer strictly required. Shaun Gallagher and DanZahavi’sThe Phenomenological Mind(2008) has a person half-way through exit mode  on its cover. Fred Adams and KenAizawa’sThe Bounds of Cognition(2008), for crying out loud, hasa cube of green cubes on the cover. Not evena thing that thinks, so far as we know. Rob Rupert’s stimulating book  continues down this path with quite a beautiful black and white photograph of a  grove of aspens in the wilds of Colorado plonked right on the cover. It’s enough  to start me worrying that in order to understand the field that I work in, I  can no longer simply look at jacket covers.

In order to write this review  in my current state of existential confusion, I have thus had to resort to an  old trick of the trade, something I learned in grad school but like most  things so learnt, haven’t had to use much since. Read. And, somewhat to my initial surprise, especially given the total absence of pictures once one gets  beyond the cover ofCognitive Systems and the Extended Mind, and the distinct dearth of bad jokes between the  sheets, I’m glad I did. Rupert’s book is a good read. It is a sustained, systematic, critical examination of the idea that minds are not simply ensconced  inside heads, but extend into both bodies and the world beyond the body. As his  title suggests, Rupert is focused primarily on the latter of these, the  extended mind thesis, a thesis articulated neatly by Andy Clark and David Chalmers a  dozen years ago in a paper that, had it been a movie, would have been an  instant blockbuster, then a classic, and now be competing with Seinfeld re-runs  on cabletv.

Cognitive Systems and the Extended Minddraws on a  series of papers published over the past ten years that have been influential, but  it is much more than the sum of these past parts. Bookended by introductory  and concluding chapters, its ten chapters fall into three constituent parts.  In Part I, Rupert defends the idea that “the relatively durable cognitive system … provides the most plausible line of demarcation between  what is cognitive and what is not” (p.7), using this idea to make a prima facie case for the claim that cognition is at least organism-bound. Part II concentrates on arguments for the hypothesis of extended cognition  (HEC), and why they fail, with Rupert helping himself to his conclusions from Part  I. Finally, PartIIImoves back from the rejection ofHECto focus on two other ways  to understand the sense in which cognition requires some kind of situated approach, what Rupert calls theembedded view, and the idea that cognition isembodied. I will concentrate on Part I in what follows, say something more briefly  about Part II, and leave PartIIIalone altogether. The bottom line for  Rupert: there is no reason to accept the idea of extended cognition, many perfectly  sane reasons to reject it, and the take-home lessons from considering the  seemingly less radical ideas that cognition is embedded and embodied are that what insights they contain are readily accommodated by cognitive science, traditionally conceived. Paradigm found.

There is much to admire in  this book. It is well-structured and well-written, adopting a self-consciously  naturalistic perspective on how to understand the mind — through our best, even if imperfect, empirical sciences in the domain of cognition. By presenting  and critiquing a number of explicit arguments for and against the specific  views that Rupert considers,Cognitive Systemsadvances the field. For all that, I think that the claims at the heart  of the book — those about cognitive systems that drive the positive argument  of Part I, and those that appeal to natural kinds (ch.5), developmental systems  (ch.6), dynamical systems (ch.7), and experience (ch.8) in an attempt to  undermine arguments forHECin the negative argument of Part II — are mistaken.  Or, rather, insofar as they are true, they do little to capitalize on the  head start advantage that head-bound views of cognition have in virtue of the individualism pervasive in cognitive science’s history.

Consider Rupert’s chief pair  of arguments in Part I. The first of these appeals to an idea central to a  number of critiques ofHEC, especially those developed by Adams andAizawaover the past ten years: that there must be  a principled way to distinguish “genuinely cognitive contributions” from “merely causal” contributions to cognitive processes (p.16). The idea, in one version, is this. Everyone acknowledges that lots of  things, including lots of things outside the head,causecognitive processes. Books, faraway rocks, and the word “Rosebud” can all cause cognitive processes, in fact, can cause certain cognitive  processes, rather than others. But not all that many thingsconstitutecognitive processes. And certainly not everything that causes cognitive processes constitutes cognitive processes. Indeed, one  might even think that being such a causeprecludes being such a constituent, causes being, after all, distinct from  what they cause. (Following this thought suggests, to me at least, a deep  confusion in the kind of juxtaposition of cause and constituent in play that I will  not pursue here.) Thus, we need aprinciple of demarcationthat delineates mere causes from genuine constituents  of cognition.

There are two short but basic  questions to pose here. First: why? Second, one that I have picked up at  occasional postmodernistseances: who are “we”? Take them in reverse order. Precisely who needs this kind of principle of demarcation? Surely not practicing cognitive scientists, in part because  they seem to have gotten along perfectly well without one until now.  Philosophers? Well, not philosophers who take one of the chief lessons of the failure of  logical positivism in the philosophy of science, the collapse of the  analytic-synthetic distinction alongQuineanlines in the same,  and the limitations of conceptual analysis to be a deep suspicion of the search  for such principles.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Offers enactivist critique of extended mind from the left—
  argues extended mind doesn't go far enough in breaking with cognitivist
  assumptions. Proposes "extended life" framework grounded in autopoietic
  enactivism: cognitive processes are sense-making activities of autonomous
  living systems, which are constitutively open to their environment. Extended
  mind preserves problematic internalist assumptions (representation, cognitive
  content) while merely relocating them. True alternative requires recognizing
  mind as life process, not computational process.

  RELEVANCE: Enactivist alternative that rejects both internalism and extended
  mind as insufficiently radical. For offloading research, suggests current
  framework may misidentify the phenomenon—not extension of cognitive states
  but transformation of sense-making activities through environmental coupling.
  Points toward different empirical questions: how does environmental structure

  isbn = {978-0262018548},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "radical enactivism" (REC)—the view that basic
  cognition involves no content or representation whatsoever. Argues that
  extended mind debate presupposes contentful mental states and merely argues
  about their location, leaving fundamental problems about content
  naturalization unaddressed. Basic minds (perception, action, simple learning)
  operate through direct engagement with affordances and sensorimotor
  contingencies without representational content. Content emerges only through
  sociocultural practices like language.

  RELEVANCE: Most radical alternative to extended mind debate—rejects the
  representational framework underlying both sides. For offloading research,
  suggests many phenomena labeled "cognitive offloading" may not involve
  offloading representational content at all, but rather reconfiguring
  sensorimotor engagements. Raises question whether offloading metaphor itself
  presupposes discredited representationalist assumptions about cognition.

  abstract = {In this short but provocative book, the authors defend a radically enactivist philosophy of mind, upon which all but the most linguistically sophisticated cognitive and perceptual processes are free from representational content. The target of Hutto and Myin's critique is thus not only the standard opponent of the enactivist tradition -- namely, accounts of the mind that treat it in classical intentionalist or information-processing terms -- but also more moderate forms of enactivism itself, plus its close cousins the embodied, embedded, and extended theories of mind. Proponents of the latter views, although their themes and concerns are broadly consonant with radical enactivism in challenging neurocentricism and emphasising the active and world-engaging nature of cognition and perception, are deemed to remain in the grip of an unsustainable background commitment to representationalist thinking. A truly thoroughgoing anti-representationalism, the authors believe, is the logical outcome of the enactivist programme, and it is the role of the book to lay out the groundwork for such a project.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Much of the volume is devoted to delivering a sequence of arguments which aim to force the fan of content to retreat to an ever-narrower conception of when and where representational states are required, with a view to showing that only those creatures with substantial conceptual powers, scaffolded by public language, need be described in content-involving terms. The core proposal is the so-called Hard Problem of Content (chapter 4): the challenge of accommodating the essential features of intentional states -- their truth, reference, accuracy and logical properties -- in naturalistic terms. Reflective scrutiny reveals, the authors argue, that the notion of content as causally efficacious, and hence as serving to explain an individual's intelligent behaviour, is unfounded. Hutto and Myin examine familiar existing naturalistic theories of content, and find them unable to answer the Hard Problem. Models of content that appeal to patterns of reliable causal covariation holding between external states of affairs and components of internal processing systems (e.g., Dretske, 1981), and which rely upon a robust conception of information, are found to be unsuccessful in virtue of failing to explain the relevant truth-bearing properties. A relation of correspondence or indication, however reliable, explains nothing more than the conditions under which an internal state will be tokened; it reveals nothing about what the state "says" or "means".

Underpinning this criticism is the authors' scepticism about the explanatory usefulness of the traditional conception of informational content; naturally occurring meaning that can be transmitted and communicated, picked up and passed on, by biological organisms. The content enthusiast is, Hutto and Myin believe, forced into a dilemma here: either accept that information is nothing but causal covariance, in which case it is not a type of content proper; or hold that content is an irreducible, albeit natural, property of some physical systems (on the model of Chalmers' (2010) non-reductive analysis of qualia). A surprising omission from the chapter on naturalised theories of content is Fodor's (1987) asymmetric dependency thesis, which escapes the authors' critical attention. Perhaps they view it as susceptible to the objections that they take to face causal-covariation accounts, but more work would need to be done to demonstrate that Fodor's additional conditions -- which are after all in place in order to distance his position from simpler alternatives -- provide no way to respond to these challenges.

Teleosemantic theories of content do come under the spotlight, and are judged to fare equally poorly in meeting the demands of the Hard Problem (p71). Accounts of this sort (e.g., Dretske, 1995; Millikan, 1984, 1993) understand the content of an intentional state to be determined by two factors: firstly by the information transmitted by a signal that is received by a system, and with which the state in question covaries, and secondly by the consumers of the state, and their proper functions. States of a creature's visual system, for example, are said to represent features of the world in virtue of these states' consumers having the proper function of responding to signals that indicate those features. As Hutto and Myin point out, teleofunctional theories can accord varying weight to each of the two factors in giving an account of intentional content -- the relevant burden may be shouldered by covariance; by consumption; or by some combination of the two. If they are correct that mere covariation or indication cannot suffice for genuine content, they continue, then the prospects for a teleofunctionalism that relies heavily on the first factor are slim: there are no pre-existing natural meanings out in the world, ready to be consumed. On the other hand, a consumer-emphasising semantics struggles with the perennial problem of accounting for the intensional nature of contentful states: "biology lacks the resources for specifying under which guise such states might represent what they target" (p79).

In a more novel strategem, Hutto and Myin note that a pure consumer-semantic theory (what they call the Strengthened Millikan Maneuver (p75) upon which content is generated solely through the consumption of states, and does not pre-exist this consumption) is, in spirit if not in detail, closely akin to the core tenets of enactivism itself. Where the former speaks of content-creating systems within an organism, the latter talks of the organism's bringing forth meaning and value on the basis of its autonomy. On both programmes, the most basic forms of directedness are biological dealings, respondings, and strivings, all of which -- on Hutto and Myin's view -- can be understood as 'meaningful' for the organism without strict representationalist talk of reference, truth, or accuracy.

Hutto and Myin's anti-representationalist challenges aim to undermine not only these traditional neurocentric approaches to naturalising content, but also more recent embodied-embedded theories of cognition and perception whose explanatory resources include minimal, bodily or action-oriented representations. Sensorimotor theories of perception (e.g., Noë, 2004), upon which experience is said to be mediated by an implicit knowledge of the sensory consequences of skilful, exploratory movement, are said to over-intellectualise a creature's perceptual engagement with her environment by treating this implicit understanding as conceptual in nature. Radical enactivism, in contrast, considers perception to be non-predicative -- experiences do not attribute properties to objects -- and unmediated by stored representational content.

The negative, critical element of Hutto and Myin's discussion is largely compelling, and weighs against an unreflective acceptance of intentionalist thinking about the mind. Less satisfying, however, is the level of detail they offer concerning radical enactivism's alternative to representationalist explanations of mentality. One area where readers may reasonably expect a further degree of analysis is that of the structure of perceptual experience. The claim that perceptual states are non-predicative -- that they do not attribute properties such as shape, size, and colour to objects -- is counter-intuitive, and the authors offer little in the way of a replacement account of the phenomenology of how thingsdoappear in experience. We are told that perceivers are "aspectual respondents" (p121): things can look or feel a certain way to an individual, without their representing anything as being thus and so. Radical enactivism treats experience as a direct engagement with the physical world; it aims to align itself with the sensorimotor approach whilst jettisoning its talk of implicit understanding or representational mediation. But this is to neglect the explanatory work that is performed by such knowledge on the sensorimotor model, namely in providing an understanding of the conscious subject's access to perceptual constancies: the ability to keep track, in perception, of the invariant features of objects in addition to their appearances (looks, feels, sounds). Sensorimotor theories show how aspectual respondents can come to perceive these unchanging properties amid the evolving patterns of motor-induced sensory stimulation. Without this representational component, it appears to be a consequence of radical enactivism that only linguistically expert agents are capable of seeing the observer-independent properties of objects (their shapes, spatial distribution, size, and so forth) at all, and this is a difficult bullet to bite.

From the non-predicative account of perception, with its rejection of associated correctness conditions, it follows that the distinction between veridical and illusory experience is hard for the radical enactivist to draw. Hutto and Myin believe that the standard intentionalist account of misperception as misrepresentation is unsuccessful because it depends upon ascribing to experience an unsustainable kind of content, a content that is both propositional and introspectively accessible, and is reliant upon high-level interpretative capacities being in play (pp124-5). Not only are creatures with basic minds, who are without fully-formed conceptual abilities, thus unable to undergo perceptual illusions, it is difficult to see how to resist this conclusion even for adult human perceivers once perception is understood to be content-free across the board.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends extended mind against Adams & Aizawa's two main
  criticisms by arguing (1) their proposed mark of the cognitive (non-derived
  content) fails to secure intracranialism because neural content is often
  derived, and (2) the coupling-constitution fallacy charge misunderstands
  extended cognition's methodological commitments. Extended cognition argues
  that coupling relations are the right way to individuate cognitive systems
  given a minimal functional mark of the cognitive, not that all coupling
  constitutes cognition.

  RELEVANCE: Recent synthesis of extended mind responses to internalist
  critiques. Shows current state of debate: defenders accept need for some
  mark of the cognitive but argue internalists' proposed marks are either too
  restrictive or orthogonal to internal-external boundary. For offloading
  research, suggests need for principled criteria distinguishing cognitive
  coupling from mere causal interaction—ongoing methodological challenge.

  POSITION: Extended mind defense arguing internalist critiques fail on their
  own terms and that coupling-based individuation is methodologically sound.

  abstract = {Clark and Chalmers (1998) introduced the extended mind hypothesis, according to which some mental states can be realized by non-biological external resources. A lively debate has flourished around this hypothesis, connected with the issues of embodiment, embeddedness, situatedness and enaction (cf. Clark, 2008; Menary, 2010; Shapiro, 2011). Two of the main criticisms addressed to the functionalist version of the extended mind thesis have been the so-called “coupling-constitution fallacy” and the alleged lack of a mark of the cognitive (Adams and Aizawa, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010a,b). According to Adams and Aizawa, extended cognition is a logical possibility, but is not instantiated in our world. Following this view, they defend a “contingent intracranialism,” based on a specific mark of the cognitive that they propose. In this paper I intend to show that neither criticism is effective against the extended cognition thesis. In particular: the mark of the cognitive proposed by Adams and Aizawa does not secure contingent intracranialism; the coupling-constitution fallacy criticizes extended cognition on precisely the point the theory was intended to defend: namely, that the best way to individuate cognitive systems, given a minimal mark of the cognitive, is to rely on coupling relations between agents and environmental resources.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that extended cognition faces a "dynamic boundary
  problem"—if cognitive systems are individuated by coupling relations, then
  cognitive system boundaries constantly shift as agents couple and decouple
  from external resources. This creates instability in what counts as "the"
  cognitive system and makes extended mind incompatible with treating cognitive
  systems as stable units for scientific investigation. Internal systems by
  contrast have principled boundaries (organismal boundaries) that remain
  stable through environmental interactions.

  RELEVANCE: Methodological critique focusing on empirical tractability of
  extended systems. For offloading research, raises question whether studying
  "extended cognitive systems" is scientifically coherent if system boundaries
  are constantly in flux. Suggests need for either stable individuation
  criteria or acceptance that "cognitive system" is not a useful explanatory
  kind in extended mind framework.

  abstract = {The notion of cognitive system is widely used in explanations in cognitive psychology and neuroscience. Traditional approaches define cognitive systems in an agent-relative way, that is, via top-down functional decomposition that assumes a cognitive agent as starting point. The extended cognition movement challenged that approach by questioning the primacy of the notion of cognitive agent. In response, [Adams, F., and K. Aizawa. 2001. The Bounds of Cognition. Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.] suggested that to have a clear understanding of what a cognitive system is we may need to solve "the demarcation challenge": the problem of identifying a reliable way to determine which mechanisms that are causally responsible for the production of a certain cognitive process constitute a cognitive system responsible for such process and which ones do not. Recently, [Rupert, R. 2009. Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.] offered a solution based on the idea that the mechanisms that constitute a cognitive system are integrated in a particular sense. In this paper I critically review Rupert's solution and argue against it. Additionally, I argue that a successful account of cognitive system must accommodate the fact that the neural mechanisms causally responsible for the production of a cognitive process are diachronically dynamic and yet functionally stable. At the end, I offer a suggestion as to how to accommodate this diachronic dynamicity without losing functional stability. I conclude by drawing some implications for the discussion on cognitive ontologies.},

  abstract = {Walter (2013) argues in that a bunch of externalist approaches examined in the theory of mind is interesting for psychiatry—especially for biological psychiatry. The externalist approaches state that mental states are not only constituted by internal but also by external factors. He subsumes them under the so-called 4E-thesis: embodied, embedded, extended, enacted. His example is concerned with ADHD such that ADHD is only existent “in an environment that favors attentional distraction and punishes hyperactivity.” 
  abstract_source = {s2},
 
First, using the 4E-thesis seems to be explanatorily attractive: There are factors of the disorder that can be grouped as external constituents and these constituents are not named by internalist vocabulary. For example, punishment is for sure not part of internalist vocabulary. 
 
But there is a figure of a principal argument against using the 4E-thesis in psychiatry. Consider this cookbook theory of the 4E-thesis: 
 
 
Cookbook theory for the 4E-thesis in accord with Henrik Walter's multilevel-approach: 
 
 
There is the phenomenon of a psychiatric disorder instanced in the form of multilevel-complexes. 
 
 
There are embodied, embedded, extended, or enacted (4E) constituents of cognition that realize the cognitive systems. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for the 4E-constituents. 
 
 
Coupled systems of individuated 4E-constituents individuate a multilevel-complex. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for systems of constituents C that realize multilevel-complexes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example, with respect to extended cognition, the cookbook theory is the following: 
 
 
Cookbook theory of extended cognition: 
 
 
There is the phenomenon of cognition of a group of patients in psychiatry instanced in the form of cognitive systems of a specific structure. 
 
 
There are vehicles of cognition that realize the cognitive systems named in 1. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for vehicles named in 2. 
 
 
Coupled systems of individuated vehicles individuate a cognitive system. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for systems of vehicles of cognition that realize cognitive systems named in 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As one can see, every attempt of the 4E-thesis needs criteria marking where to stop adding externalist constituents to the constituent base of the psychiatric disorder. For example, extended cognition-constituents should not include the whole world to make the thesis an interesting thesis—otherwise every phenomenon to be explained by extended cognition is constituted by the same constituents (i.e., the whole world). But what kind of criterion can the 4E-externalist provide us with? 
 
First, the 4E-externalist could give a criterion based on intrinsic properties of systems realizing disorders. But as a detailed analysis of criteria of this kind by Adams and Aizawa (2001, 2010) shows, these criteria are regularly based on finding a mark of the cognitive—which seems to be a hopeless endeavor without being a fundamentalist who just adds axiomatically this criterion to the cookbook theory. 
 
But second, the 4E-externalist could maybe give a criterion based on extrinsic properties of systems realizing psychiatric disorders. For example, one could use reliability as a stop-criterion for delineating what is coupled (with respect to point 4 in the cookbook theories). What is reliably coupled builds a constituent base of a system realizing a psychiatric disorder. But as a detailed analysis shows, this is not the case (Bukow and Will, in press). With respect to different criteria of reliability, there are very different reliable systems. This is not trivial, because in accord with the cookbook theory-approach, Bukow and Will argue: 
 
 
Argument for the arbitrariness of the reliability-predicate: 
 
 
Assume the cookbook theory of extended cognition. 
 
 
Give a definition of reliability with an operationalization (e.g., reproducibility as an operationalization). 
 
 
Choose an experimental procedure to test for reliability based on interaction between systems (because reliability is relative to this experimental procedure). 
 
 
Choose a value X%, i.e., that the experimental procedure is reproducible in X% of all series of experiments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no established decision procedure for the needed choices in points 3 and 4. And whatever procedure you choose, you may get different values for X% which will lead the psychiatrist to different constituent bases of the psychiatric disorder to be explained. Bukow and Will analyze in detail other candidates for criteria based on extrinsic properties, for example functional roles, causal roles, or heuristics. 
 
 
Now, there are two horns for the 4E-externalist: 
 
Horn 1: Use a stop-criterion based on intrinsic properties. The critics of Adam and Aizawa bite the proponent of this kind of criterion. If you add the criterion axiomatically, then you are a fundamentalist and not a scientist. 
 
Horn 2: Use a stop-criterion based on extrinsic properties. Then, there is the need to show in detail how to use such a criterion—which seems to be hopeless in accord with the investigation above. If you add the criterion without detailed analysis, then you are using just so-stories, without guarantee that the criterion fulfills its job. 
 
 
 
 
For these reasons, using the 4E-thesis is tempting but dangerous—there is no well-founded stop-criterion in philosophy of mind that a psychiatrist could use—not in a detailed way and not in a rough way. It is arbitrary what type and what token the psychiatrist may use with respect to the selection of constituents of a disorder. In a principal debate, the 4E-proponent may excuse these deficits because nobody may give in principal such stop-criteria. But in psychiatry, principal deficits are no excuse for misuse. Arbitrariness can smooth the way for use—but also for misuse in psychiatry, which is a dangerous zone with respect to rights and needs of patients of psychiatry. And if a psychiatrist can only give arbitrary constituent bases to a patient's disorder, then disorder and treatment will only arbitrarily be defined. This is, as far as I can see, an objection against Henrik Walter's argument for a mature “third wave” biological psychiatry.},

  abstract = {Abstract Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual.

  abstract = {The titleJoint Venturesalludes to Goldman's view that understanding cognition requires both scientific and philosophical expertise. "It would be", he notes, "intellectually irresponsible to ignore the huge swaths of evidence and theory that science has generated" (p. 3). Nevertheless, there is "ample place for philosophers to make theoretical contributions, to argue for this or that theoretical interpretation as the best explanation of the data" (p. 3). Cognitive science is thus a joint venture between philosophy and the behavioral sciences (p. 2). The rich and fascinating essays in this collection are testimony to Goldman's vision. The volume focuses on four themes to which he has made important contributions: simulation theory, empathy, embodied cognition, and the metaphysics of action. I will focus on the first three themes because they are striking examples of the "joint ventures" program.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Goldman has been a central figure in the study of mindreading for the last quarter of a century. The term "mindreading" refers to the capacity to predict others' behavior and explain it by attributing mental states to them. This capacity is also commonly referred to as "theory of mind". However, as Goldman points out, "theory of mind" confuses mindreading with a model of mindreading (p. 20). (This will become apparent in a moment.)

Broadly speaking, three models of mindreading exist in the literature (Ch. 1):

1.Theory-theory. Mindreading centrally involves the possession of a theory of mind ("folk psychology") which is deployed in roughly the same way that scientists deploy empirical theories to predict and explain aspect of the natural world.

2.The intentional stance. Mindreading involves taking a "stance" towards other people. They are assumed to be rational agents and the beliefs and desires attributed to them are those that a fully rational agent would have in the target's circumstances. The agent's behavior is predicted on the basis of the attributed states.

3.Simulation theory. The mindreader adopts the target's perspective and determines what she (the mindreader) would do if she were the target. That is, she uses her own mental processors to simulate those of the target, thereby predicting their behavior.

Goldman is without doubt the most significant simulation theorist. His earliest contribution greatly clarified simulation theory, moving it away from loose metaphors such as "putting oneself in the other's shoes" ('Interpretation Psychologized',Mind and Language4: 161-85, 1989). His views are best understood using the terminology, developed by Stephen Stich and Shaun Nichols, of "pretend inputs" and "off-line outputs" ('Folk psychology: Simulation or Tacit Theory?',Mind and Language7: 35-71, 1992). The pretend belief thatphas the same impact on practical decision making as the belief thatp, but differs from the belief thatpbecause it originates in different mental processes. Beliefs arise from perception and memory, and by reasoning from other beliefs; pretend beliefs arise from what is often called the "pretend belief and desire generator". Similarly, the pretend desire thatqhas the same impact on practical decision making as the desire thatq,but also arise from the pretend belief and desire generator.

In a successful episode of mindreading, the mindreader generates pretend beliefs and desires corresponding to the target's beliefs and desires. Provided the mindreader's decision making processes are sufficiently similar to the target's, she will arrive at a decision similar to the target's. However, the mindreader's decision does not lead directly to behavior; rather, her practical decision making processors are "off-line", with the decision leading to a prediction about the target's behavior (pp. 51-2).},
