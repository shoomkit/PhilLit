DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The parity principle, introduced by Clark and Chalmers (1998), holds that if an external process plays the same functional role as an internal one, it should count as cognitive. This domain encompasses the principle's formulation, major philosophical critiques, and proposed alternatives. The central debate revolves around whether functional parity is sufficient for cognitive status or whether additional criteria are needed.

Critics like Adams and Aizawa (2001) argue that parity leads to "cognitive bloat" and that genuine cognition requires non-derived content. Rupert (2004, 2009) challenges the principle via his Hypothesis of Embedded Cognition (HEC), proposing that cognitive systems are individuated by causal integration rather than parity. Sprevak (2009) and Wheeler (2010) explore whether functionalism entails extended mind, while Wheeler (2011) seeks conceptual clarification of what parity actually requires.

Recent work proposes alternatives to parity: Candiotto (2022) advances the "not possible without" principle emphasizing existential necessity; Goldstone (2019) introduces a "Reversed Parity Principle" for internal tool-building; Oliveira (2025) adds "maintainability" to trust-and-glue criteria. Smithies (2018) argues that epistemological accessibilism is incompatible with vehicle externalism, challenging parity from an epistemic angle.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the methodological foundations of extended mind theory. Understanding parity critiques illuminates why cognitive offloading cases may or may not constitute genuine cognitive extension. The debate over cognitive criteria shapes how we conceptualize the boundaries between cognitive processes and mere coupling.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers systematically compare parity with alternative principles across multiple case studies. Limited empirical testing of whether parity matches folk intuitions about cognition (though see experimental philosophy work by Y\u00fcksel 2025). Underdeveloped connection between parity debates and recent work on cognitive integration (Heersmink, Kirchhoff).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Structure synthesis around three positions: (1) pro-parity defenses (Wheeler, Clark), (2) anti-parity critiques demanding additional cognitive criteria (Adams & Aizawa, Rupert, Sprevak), (3) alternative principles that transcend or replace parity (Candiotto, Goldstone). Highlight how the debate shifted from whether parity is correct to what cognitive criteria should replace or supplement it.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Pro-Parity Functionalists: 2 papers - Defend functional parity as sufficient or necessary for cognitive status
- Anti-Parity Internalists: 6 papers - Argue parity is insufficient; demand mark of the cognitive, natural kinds, or other criteria
- Alternative Principles: 3 papers - Propose replacements for or supplements to parity
- Epistemological Critiques: 1 paper - Challenge parity on grounds of epistemic access
- Recent Applications: 4 papers - Apply parity debates to AI, privacy, consciousness

  CORE ARGUMENT: Adams and Aizawa argue that the extended mind thesis and parity principle lead to "cognitive bloat," wrongly counting too many external processes as cognitive. They propose that genuine cognition requires non-derived content—content that does not depend on interpretive conventions—which distinguishes brains from notebooks and calculators. The parity principle alone cannot demarcate cognitive boundaries without additional criteria specifying the "mark of the cognitive."

  RELEVANCE: This paper establishes the canonical internalist critique of parity that dominates subsequent debates. The demand for non-derived content as a cognitive criterion directly challenges parity-based arguments for cognitive offloading. Adams and Aizawa's cognitive bloat objection sets the agenda for defenders of extended mind who must either refine parity or offer alternative principles.

  POSITION: Anti-parity internalism. Argues parity is insufficient for cognitive status; endorses content-based demarcation criteria.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rupert develops the Hypothesis of Embedded Cognition (HEC) as an alternative to extended mind (HEC). HEC treats cognitive systems as brain-bound, individuated by dense causal integration rather than parity. Rupert argues that parity fails to capture the distinctive persisting causal integration that defines cognitive systems, and that treating external tools as cognitive parts ignores the crucial difference between constitutive and merely causal roles in cognitive processing.

  RELEVANCE: Rupert's HEC provides the major systems-based alternative to parity arguments. His emphasis on causal integration over functional parity shapes debates about what makes cognitive offloading genuinely cognitive versus merely instrumentally useful. The paper challenges whether parity can do the individuative work extended mind theorists need.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rupert's book-length treatment systematically develops the cognitive systems hypothesis (closely related to HEC) and argues that cognitive systems are individuated by persisting, dense causal coupling between components. He critiques parity by showing it misidentifies the boundary of cognitive systems, treating transient coupling as constitutive when it is merely causal. Rupert examines multiple case studies (memory, language, perception) to demonstrate that parity fails where systems-based criteria succeed.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most comprehensive critique of parity and extended mind from a systems perspective. Rupert's detailed treatment of cognitive systems individuation provides the strongest theoretical alternative to parity-based arguments. Essential for understanding why cognitive offloading might not constitute cognitive extension even when external tools play functionally similar roles.

  POSITION: Anti-parity, cognitive systems approach. Comprehensive critique of parity; defends systems-based cognitive boundaries.

  abstract = {Abstract This book surveys philosophical issues raised by the situated movement in cognitive science—the treatment of cognitive phenomena as the joint product of brain, body, and environment. The book focuses specifically on the hypothesis of extended cognition, according to which human cognitive processes literally comprise elements beyond the boundary of the human organism. A systems-based approach is held to provide the only plausible criterion distinguishing what is cognitive from what is not. In most human cases, this system appears within the boundary of the human organism. It is argued that the systems-based view explains the existing successes of cognitive psychology and cognate fields in a way that extended conceptions of cognition do not and, furthermore, that once the systems-based view has been adopted, it is especially clear how extant arguments in support of the extended view go wrong. Additional aspects of the situated program, including the embedded and embodied views, are also examined. The book considers whether plausible incarnations of such views depart from orthodox, computational cognitive science, especially with regard to the role of representation and computation. It is argued that the embedded and embodied views do not constitute radical shifts in perspective. For instance, properly understood, the embodied view does not offer a new role for the nonneural body, different in principle from the one presupposed by orthodox cognitive science.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sprevak examines whether functionalism about mental states entails the extended mind thesis. He argues that standard functionalist commitments do not automatically support parity-based arguments for extension because functionalists can individuate realizers at different grain levels. The paper distinguishes between coarse-grained functionalism (which may support extension) and fine-grained functionalism (which resists it), showing that the relationship between functionalism and parity is more complex than often assumed.

  RELEVANCE: Sprevak's paper is crucial for understanding whether parity arguments succeed given functionalist background assumptions common in philosophy of mind. The grain-of-realization issue he raises challenges simplistic appeals to parity, showing that even functional equivalence underdetermines cognitive boundaries. Relevant for assessing whether cognitive offloading cases satisfy functionalist criteria for cognitive status.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wheeler defends "extended functionalism" against critics like Rupert and Adams & Aizawa. He argues that properly understood functionalism does support extended mind when external elements satisfy the right functional profile, including appropriate coupling and reliability conditions. Wheeler contends that critics misconstrue what parity requires—it does not demand perfect identity but rather functional equivalence at the appropriate level of abstraction. The paper develops criteria for when external elements genuinely realize cognitive functions.

  RELEVANCE: Wheeler provides the most sophisticated defense of the compatibility between functionalism and parity. His account of appropriate functional equivalence refines what parity demands, addressing grain-of-realization worries. Essential for understanding how parity-based arguments can respond to internalist critiques while maintaining functionalist commitments.

  abstract = {Abstract This chapter aims to clarify the relationship between the extended cognition hypothesis (ExC) and functionalism, and to defend extended functionalism against three of its strongest criticisms. ExC claims that there are conditions under which thinking and thoughts are spatially distributed over the brain, body, and world in such a way that the external factors concerned are rightly accorded cognitive status. It is concerned mainly with the whereabouts of thinking and thoughts that is separate not only from the position adopted by orthodox cognitive science, but also from the position adopted by any embodied-embedded account of mind. Adams and Aizawa have repeatedly emphasized the insufficiency of thoughts being spatially distributed over brain, body, and world solely in the sense that applies when some instance of intelligent behavior is discovered to be causally dependent on the bodily exploitation of certain external props. The chapter concludes with a brief remark on extended functionalism and phenomenal consciousness.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wheeler clarifies what the parity principle actually requires, distinguishing it from caricatured versions attacked by critics. He argues that parity is not a simple identity claim but a methodological principle: if an external process would count as cognitive were it internal, then location alone should not disqualify it. The paper specifies that parity operates at the level of functional contribution, not implementational detail, and that it serves as a burden-shifting argument rather than a sufficient condition for cognitive status.

  RELEVANCE: This short paper is essential for understanding what parity claims and what it does not claim. Wheeler's clarifications dissolve some criticisms based on misunderstanding, while highlighting legitimate remaining challenges. The methodological interpretation of parity as burden-shifting rather than sufficient condition shapes how we evaluate cognitive offloading cases—parity shifts the burden to opponents to explain why location matters.

  doi = {10.1007/s13164-012-0129-9},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rupert argues that cognitive science terms like "memory" pick out natural kinds defined by specific mechanistic profiles, not mere functional roles. Parity-based arguments mistakenly treat functional equivalence as sufficient for category membership, when in fact cognitive kinds are individuated by deeper structural and mechanistic properties. A notebook may play a memory-like functional role, but this does not make it part of the memory system any more than a Martian with alien mechanisms would have human-type memory.

  RELEVANCE: This paper develops a natural kinds critique of parity that goes beyond the earlier cognitive bloat objection. Rupert's mechanistic individuationism challenges whether functional parity at any grain level suffices for cognitive status. The argument has direct implications for cognitive offloading: even if external tools play functionally equivalent roles, they may not instantiate the cognitive kinds studied by cognitive science.

  doi = {10.1007/s11229-015-0971-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Miyazono argues that functionalism does not entail the extended mind thesis because functionalists can adopt "intracranial chauvinism"—the view that realizers of mental states must be located in the head—without abandoning core functionalist commitments. The paper distinguishes between metaphysical functionalism (multiple realizability) and methodological functionalism (functional explanation), showing that only implausibly strong versions of functionalism support parity arguments. Standard functionalism is compatible with location-based constraints on cognitive realization.

  RELEVANCE: Miyazono's paper undermines a key motivation for parity: the assumption that functionalists must accept extended mind to avoid arbitrary location-based restrictions. By showing that location constraints can be functionally motivated, Miyazono challenges whether parity follows from functionalist commitments. Relevant for assessing whether appeals to functional equivalence alone can justify treating cognitive offloading as cognitive extension.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Candiotto proposes the "not possible without principle" as an alternative to the parity principle for socially extended cognition. While parity emphasizes functional equivalence and multiple realizability, the "not possible without principle" stresses existential necessity: some cognitive achievements are not merely achievable via social interaction but would be impossible without it. This shifts focus from functional substitutability to unique affordances of social, embodied, affectively-charged interactions that cannot be replicated by solitary processes.

  RELEVANCE: Candiotto's alternative principle challenges parity's emphasis on functional equivalence by highlighting cases where extension involves qualitative novelty rather than mere replication. This matters for cognitive offloading: the not-possible-without criterion distinguishes genuinely transformative cognitive extensions from functionally equivalent but existentially substitutable tools. The paper points toward non-functionalist criteria for cognitive extension.

  POSITION: Alternative principle. Proposes existential necessity criterion to replace or supplement parity.

  keywords = {social-cognition, alternative-principles, existential-necessity, Medium},
  abstract = {Through a discussion of the socially extended mind, this paper advances the “not possible without principle” as an alternative to the social parity principle. By charging the social parity principle with reductionism about the social dimension of socially extended processes, the paper offers a new argumentative strategy for the socially extended mind that stresses its existential significance. The “not possible without principle” shows that not only is something more achieved through socially located processes of knowledge building, but also that, and more importantly, what is achieved is something that would not have been possible without social interaction . The social parity principle states that the result of an activity achieved via social interaction should be assumed functionally equivalent to a solitary investigation and is characterized by multiple realisability. Contrary to the social parity principle, the “not possible without principle” holds that the result would not have been achieved without the social interaction between (at least) two agents with specific existential needs. The socially extended mind never happens in a void. This means that the "not possible without" principle should be located in real-life, affectively charged, embodied experiences of skilful interactions between agents. This fundamental conceptual change via reference to the “existential necessity” that regulates socially extended processes is necessary in order to effectively lead the socially extended mind to a truly embedded and embodied account.},

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190662813.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Goldstone introduces the "Reversed Parity Principle" (RPP): if external tools can become integrated parts of extended cognitive systems, then internal mental structures can likewise function as tools that feel foreign or "other" within the mind. While the extended mind thesis shows how we expand cognitively outward, the RPP reveals how we build internal cognitive tools (mathematical notation in our heads, linguistic scaffolds) that have a tool-like character. This inverts the direction of parity, using external tool integration to illuminate internal cognitive architecture.

  RELEVANCE: The RPP provides a novel perspective on parity by reversing its direction. Rather than asking whether external tools can be cognitive, Goldstone asks what parity reasoning reveals about internal cognitive structures. This matters for cognitive offloading: it suggests that internal and external tools may be more symmetrically related than traditional debates assume, challenging both internalist and externalist orthodoxies.

  POSITION: Alternative principle. Proposes reversed parity to illuminate internal cognitive tools.

In this chapter, a Reversed Parity Principle is outlined, which can be used to show how humans can “hack” their own minds in order to build inner mental tools, thus changing our existing cognitive abilities in yet another way. The Reversed Parity Principle (RRP) invites a perspectival shift that is potentially as illuminating as the extended mind shift. Whereas extended mind arguments invite us to think of ourselves as broader, wider, and larger than we might otherwise, the RPP invites us to consider the strangeness and otherness that lies within what would normally be considered to be “us.”},

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198769811.003.0002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Smithies argues that epistemic accessibilism (the view that justification requires reflective access to one's reasons) is incompatible with vehicle externalism/extended mind. The parity argument assumes that functional equivalence suffices for cognitive status, but this ignores crucial epistemic differences: internal beliefs are introspectively accessible in ways that external information sources are not. Smithies contends that this epistemic asymmetry defeats parity arguments, as it shows that location does make a justificatory difference.

  RELEVANCE: Smithies provides an epistemological rather than metaphysical critique of parity. The access-based argument challenges whether functionally equivalent internal and external states provide the same epistemic support for belief. This matters for cognitive offloading: even if external tools play equivalent functional roles, they may not provide equivalent epistemic access, undermining parity from an internalist epistemological perspective.

  POSITION: Epistemological critique of parity. Argues epistemic access requirements defeat vehicle externalism.

On the one hand, there is a compelling argument for vehicle externalism: the parity argument from Clark and Chalmers (1998). On the other hand, there is a compelling argument for accessibilism: the Moorean argument from Smithies (2012). If accessibilism is incompatible with vehicle externalism, then both arguments cannot be sound. I resolve the tension by arguing that the Moorean argument succeeds, while the parity argument fails, and hence that vehicle externalism should be rejected on broadly epistemological grounds.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Facchin examines whether predictive processing (PP) frameworks support extended mind via parity reasoning or undermine it via Markov blanket formalism. PP theorists appeal to functional parity between internal prediction and external scaffolding, but the Markov blanket formalism used in PP defines cognitive systems by statistical boundaries that typically align with biological organisms. Facchin argues that PP's dual commitments create tension: parity reasoning pulls toward extension, while Markov blanket individuation pulls toward organism-bound cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Oliveira proposes adding "maintainability" as a fourth criterion to Clark and Chalmers' trust-glue-accessibility conditions for cognitive extension in AI contexts. While parity focuses on functional equivalence, maintainability addresses whether users can control and modify the AI systems they cognitively integrate with. This criterion responds to AI's capacity to learn user psychology and potentially manipulate cognitive processes, creating a power asymmetry not addressed by traditional parity reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: This recent paper extends parity debates to AI-human cognitive coupling, showing that functional equivalence is insufficient when external cognitive partners are adaptive and potentially manipulative. The maintainability criterion matters for cognitive offloading involving AI: even functionally equivalent AI tools may fail to constitute genuine cognitive extension if users cannot maintain control over the integration. Points toward power-sensitive supplements to parity.

We argue that AI, as an active non-organic agent, significantly influences cognitive processes beyond initial expectations. Secondly, we propose the maintainability as a fourth criterion in the Trust and Glue criteria of ExM, in addition to trustworthiness, reliability and accessibility. This addition aims to evaluate parity in coupled systems comprehensively addressing concerns about control in human-AI interactions. We highlight the risks posed by AI’s understanding of human psychology, which may lead to unintended shifts in our objectives and choices.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Greif develops an aetiological functionalist approach to extended mind that adds evolutionary and developmental history to parity-based functional equivalence. He argues that extended cognitive traits should be grounded in evolved biological functions shaped by organism-environment coevolution. This historical dimension supplements synchronic parity by requiring that cognitive extensions emerge from long-term adaptive coupling between organisms and environmental features, not merely transient functional equivalence.

  RELEVANCE: Greif's aetiological approach addresses a key weakness of parity reasoning: it cannot distinguish stable, evolved cognitive extensions from transient functional couplings. By adding historical depth to parity, Greif provides criteria for when functional equivalence reflects genuine cognitive integration versus temporary scaffolding. Relevant for distinguishing deep cognitive offloading (writing, cultural tools) from shallow offloading (Google search).

These two related questions are best answered in the light of an aetiological variety of functionalist argument that adds historical depth to the “active externalism” promoted by Clark and Chalmers and helps to counter some of the core criticisms levelled against this view. Under additional reference to conceptual parallels between the Extended Mind Hypothesis and a set of heterodox theories in biology—environmental constructivism, niche construction, developmental systems theory—an argument for the grounding of environmentally extended cognitive traits in evolved biological functions is developed. In a spirit that seeks to integrate extended functionalism with views from cognitive integration and complementarity, it is argued (ad 1) that instances of environmental coupling should be understood as being constitutive to cognitive functions in either of two distinct ways. It is further argued (ad 2) that the historically and systematically prior environmental counterparts in that coupling are features of the natural environment.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vold examines whether parity arguments that work for extended cognition can be extended to consciousness. She analyzes whether functional parity between internal and external contributions to phenomenal experience could support extended phenomenology. The paper explores key disanalogies: consciousness involves subjective character that may not supervene on functional role alone, creating challenges for parity-based arguments that succeed for non-phenomenal cognition.

  RELEVANCE: Vold's paper tests parity reasoning at its limits by applying it to consciousness. The analysis reveals where parity arguments face special difficulties: phenomenal properties may resist functional individuation in ways that cognitive properties do not. Relevant for understanding scope limits of parity—if it fails for consciousness, this illuminates what parity can and cannot establish about cognitive offloading.

  POSITION: Analyzes parity application to consciousness; identifies scope limits.
