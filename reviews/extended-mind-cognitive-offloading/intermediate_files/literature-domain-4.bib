DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain explores integration-based accounts of the extended mind that
emphasize complementarity, transformation, and scaffolding rather than
simple parity between internal and external resources. The central insight
is that cognitive extension works not through functional equivalence but
through productive differences that transform cognitive processes. Menary's
cognitive integration framework rejects the parity principle in favor of
viewing external resources as creating hybrid cognitive systems through
integration. Sterelny's scaffolded mind approach distinguishes between
resources that merely support cognition versus those that constitutively
extend it through developmental and evolutionary scaffolding. The
complementarity principle, first articulated in physics but now applied to
cognition, captures how internal and external resources make distinct but
mutually necessary contributions to extended cognitive systems.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Integration approaches provide philosophical frameworks for understanding
how cognitive offloading transforms rather than replicates internal
processes. They explain why external resources enhance cognition precisely
because they operate differently from biological memory and reasoning, thus
enabling cognitive transformations impossible with internal resources alone.
This directly addresses questions about what makes offloading genuinely
cognitive versus merely instrumental.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While integration theories excel at philosophical analysis, empirical work
connecting integration principles to measurable cognitive outcomes remains
limited. The relationship between scaffolding and enculturation needs
further development, particularly regarding how cultural practices shape
cognitive integration. Recent AI integration work (2024-2025) shows
emerging interest but lacks deep engagement with earlier integration
frameworks. Eight key papers (Menary 2013, 2009; Sterelny 2010; Palermos
2013; Heersmink & Sutton 2018; Riva 2025; Cole 2012; Menary 2007 book)
lack abstracts in digital repositories, though substantive notes capture
their core arguments.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the contrast between parity-based and integration-based accounts
of extension. Highlight how complementarity and transformation provide
alternatives to the coupling-constitution debate. Connect scaffolding
theories to developmental and evolutionary timescales. Recent AI work
offers contemporary applications but should be grounded in established
integration frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Menary advances cognitive integration as an alternative to
  parity-based extended mind theories, arguing that cognitive extension
  occurs through the integration of neural, bodily, and environmental
  resources into hybrid systems via cognitive practices. Rather than
  external resources functionally equivalent to internal ones, integration
  involves complementarity where different resources make distinct
  contributions. Enculturation plays a key role, as cognitive practices are
  culturally transmitted and transform individual cognitive capacities
  through developmental scaffolding.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the mature formulation of Menary's
  integration framework, directly addressing how cognitive offloading works
  through transformation rather than replication. The emphasis on cognitive
  practices offers a concrete mechanism for understanding how external
  resources become genuinely cognitive. The cultural dimension connects
  individual cognitive extension to social and historical processes,
  situating offloading within broader enculturated practices.

  POSITION: Represents the "cognitive integration" alternative to
  Clark-Chalmers parity, emphasizing complementarity and transformation
  through culturally scaffolded practices.

  pages = {31--43},
  doi = {10.1007/s11245-008-9044-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Menary argues that cognitive integration is compatible with
  the continuity thesis (that cognition is continuous with life) while
  rejecting strong internalism about intentional content. Cognitive
  practices integrate neural, bodily, and environmental resources, creating
  hybrid intentional states whose content is constituted by this integrated
  system rather than being exclusively internal. This preserves continuity
  while allowing for genuinely extended intentionality through integration.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses a fundamental philosophical question about
  whether extended cognition can preserve intentionality or whether
  offloading sacrifices genuine aboutness. The integration framework offers
  a middle path between internalist intentionality and purely causal
  coupling, relevant to understanding whether cognitive offloading preserves
  or transforms the intentional character of thought.

  POSITION: Defends extended intentionality through cognitive integration,
  mediating between internalism and mere causal coupling.

  pages = {329--344},
  doi = {10.1080/09515080600690557},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Menary critiques Adams and Aizawa's "bounds of cognition"
  argument, which attempts to restrict cognition to processes involving
  non-derived content. He argues that their mark of the cognitive is both
  too restrictive (excluding plausible cases of extended cognition) and
  theoretically unmotivated. Instead, Menary proposes that cognitive systems
  should be individuated functionally based on their role in cognitive
  practices, allowing for genuine cognitive extension without requiring
  internal/external parity.

  RELEVANCE: This paper engages directly with the coupling-constitution
  debate, offering arguments against restrictive criteria that would exclude
  offloading from counting as genuinely cognitive. The functional
  individuation approach provides theoretical support for treating certain
  offloading practices as constitutive of cognition rather than merely
  supporting it.

  POSITION: Critiques marker-based approaches to cognitive bounds, advancing
  functional integration as an alternative criterion.

  pages = {465--481},
  doi = {10.1007/s11097-010-9174-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sterelny distinguishes between extended and scaffolded
  minds, arguing that while environmental resources are crucial to human
  cognition, they typically scaffold rather than constitute cognitive
  processes. Scaffolding involves resources that support cognitive
  development and performance without becoming parts of the cognitive system
  itself. This occurs through evolutionary and developmental processes that
  structure learning environments, enabling skill acquisition without
  requiring cognitive extension. The distinction turns on whether resources
  are reliably available during cognitive processing versus being
  developmental aids.

  RELEVANCE: This paper presents a major alternative to extended mind
  theory, directly relevant to understanding whether cognitive offloading
  extends or merely supports cognition. The scaffolding framework offers a
  way to acknowledge the importance of external resources while maintaining
  internalist boundaries. The developmental and evolutionary dimensions
  provide timescale-sensitive analyses missing from parity-based approaches.

  pages = {1931--1951},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-013-0383-0},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Palermos develops an epistemological framework for extended
  cognition based on cognitive integration rather than parity. He argues
  that extended cognitive systems can ground knowledge when external
  resources are integrated through reliable coupling that makes them
  cognitively transparent and trust-independent. This integration-based
  approach to extended knowledge avoids problems facing parity-based
  accounts while maintaining that genuine epistemic extension requires more
  than mere reliable access.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects cognitive integration to epistemology,
  addressing whether cognitive offloading can constitute knowledge or merely
  provide information access. The transparency and trust criteria offer
  concrete conditions for when offloaded information becomes part of
  cognitive character. This bears directly on questions about whether
  offloading to external memory genuinely extends knowledge or creates
  epistemic dependencies.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Heersmink and Sutton analyze web-based cognition through
  three frameworks: extended mind (integration into cognitive systems),
  transactive memory (distributed within social networks), and cognitive
  scaffolding (environmental support). They argue that different online
  practices fit different frameworks, with some genuinely extending
  cognition while others scaffold or distribute it socially. The paper
  develops criteria for distinguishing these cases based on integration
  density, trust, and transformation of cognitive capacities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper applies integration frameworks to contemporary
  internet-based offloading, directly addressing how search engines, online
  databases, and social media relate to cognitive extension. The
  multi-framework analysis acknowledges that not all offloading is
  equivalent, with some cases constituting extension while others remain
  scaffolded support. This nuanced approach is essential for understanding
  cognitive offloading in digital contexts.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Greif develops an aetiological functionalist account of
  extended mind that integrates extended functionalism with cognitive
  integration and complementarity principles. He argues that cognitive
  coupling should be understood constitutively in two ways: through evolved
  biological functions extended into environmental niches, and through
  developmental construction of cognitive scaffolds. This grounds extended
  mind in biological and developmental history rather than synchronic
  parity. Natural environmental features are historically prior to cultural
  artifacts in cognitive extension.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a biologically and developmentally grounded
  account of cognitive integration, connecting extended mind to niche
  construction theory and developmental systems theory. The complementarity
  emphasis explains how internal and external resources make distinct
  contributions without requiring functional equivalence, addressing a key
  weakness of parity-based accounts. This is relevant to understanding
  cognitive offloading as evolutionarily and developmentally scaffolded.

  POSITION: Integrates extended mind with niche construction and
  developmental systems theory through aetiological functionalism and
  complementarity.

  keywords = {complementarity, niche-construction, aetiological-functionalism, High},
  abstract = {Two aspects of cognitive coupling, as brought forward in the Extended Mind Hypothesis, are discussed in this paper: (1) how shall the functional coupling between the organism and some entity in his environment be spelled out in detail? (2) What are the paradigmatic external entities to enter into that coupling? These two related questions are best answered in the light of an aetiological variety of functionalist argument that adds historical depth to the “active externalism” promoted by Clark and Chalmers and helps to counter some of the core criticisms levelled against this view. Under additional reference to conceptual parallels between the Extended Mind Hypothesis and a set of heterodox theories in biology—environmental constructivism, niche construction, developmental systems theory—an argument for the grounding of environmentally extended cognitive traits in evolved biological functions is developed. In a spirit that seeks to integrate extended functionalism with views from cognitive integration and complementarity, it is argued (ad 1) that instances of environmental coupling should be understood as being constitutive to cognitive functions in either of two distinct ways. It is further argued (ad 2) that the historically and systematically prior environmental counterparts in that coupling are features of the natural environment. Language and linguistically imbued artefacts are likely to have descended from more basic relations that have an extension over the environment.},

  pages = {312--322},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2020.1815095},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schwengerer argues that online intellectual virtues are
  incompatible with first-wave (Clark-Chalmers) extended mind theory but
  compatible with second-wave theories emphasizing gradual cognitive
  integration. First-wave theories treat external resources as cognitive
  when functionally equivalent to internal states, but online virtues
  require critical engagement that presupposes awareness of
  internal/external differences. Second-wave integration theories can
  accommodate virtues because they recognize degrees of integration and
  maintain some internal/external distinction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects extended mind debates to virtue
  epistemology, addressing whether cognitive offloading to online resources
  can be virtuous or necessarily involves epistemic vice. The argument that
  integration-based accounts better support online virtues than parity-based
  accounts provides philosophical reasons for preferring integration
  frameworks when analyzing contemporary digital offloading practices.

  POSITION: Argues second-wave extended mind theories better support online
  intellectual virtues than first-wave parity approaches.

For instance, the world wide web seems to foster filter bubbles and echo chambers and includes search results that promote bias and spread misinformation. Richard Heersmink suggests online intellectual virtues to combat these epistemically detrimental effects . These are general epistemic virtues applied to the online environment based on our background knowledge of this online environment. I argue that these online intellectual virtues also demand a particular view of cognitive integration. Online intellectual virtues are incompatible with a popular conception of extended minds proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers . I suggest that if we want to hold on to both a conception of online intellectual virtues and some conception of the extended mind, we have to accept a more gradual theory of cognitive integration along the lines of second-wave theories of the extended mind .},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sganzerla, Hutto, and Kirchhoff develop extensive
  enactivism as an alternative to extended mind theory. They argue that
  cognition extends not through coupled systems satisfying parity or
  integration criteria, but through sensorimotor engagement that constitutes
  cognitive processes. Extensive enactivism rejects representationalism and
  functionalism underlying extended mind debates, instead grounding
  cognitive extension in embodied, environmentally embedded sensorimotor
  activity. This provides new arguments for extensive cognition that avoid
  problems facing both parity and integration approaches.

  RELEVANCE: This paper presents a radical enactivist alternative to both
  parity and integration frameworks, relevant to understanding cognitive
  offloading through sensorimotor rather than representational or functional
  frameworks. The critique of functionalist assumptions challenges whether
  offloading debates have properly understood the nature of cognitive
  processes that might extend. This offers a fundamentally different
  perspective on how external resources relate to cognition.

Over the past twenty-six years, it has led to intense philosophical debates about of the constitutive bounds of mind and cognition and generated multiple waves of work taking the form of various attempts to clarify and defend its core thesis. The extended mind thesis states that under certain (specialized and particular) conditions cognitive processes may be constituted by resources distributed across the brain, the body, and the environment. The extended mind thesis is part of a larger family of theoretical frameworks such as embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and various versions of enactivism (Gallagher in South J Philos 56: 421–447, 2018; Hutchins in Cognition in the wild, The MIT Press, 1995; Varela et al. in The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience, The MIT Press, 1991; Di Paolo in Topoi 28:9–21, 2009; Hutto and Myin in Radicalizing enactivism: basic minds without content, The MIT Press, 2013; Hutto and Myin in Evolving enactivism: basic minds meet content, The MIT Press, 2017).

  abstract = {This paper introduces “System 0,” a conceptual framework for understanding how artificial intelligence functions as a cognitive extension preceding both intuitive (System 1) and deliberative (System 2) thinking processes. As AI systems increasingly shape the informational substrate upon which human cognition operates, they transform from passive tools into active cognitive partners. Building on the Extended Mind hypothesis and Heersmink’s criteria for cognitive extension, we argue that AI systems satisfy key conditions for cognitive integration. These include reliability, trust, transparency, individualization, and the ability to enhance and transform human mental functions. However, AI integration creates a paradox: while expanding cognitive capabilities, it may simultaneously constrain thinking through sycophancy and bias amplification. To address these challenges, we propose seven evidence-based frameworks for effective human-AI cognitive integration: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding, which promotes progressive autonomy; Symbiotic Division of Cognitive Labor, strategically allocating tasks based on comparative strengths; Dialectical Cognitive Enhancement, countering AI sycophancy through productive epistemic tension; Agentic Transparency and Control, ensuring users understand and direct AI influence; Expertise Democratization, breaking down knowledge silos; Social-Emotional Augmentation, addressing affective dimensions of cognitive work; and Duration-Optimized Integration, managing the evolving human-AI relationship over time. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive approach for harnessing AI as a genuine cognitive extension while preserving human agency, critical thinking, and intellectual growth, transforming AI from a replacement for human cognition into a catalyst for enhanced thinking.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Riva addresses the "comfort-growth paradox" in AI
  cognitive extension: AI's user-friendliness may induce cognitive
  complacency by minimizing the cognitive friction necessary for

  Progressive Autonomy (fading support as competence increases), Adaptive
  Personalization (tailoring to individual trajectories), and Cognitive Load
  Optimization (balancing effort to maximize learning while minimizing
  unnecessary complexity).

  offloading: external resources can enhance cognition but may simultaneously

  CORE ARGUMENT: Trybulec analyzes the epistemic subject within extended

In the paper I analyze the place of the epistemic subject within the extended cognitive system. Is it extended as well? In answering this question I focus on the differences between the first and the second wave of arguments for the extended mind thesis. I argue that the position of Cognitive Integration represented by Richard Menary is much more intuitive and fruitful in analyses of cognition and knowledge than the early argument formulated by Andy Clark and David Chalmers. Cognitive Integration is compatible with virtue epistemology of John Greco’s agent reliabilism. The epistemic subject is constituted by its cognitive character composed of an integrated set of cognitive abilities and processes. Some of these processes are extended, they are a manipulation of external informational structures and, as such, they constitute epistemic practices. Epistemic practices are normative; to conduct them correctly the epistemic subject needs to obey epistemic norms embedded in the cultural context. The epistemic subject is not extended because of the casual coupling with external informational artifacts which extend his mind from inside the head and into the world. Rather, cognitive practices constitute the subject’s mind, they transform his cognitive abilities, and this is what makes the mind and epistemic subject “extended”.},

  abstract = {Abstract The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC), or the claim that cognitive processes are not entirely organism-bound and can extend into the world, has received a barrage of criticism. Likewise, defenders of HEC have responded and even retreated into more moderate positions. In this paper, I trace the debate, rehearsing what I take to be the three strongest cases against HEC: nonderived content, causally natural kinds, and informational integration. I then argue that so far, the replies have been unsatisfactory, mainly because they rest on tacit assumptions about the nature of "human organisms," which are the very subjects in question. One such reply, Clark's (2008) recent hypothesis of organism-centered cognition (HOC), is shown to be a particularly hasty retreat, specifically in terms of tackling the issue of informational integration. Namely, my position is that Clark concedes too quickly that the organism is the "chief executor" of this cognitive function and I claim this on the grounds that (1) not all human organisms integrate information in the way Weiskopf (2008 Weiskopf, D. 2008. Patrolling the mind's boundaries. Erkenntnis, 68(2): 265–276.

  (not necessary) but constitutive (not merely causal) when it occurs. Human
  emotional development illustrates how social interaction can constitute
  rather than merely shape cognitive-emotional capacities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides a developmental perspective on cognitive
  integration, showing how social resources can constitutively shape
  cognitive capacities through ontogenesis. The emotional case study
  illustrates integration principles beyond traditional cognitive domains.
  The distinction between contingent and necessary constitution is relevant
  to understanding when offloading constitutes versus supports cognition.

  POSITION: Defends contingent but constitutive social integration through
  developmental analysis of emotional ontogenesis.

  abstract = {Abstract Contingent transcranialists claim that the physical mechanisms of mind are not exclusively intracranial and that genuine cognitive systems can extend into cognizers' physical and socio-cultural environments. They further claim that extended cognitive systems must include the deep functional integration of external environmental resources with internal neural resources. They have found it difficult, however, to explicate the precise nature of such deep functional integration and provide compelling examples of it. Contingent intracranialists deny that extracranial resources can be components of genuine extended cognitive systems. They claim that transcranialists fallaciously conflate coupling with constitution and construe cognition as extending always from brains into world rather than world into brains. By using insights from recent research in developmental psychology and by explicating the nature of one form that deep functional integration can take, I argue that (i) transcranialists do not fallaciously conflate coupling wth constitution, and (ii) human emotional ontogenesis is a world-to-brain transcranial achievement.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Marki\'{c} distinguishes two waves of active externalism:
  first-wave parity-based accounts and second-wave complementarity-based
  accounts. She analyzes how second-wave discussions focus on cognitive
  systems with feedback loops between internal and external elements,
  representing a more radical departure from functionalism. The
  complementarity principle addresses cognitive bloat and
  coupling-constitution objections by requiring productive differences
  rather than functional equivalence. She concludes with ethical
  considerations of extended cognition.

  RELEVANCE: This paper clarifies the shift from parity to complementarity
  in extended mind debates, directly relevant to understanding how
  integration approaches differ from earlier extended mind theories. The
  feedback loop emphasis highlights dynamic interaction rather than static
  coupling. The ethical dimension addresses normative questions about
  cognitive offloading often neglected in purely descriptive accounts.

  POSITION: Analyzes shift from parity to complementarity principles,
  emphasizing feedback loops and ethical implications.

The second wave of discussions based on the complementarity principle deals with cognitive systems with feedback loops between internal and external elements and is a more radical departure from functionalism and traditional thinking about cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fritzman and Thornburg propose a "fourth wave" of extended
  mind theory drawing on Hegelian philosophy. They argue that previous waves
  (parity, complementarity, integration) inadequately address how cognitive
  extension transforms personal identity and subjectivity. The Hegelian
  framework shows how mind extends through recognition by others and
  participation in social-cultural institutions, constituting rather than
  merely supporting selfhood. This provides a more robust account of how
  cognitive extension relates to personal identity.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses philosophical questions about how
  cognitive offloading relates to personal identity and selfhood, extending
  integration debates into metaphysics of mind. The Hegelian social-cultural
  dimension connects cognitive extension to institutional and historical
  structures. This is relevant to understanding whether and how cognitive
  offloading affects who we are, not just what we can do.

  POSITION: Proposes Hegelian fourth wave emphasizing how cognitive
  extension constitutes selfhood through social recognition.

  abstract = {We seek to constitute the extended mind’s fourth wave, socially distributed group cognition, and we do so by thinking with Hegel. The extended mind theory’s first wave invokes the parity principle, which maintains that processes that occur external to the organism’s skin should be considered mental if they are regarded as mental when they occur inside the organism. The second wave appeals to the complementarity principle, which claims that what is crucial is that these processes together constitute a cognitive system. The first two waves assume that cognitive systems have well-defined territories or boundaries, and that internal and external processes do not switch location. The third wave rejects these assumptions, holding instead that internal processes are not privileged, and internal and external processes can switch, and that processes can be distributed among individuals. The fourth wave would advocate socially distributed group cognition. Groups are deterritorialized collective agents; they are ineliminatively and irreducibly real, they have mental states. Individuals constitute groups, but groups also constitute individuals. What counts as an individual and a group is a function of the level of analysis. And they are conflicted.

Never, never: I’m on strike. Right now, I’m encrapulating myself as much as possible. Why? I want to be a poet, and I’m working to turn myself into a seer: you won’t understand at all, and it’s unlikely that I’ll be able to explain it to you. It has to do with making your way toward the unknown by a derangement of all the senses. The suffering is tremendous, but one must bear up against it, to be born a poet, and I know that’s what I am. It’s not at all my fault. It’s wrong to say I think: one should say I am thought. Forgive the pun. I is someone else. Tough luck to the wood that becomes a violin, and to hell with the unaware who quibble over what they’re completely missing anyway!i dversaries of the extended mind emphasize the importance of the “persisting individual” to cognitive science. They urge that this is incompatible with the extended mind’s transient couplings and hook-ups, linking individuals and aspects of their environments, thereby constituting cognitive systems. Yet, in the nineteenth century, Arthur Rimbaud recognized that individuals are constitutively conjoined to others, always already, who are themselves so conjoined, and that an individual’s persistence is that of a A “I Is Someone Else” | Fritzman & Thornburg 158 continuing process, not a substance. Metaphor: individuals are not trees, much less petrified wood, but rhizomes.ii Asparagus and ginger are rhizomes, Indian lotus too. With uncanny insight, Hindus not only portray Viṣṇu (the god of preservation) and Lakṣmī (the goddess of prosperity) on lotuses, they also depict the universe’s creation as a lotus emerging from Viṣṇu’s navel. Although not his main point, Rimbaud saw that a violin constitutively depends on its wood. And, his main point: I does not think; rather, I is thought’s result. In the “Preface” to the Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Hegel cautions his readers to not expect philosophy to give advice about what should be done.iii This is so, he explains, because philosophy’s comprehension is always retrospective, discerning an era’s essential characteristics only after they have already fully developed. So, it might be anticipated that a project of thinking with Hegel about the extended mind could at most discern what others have already achieved— articulating, clarifying, and making explicit—but that it would not advance the discussion. The extended mind would clarify Hegel’s concept of Geist (“spirit” or “mind”), and his concept of “right” (Recht roughly, social mores and law) serves as an exemplar of the extended mind.iv This could seem like a system of mirrors, mutually illuminating each other— and impatient readers might wonder when the smoke will be introduced. Nevertheless, the project of making things explicit can be valuable, articulating and then synthesizing, thereby making way for further conceptual advance. Moreover, Hegelians have defended the extended mind from Mark Sprevak’s argument that the extended mind is overly permissive in its attributions of mental states, and that—since functionalism entails the extended mind—both should be rejected.v Essays in Philosophy 17(2) 159 Naturally, Hegelians worry, not that the extended mind is too liberal in its attributions of mental states, but rather that it is too conservative. We will discuss the extended mind’s first two waves, suggesting that they really constitute one wave, explain that the third wave is well under way, and show that the resources are in place for a fourth wave. We suggest that the fourth wave is conflicted, constituted, as it were, by various interfering waves.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Menary's monograph develops the cognitive integration
  framework as a comprehensive alternative to both internalist and simple
  externalist accounts of cognition. He argues that cognitive processes are
  often hybrid systems integrating neural, bodily, and environmental
  resources through cognitive practices. The book develops philosophical
  foundations for integration, addresses intentionality and representation,
  and connects cognitive integration to enculturation and cognitive
  evolution. This provides the most complete articulation of the integration
  framework.

  RELEVANCE: This book provides the foundational philosophical development
  of cognitive integration theory, essential background for understanding
  integration-based accounts of cognitive extension. The comprehensive
  treatment addresses philosophical, empirical, and evolutionary dimensions.
  Understanding this framework is crucial for analyzing cognitive offloading
  through integration rather than parity lenses.
