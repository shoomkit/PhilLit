## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the research space at the intersection of philosophical theory about cognitive extension and empirical research on cognitive offloading, establishing why this intersection matters for understanding both the boundaries of cognition and the consequences of technology use.

**Content**:
- Open with the core question motivating the extended mind thesis: where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin? Introduce Clark and Chalmers (1998) and the parity principle as the originating framework. Note that the thesis has generated over two decades of philosophical debate while a parallel empirical tradition on cognitive offloading has developed largely independently.
- State the specific problem: philosophical debates about extended cognition have primarily engaged with thought experiments (Otto's notebook), while empirical offloading research measures actual behavior -- yet these literatures have been insufficiently integrated. The question is whether and how each informs the other.
- Articulate why this matters: digital technologies (smartphones, internet, AI) have made cognitive offloading pervasive, making the philosophical question of cognitive boundaries practically urgent. If minds genuinely extend, then tool design is cognitive system design and disruption of access is cognitive impairment.
- Preview the review's structure: (1) the philosophical architecture of the extended mind debate, including parity, coupling-constitution, and integration approaches; (2) empirical findings on cognitive offloading, particularly metacognitive mechanisms; (3) digital technologies as contemporary test cases where philosophical and empirical questions converge; (4) critical perspectives and alternative frameworks.

**Key Papers**: Clark and Chalmers (1998) [clarkChalmers1998extended], Clark (2008) [clark2008supersizing], Adams and Aizawa (2001) [adamsAizawa2001bounds / adams2001bounds], Gilbert et al. (2022) [Gilbert2022outsourcing], Sparrow et al. (2011) [Sparrow2011google / sparrow2011google]

## Section 1: The Philosophical Architecture of Extended Cognition

**Section Purpose**: Map the central philosophical debates that define the extended mind thesis, tracing the evolution from parity-based arguments through internalist critiques to integration-based alternatives. This section establishes the conceptual machinery needed to evaluate whether cognitive offloading constitutes genuine cognitive extension.

**Main Claims**:
1. The extended mind thesis rests on functionalist commitments and the parity principle, but these foundations have been challenged on multiple fronts -- from demands for a "mark of the cognitive" to concerns about the coupling-constitution inference.
2. The debate has evolved from first-wave parity-based arguments to second-wave integration and complementarity approaches, which reconceptualize what cognitive extension involves and offer different criteria for when external resources become genuinely cognitive.

### Subsection 1.1: Active Externalism and the Parity Principle

**Papers**: Clark and Chalmers (1998) [clarkChalmers1998extended], Clark (2008) [clark2008supersizing], Wheeler (2010) [wheeler2010defense], Wheeler (2011) [wheeler2011parity], Rowlands (2010) [rowlands2010new]

**Content**: Present the original extended mind thesis: active externalism, the parity principle, and the Otto-Inga thought experiment. Explain how Clark and Chalmers argue that external resources constitutively contribute to cognitive processes when they play the same functional role as internal states. Note Clark's (2008) introduction of trust, glue, and accessibility conditions as constraints on extension. Present Wheeler's (2010, 2011) clarification that parity is a methodological burden-shifting argument, not a sufficient condition for cognitive status. Note Rowlands' (2010) systematic taxonomy situating extended mind within the broader embodied cognition program.

**Connection to research**: These foundational arguments provide the theoretical framework against which cognitive offloading must be evaluated. The parity principle implies that if offloaded processes are functionally equivalent to internal ones, they should count as cognitive.

### Subsection 1.2: Internalist Critiques -- The Mark of the Cognitive and the Coupling-Constitution Debate

**Papers**: Adams and Aizawa (2001) [adamsAizawa2001bounds / adams2001bounds], Adams and Aizawa (2010) [adams2010bounds / adams2010defending], Rupert (2004) [rupert2004challenges], Rupert (2009) [rupert2009cognitive], Sprevak (2009) [sprevak2009extended], Smithies (2018) [smithies2018access], Rupert (2013) [rupert2013memory]

**Content**: Present Adams and Aizawa's coupling-constitution fallacy charge: that proponents infer constitution from mere causal coupling. Their proposed "mark of the cognitive" -- non-derived content -- restricts cognition to processes with intrinsic intentionality. Present Rupert's alternative systems-based critique: cognitive systems should be individuated by persisting dense causal integration, not functional equivalence, and external resources differ systematically from internal processes in portability, reliability, and accessibility. Address Sprevak's (2009) argument that standard functionalism does not straightforwardly entail extended cognition because of grain-of-realization issues. Include Rupert's (2013) natural kinds argument: cognitive science terms like "memory" pick out mechanistic natural kinds, not mere functional roles. Note Smithies' (2018) epistemological challenge: epistemic access requirements create asymmetries between internal beliefs and external information sources that defeat parity arguments.

**Connection to research**: These critiques directly challenge whether cognitive offloading constitutes genuine extension. If cognition requires non-derived content or dense causal integration, then offloading to a notebook or smartphone -- however functionally similar -- remains merely instrumental.

### Subsection 1.3: Integration, Complementarity, and Beyond Parity

**Papers**: Menary (2006) [menary2006attacking], Menary (2007) [menary2007cognitive -- Domain 4], Menary (2010) [menary2010introduction / menary2010cognitive], Menary (2013) [menary2013cognitive], Sterelny (2010) [sterelny2010minds], Kirchhoff (2013) [kirchhoff2014extended], Greif (2015/2017) [greif2015extension / greif2017what], Palermos (2013) [palermos2013knowledge]

**Content**: Present the second wave of extended mind arguments. Menary's cognitive integration framework argues that external resources extend cognition not through functional equivalence but through complementary contributions integrated via learned cognitive practices. Enculturation plays a constitutive role: cognitive extension develops through acquisition of culturally scaffolded skills like writing and mathematical notation. Sterelny (2010) distinguishes scaffolded minds from extended minds, arguing that external resources typically scaffold rather than constitute cognition through evolutionary and developmental processes -- a position that acknowledges external resource dependence while resisting constitutive extension claims. Kirchhoff (2013) proposes mutual manipulability from mechanistic philosophy of science as a criterion for cognitive constitution, offering empirically grounded criteria. Greif (2015/2017) adds an aetiological dimension: cognitive extension should be grounded in evolved biological functions, distinguishing stable evolutionary couplings from transient technological ones. Palermos (2013) develops an epistemological framework where extended cognitive systems ground knowledge when external resources are cognitively transparent and trust-independent. Note the shift from asking "is this functionally equivalent?" to asking "is this genuinely integrated?"

**Connection to research**: Integration approaches reframe how to evaluate cognitive offloading. Rather than asking whether offloaded processes mirror internal ones (parity), they ask whether offloading involves transformative integration through practiced, skilled activity. This suggests that routine, practiced offloading (using writing systems, well-integrated tools) may constitute genuine extension, while novel or casual tool use may not.

**Section Summary**: The debate has shifted from whether external resources can be functionally equivalent to internal ones (first wave) to whether and how they can be integrated into hybrid cognitive systems (second wave). Key unresolved tensions remain: what integration criteria suffice for constitution, how to distinguish scaffolding from extension, and whether functionalist commitments support or undermine extended cognition.

## Section 2: Empirical Cognitive Offloading -- Mechanisms, Metacognition, and Individual Differences

**Section Purpose**: Survey the empirical research on cognitive offloading, focusing on what the findings reveal about the mechanisms governing externalization of cognitive processes. This section grounds the philosophical debates in measurable phenomena and identifies where empirical evidence speaks to (or complicates) questions about cognitive extension.

**Main Claims**:
1. Cognitive offloading is governed by metacognitive monitoring processes: people offload based on confidence judgments about their internal abilities, not simply in response to capacity overload, and these judgments are systematically biased.
2. Offloading is not a unitary phenomenon but varies across domains (memory, intention, spatial navigation), across individuals (working memory capacity, age, clinical conditions), and across contexts -- challenging unified philosophical accounts.

### Subsection 2.1: Metacognitive Control of Offloading

**Papers**: Risko and Dunn (2015) [Risko2015storing], Gilbert et al. (2018) [Gilbert2018optimal], Gilbert et al. (2022) [Gilbert2022outsourcing], Sachdeva and Gilbert (2020) [Sachdeva2020excessive], Scott and Gilbert (2024) [Scott2024metacognition], Boldt and Gilbert (2022) [Boldt2022partially]

**Content**: Present the metacognitive model of cognitive offloading. Risko and Dunn (2015) establish that offloading decisions in memory tasks are guided by metacognitive assessments of difficulty, with people strategically increasing reliance on external storage as memory demands grow. Gilbert et al.'s (2022) review synthesizes research on intention offloading, showing that setting reminders for delayed intentions is guided by confidence monitoring and that offloading is adaptive (Scott and Gilbert 2024 show that real-world plans are more successfully completed when lower confidence prompts greater reminder use). However, Gilbert et al. (2018) demonstrate a systematic bias: people overuse external reminders relative to the optimal strategy, driven partly by metacognitive underconfidence and partly by effort minimization (Sachdeva and Gilbert 2020). This bias is persistent but modifiable through metacognitive advice. At the neural level, Boldt and Gilbert (2022) show that metacognitive monitoring (confidence) and metacognitive control (reminder decisions) engage partially overlapping but distinguishable neural patterns in prefrontal and parietal regions.

**Connection to research**: The metacognitive architecture governing offloading raises important questions for extended cognition. If offloading is guided by internal metacognitive assessments -- requiring ongoing monitoring of the boundary between internal capacity and external support -- this suggests the relationship between agent and tool involves active management rather than seamless transparency. The persistent bias toward over-offloading complicates accounts of extended cognitive systems as optimally organized.

### Subsection 2.2: Individual Differences, Development, and the Heterogeneity of Offloading

**Papers**: Ball et al. (2021) [Ball2021individual], Meyerhoff et al. (2021) [Meyerhoff2021individual], Armitage et al. (2021) [Armitage2021young], Sun et al. (2024) [Sun2024cognitive], Sparrow et al. (2011) [Sparrow2011google], Zheng et al. (2025) [Zheng2025microstructural]

**Content**: Present evidence that offloading is modulated by individual cognitive capacities. Ball et al. (2021) show that individuals with lower working memory capacity offload more and benefit more from it, suggesting compensatory function. However, Meyerhoff et al. (2021) find that offloading behavior is task-specific rather than reflecting a domain-general trait -- people who offload heavily in one paradigm do not necessarily do so in another, even though both measures correlate with short-term memory capacity. Developmentally, Armitage et al. (2021) demonstrate that children as young as 4--5 years spontaneously devise external memory strategies, suggesting offloading is a fundamental aspect of human cognitive architecture. Sun et al. (2024) reveal that offloading biases shift with development: younger children under-offload (overconfident in their memory) while adolescents over-offload. Sparrow et al.'s (2011) "Google effect" shows how internet availability transforms memory strategies, with people encoding location information rather than content -- a macro-level shift in offloading behavior. Zheng et al. (2025) identify white-matter tract integrity (SLF, cingulum bundle) as structural correlates of optimal offloading.

**Connection to research**: The heterogeneity of offloading challenges unified philosophical accounts. If offloading is task-specific, compensatory for low-capacity individuals, and developmentally shifting, then no single philosophical model (parity, integration, scaffolding) may capture all forms of offloading. The developmental evidence that young children spontaneously create external aids suggests offloading may be an evolved feature of human cognitive architecture rather than a modern technological phenomenon -- potentially supporting the extended mind thesis by showing that humans are naturally tool-using cognitive agents.

**Section Summary**: Empirical research establishes that cognitive offloading is a metacognitively governed, individually variable, and developmentally shifting phenomenon. People actively monitor and manage the boundary between internal and external resources, often with systematic biases. This picture complicates both optimistic accounts of seamless cognitive extension and pessimistic narratives of technology-induced cognitive decline.

## Section 3: Digital Technologies as Test Cases -- Smartphones, the Internet, and the Limits of Extension

**Section Purpose**: Examine how smartphones and Internet technologies function as contemporary test cases for extended cognition, integrating philosophical analysis with empirical evidence about cognitive impacts. This section brings the theoretical debates and empirical findings into direct contact with the most practically urgent cases of cognitive offloading.

**Main Claims**:
1. Digital technologies present distinctive challenges for extended cognition theories because they combine features that support extension claims (ubiquity, information richness, personalization) with features that complicate them (attentional capture, opacity, dynamic updating, potential for manipulation).
2. Empirical evidence about the cognitive impacts of smartphones is mixed and contested, with the "brain drain" hypothesis facing replication difficulties and the "Google effect" raising questions about whether cognitive restructuring constitutes impairment or adaptation.

### Subsection 3.1: The Internet as Extended Cognitive System

**Papers**: Smart (2017) [smart2017extended], Smart, Heersmink, and Clowes (2017) [smart2017cognitive], Heersmink (2016) [heersmink2016internet], Heersmink and Sutton (2018) [heersmink2018cognition], Schwengerer (2020) [schwengerer2020online], Smart, Andrada, and Clowes (2022) [smart2022phenomenal]

**Content**: Present the philosophical case for Internet-extended cognition. Smart (2017) argues that Internet technologies can constitute part of extended cognitive systems, while introducing concerns about "network-extended cognitive bloat" when system boundaries become unclear. Smart, Heersmink, and Clowes (2017) develop a "cognitive ecology" framework treating the Internet as a transformative cognitive niche characterized by information abundance, networked social interaction, and constantly evolving knowledge structures. Heersmink and Sutton (2018) analyze web-based cognition through three frameworks (extended mind, transactive memory, scaffolding), arguing different online practices fit different frameworks. Heersmink (2016) examines how Internet use affects cognitive values -- enhancing speed and breadth while potentially undermining deeper understanding. Schwengerer (2020) argues that first-wave (parity-based) extended mind is incompatible with the online intellectual virtues needed for responsible Internet use, advocating second-wave gradient accounts. Smart, Andrada, and Clowes (2022) challenge phenomenal transparency as a criterion for extension, arguing it is neither necessary nor sufficient -- opening space for non-transparent digital tools to count as cognitive extensions.

**Connection to research**: Internet and web-based tools challenge traditional extended mind criteria developed for simpler technologies. The plurality of frameworks (extension, transactive memory, scaffolding) for analyzing web cognition suggests the question may not be whether the Internet extends cognition but which Internet practices, under which conditions, do so.

### Subsection 3.2: Smartphones, Brain Drain, and the Contested Evidence

**Papers**: Ward et al. (2017) [ward2017brain], Ruiz Pardo and Minda (2022) [ruiz2022reexamining], Bottger et al. (2023) [bottger2023does], Parry (2023) [parry2023mere], Firth et al. (2019) [firth2019online]

**Content**: Present the empirical debate about smartphone impacts on cognition. Ward et al.'s (2017) "brain drain" hypothesis claims that smartphone presence alone reduces available cognitive capacity, even when phones are turned off -- an effect attributed to attentional resources being consumed by the device's proximity. However, Ruiz Pardo and Minda (2022) failed to replicate these findings in a pre-registered direct replication. Two meta-analyses offer partially divergent assessments: Bottger et al. (2023) find a significant overall negative effect but with substantial heterogeneity, while Parry's (2023) more comprehensive analysis (56 studies) finds limited support, with only working memory showing a significant negative effect. Firth et al. (2019) review broader evidence that Internet use alters attention, memory, and social cognition, finding evidence for both acute and sustained cognitive alterations. Present the methodological concerns: heterogeneous measures, poor statistical power, context-dependent effects.

**Connection to research**: The contested empirical evidence complicates both pro-extension and anti-extension positions. If smartphones do not reliably drain cognitive resources, the concern that they function as cognitive distractors rather than extensions is weakened. But if effects are domain-specific and context-dependent, this suggests the relationship between smartphones and cognition is more complex than either seamless extension or inevitable impairment. The replication difficulties highlight how philosophical debates depend on empirical findings whose robustness is still being established.

**Section Summary**: Digital technologies present the most practically pressing test cases for extended cognition, yet both philosophical analysis and empirical evidence yield a complex picture. The Internet may extend cognition under some conditions and scaffold or impair it under others; smartphones may drain cognitive resources in some domains but not others. These findings resist simple narratives and call for domain-specific, context-sensitive analysis.

## Section 4: Critical Perspectives -- Alternative Frameworks and Unresolved Tensions

**Section Purpose**: Present the challenges that remain for the extended mind thesis and the offloading research program, including alternative philosophical frameworks (enactivism, predictive processing), methodological concerns about the empirical literature, and normative questions about cognitive autonomy.

**Main Claims**:
1. Alternative frameworks -- radical enactivism, predictive processing, and embedded cognition -- offer competing accounts of the phenomena that extended mind and offloading research address, and some of these alternatives avoid the difficulties facing both parity and integration approaches.
2. The relationship between extended cognition and cognitive offloading remains conceptually underdeveloped: offloading may be better understood as strategic niche management than as cognitive extension, and normative concerns about cognitive dependence complicate purely descriptive accounts.

### Subsection 4.1: Enactivist and Predictive Processing Alternatives

**Papers**: Hutto and Myin (2013) [hutto2013radicalizing], Di Paolo (2008) [dipaolo2008extended], Sganzerla, Hutto, and Kirchhoff (2025) [sganzerla2025beyond], Clark (2013) [clark2013whatever], Hohwy (2016) [hohwy2016predictive], Fabry (2017) [fabry2017transcending], Britten-Neish (2025) [brittenNeish2025cognitive]

**Content**: Present radical enactivism (Hutto and Myin 2013) as challenging the entire framing of the extended mind debate: if basic cognition involves no representational content, then both internalism and extended mind are arguing about the wrong thing -- the location of content that does not exist. Di Paolo (2008) offers the enactivist view that extended mind does not go far enough in breaking with cognitivist assumptions. Sganzerla, Hutto, and Kirchhoff (2025) develop extensive enactivism as an alternative emphasizing sensorimotor engagement over information processing. Present the predictive processing debate: Clark (2013) argues that prediction error minimization naturally supports extended mind through active inference, while Hohwy (2016) argues that the evidentiary boundary at sensory surfaces creates principled cognitive boundaries, making predictive processing internalist. Fabry (2017) mediates, arguing for explanatory pluralism where different phenomena require different boundary placements. Include Britten-Neish's (2025) argument that the extended mind debate requires an Anscombean action theory, showing how assumptions about agency shape interpretation of offloading evidence.

**Connection to research**: These alternatives suggest that the offloading literature may be asking the wrong question. Rather than "does offloading extend cognition?", enactivists would ask "how does offloading transform sense-making?"; predictive processing theorists would ask "how does offloading modulate prediction error minimization?"; and action theorists would ask "how does offloading manifest agency's environmental dependence?" Each reframing yields different empirical predictions and normative implications.

### Subsection 4.2: Methodological Concerns and the Question of Cognitive Autonomy

**Papers**: De Brigard (2017) [brigard2017cognitive], Bukow (2013) [bukow2013use], Hutchins (2010) [hutchins2010cognitive], Padalko (2025) [padalko2025cognitive], Andrada, Clowes, and Smart (2022) [andrada2022varieties], Chiriatti et al. (2025) [chiriatti2025system]

**Content**: Present methodological concerns. De Brigard (2017) raises the dynamic boundary problem: if cognitive systems are individuated by coupling relations, boundaries constantly shift, making extended systems scientifically intractable. Bukow (2013) argues that 4E approaches lack principled stopping criteria for determining system boundaries, making individuation arbitrary. Hutchins (2010) proposes cognitive ecology as an alternative that sidesteps individuation problems by studying how cognitive ecosystems are assembled rather than where cognitive boundaries lie. Turn to normative concerns: Padalko (2025) argues that IoT environments reduce cognitive autonomy through algorithmic mediation and platform dependency. Andrada, Clowes, and Smart (2022) examine how AI system opacity affects cognitive agency. Chiriatti et al. (2025) propose a "System 0" framework for AI as cognitive extension while identifying the paradox that AI may simultaneously expand and constrain thinking. These concerns suggest that even if cognitive extension is philosophically coherent, widespread offloading to digital and AI systems may raise distinct normative questions about autonomy and cognitive self-determination.

**Connection to research**: The methodological and normative concerns suggest limits on what extended cognition claims can establish. Even if philosophical arguments favor some form of cognitive extension, the difficulty of operationalizing these claims empirically, combined with normative concerns about cognitive dependence, means that the practical significance of the debate remains contested.

**Section Summary**: The extended mind thesis faces challenges not only from internalist critics but from alternative frameworks that reconceptualize the phenomena, methodological concerns about empirical tractability, and normative worries about cognitive autonomy. These challenges do not necessarily defeat the extended mind thesis but highlight that the question of cognitive extension is more complex than the original parity formulation suggested.

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the state of the literature and position the research project within existing debates, identifying key gaps and unresolved questions.

**Content**:
- Summarize the trajectory from Clark and Chalmers' original thesis through the coupling-constitution debate to integration-based approaches: the field has moved from asking whether minds extend to asking how, when, and under what conditions cognitive extension occurs.
- Note the disconnect between philosophical theorizing and empirical offloading research. Philosophical debates center on thought experiments and conceptual analysis, while empirical research focuses on metacognitive mechanisms and behavioral measures. Integration approaches (Menary, Kirchhoff) offer the most promising bridge, but the connection remains underdeveloped.
- Identify key unresolved tensions: (a) whether offloading constitutes extension or merely scaffolding -- Sterelny's distinction remains underexplored empirically; (b) whether integration criteria can be operationalized for empirical testing; (c) whether the metacognitive management revealed by offloading research supports or undermines claims about seamless cognitive extension; (d) how to evaluate the normative implications of widespread offloading to AI systems.
- Position the research project: the intersection of extended mind theory and cognitive offloading research is where philosophical questions about cognitive boundaries meet empirical evidence about how people actually use external resources. Studying this intersection can yield both better philosophical theories (informed by behavioral and neural data) and better empirical research programs (informed by conceptual distinctions about constitution vs. causation, integration vs. scaffolding).
- Expected contributions: clarifying how different philosophical frameworks (parity, integration, enactivism, predictive processing) generate different predictions about offloading behavior; identifying criteria for when offloading constitutes genuine cognitive extension versus instrumental tool use; and evaluating the normative implications of digital cognitive dependence.
