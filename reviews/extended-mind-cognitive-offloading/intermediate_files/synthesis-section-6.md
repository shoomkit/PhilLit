## Conclusion

The trajectory from Clark and Chalmers' original extended mind thesis to contemporary cognitive offloading research reveals a field that has moved from asking whether minds extend beyond the brain to asking how, when, and under what conditions cognitive extension occurs. The debate's evolution reflects growing sophistication about the mechanisms and criteria for cognitive extension, but also reveals persistent tensions between philosophical theorizing and empirical research.

Philosophically, the extended mind debate has progressed through distinct phases. The first wave, grounded in the parity principle, argued that external resources count as cognitive when they play the same functional role as internal processes (Clark and Chalmers 1998). This approach faced substantial criticism: Adams and Aizawa's (2001) coupling-constitution challenge questioned whether functional equivalence establishes cognitive constitution, while Rupert's (2004, 2009) systems-based critique argued that cognitive systems should be individuated by persistent causal integration rather than transient functional similarity. The second wave responded with integration-based approaches that emphasize complementarity over parity (Menary 2006, 2013; Greif 2015). These frameworks argue that external resources extend cognition not by replicating internal processes but by contributing distinct, complementary capacities that transform cognitive possibilities through practiced integration. Sterelny's (2010) scaffolding alternative offers a middle path, acknowledging environmental dependence while questioning whether support relations constitute cognitive extension.

The empirical cognitive offloading literature has developed largely independently, establishing that offloading decisions are governed by metacognitive monitoring processes rather than simple capacity limits (Risko and Dunn 2015; Gilbert et al. 2022). People offload based on confidence judgments about their internal abilities, yet show systematic biases toward overusing external aids (Gilbert et al. 2018; Sachdeva and Gilbert 2020). Individual differences research reveals that offloading is modulated by working memory capacity (Ball et al. 2021), varies across task contexts (Meyerhoff et al. 2021), and shifts developmentally—with young children under-offloading due to overconfidence and adolescents over-offloading (Sun et al. 2024). Neuroscientific findings identify prefrontal-parietal networks supporting metacognitive control of offloading, with distinct but overlapping patterns for monitoring and control processes (Boldt and Gilbert 2022; Zheng et al. 2025).

Digital technologies—smartphones, the Internet, AI systems—present contemporary test cases where philosophical and empirical questions converge. Internet-based offloading has generated competing interpretations: Smart (2017) and Heersmink and Sutton (2018) analyze web cognition through multiple frameworks (extended mind, transactive memory, scaffolding), acknowledging that different online practices may fit different frameworks. Empirical evidence about smartphone impacts remains contested, with Ward et al.'s (2017) "brain drain" hypothesis facing replication difficulties (Ruiz Pardo and Minda 2022) and meta-analytic results showing heterogeneous effects (Bottger et al. 2023; Parry 2023). The Google effect (Sparrow et al. 2011) demonstrates that internet availability alters what information is encoded, shifting memory strategies from content storage to location tracking.

Yet the connection between philosophical theorizing and empirical offloading research remains underdeveloped. Philosophical debates center on conceptual distinctions between constitution and causation, analyzing thought experiments like Otto's notebook. Empirical research focuses on measurable offloading behaviors and their metacognitive determinants, typically without explicit engagement with extended mind frameworks. Integration approaches offer the most promising bridge: Menary's emphasis on cognitive practices and Kirchhoff's mutual manipulability criterion provide frameworks that could be operationalized empirically. But systematic attempts to test whether specific offloading behaviors meet integration criteria remain scarce.

Several key tensions persist. First, the scaffolding-extension distinction: Does the metacognitive management revealed by offloading research—where agents actively monitor and control the boundary between internal and external resources—support or undermine claims about seamless cognitive extension? The finding that offloading requires ongoing metacognitive assessment suggests external resources are not transparently integrated but actively managed, potentially favoring scaffolding over extension accounts. Second, the heterogeneity problem: If offloading strategies are task-specific rather than domain-general (Meyerhoff et al. 2021), and if individual differences are substantial, can any unified philosophical account capture all forms of cognitive offloading? Third, the normative dimension: Contemporary concerns about cognitive autonomy in AI-mediated environments (Padalko 2025; Andrada, Clowes, and Smart 2022; Chiriatti et al. 2025) complicate purely descriptive extended mind claims. Even if philosophical arguments support cognitive extension, the algorithmic mediation and opacity of digital cognitive tools raise distinct questions about cognitive self-determination.

Alternative frameworks challenge whether extended mind provides the best conceptual tools for understanding offloading phenomena. Radical enactivism (Hutto and Myin 2013) rejects the representational assumptions underlying both internalist and extended mind positions, suggesting that much offloading may involve sensorimotor reconfiguration rather than redistribution of representational content. Predictive processing offers competing interpretations: Clark (2013) argues that prediction error minimization naturally extends across brain-environment boundaries, while Hohwy (2016) contends that evidentiary boundaries at sensory surfaces create principled cognitive limits. Hutchins' (2010) cognitive ecology framework sidesteps individuation questions entirely, focusing on how cognitive ecosystems are assembled rather than where cognitive boundaries lie.

Methodologically, both philosophical and empirical work face challenges. De Brigard's (2017) dynamic boundary problem highlights that if cognitive systems are individuated by coupling relations, system boundaries constantly shift, making extended systems scientifically intractable. Bukow's (2013) critique shows that 4E approaches lack principled stop-criteria for determining what counts as part of cognitive systems, creating arbitrariness in how offloading studies operationalize cognitive extension. These concerns suggest that even if extended mind is conceptually coherent, translating it into testable empirical predictions remains difficult.

The research project at the intersection of extended mind theory and cognitive offloading research addresses where philosophical questions about cognitive boundaries meet empirical evidence about how people actually use external resources. Studying this intersection can yield better philosophical theories—informed by behavioral and neural data about metacognitive mechanisms, individual differences, and developmental trajectories—and better empirical research programs—informed by conceptual distinctions between constitution and causation, integration and scaffolding, parity and complementarity. Key contributions might include: clarifying how different philosophical frameworks generate different predictions about offloading behavior; identifying operationalizable criteria for when offloading constitutes genuine cognitive extension versus instrumental tool use; and evaluating the normative implications of digital cognitive dependence in light of both empirical findings about costs and benefits and philosophical arguments about cognitive autonomy. The field has established that cognitive offloading is a pervasive, metacognitively governed, and individually variable phenomenon. Whether it also constitutes genuine cognitive extension remains the central unresolved question.
