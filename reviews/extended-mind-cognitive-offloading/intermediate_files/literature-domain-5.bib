DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Empirical research on cognitive offloading examines how humans strategically externalize cognitive processes to reduce internal cognitive demands. This research tradition emerged from distributed cognition frameworks but focuses on measurable behavioral outcomes and mechanisms. Key research strands include: (1) intention offloading, where individuals use external reminders (alarms, notes) to support prospective memory; (2) memory offloading more broadly, including the "Google effect" showing reliance on internet search for factual knowledge; (3) transactive memory systems where cognitive labor is distributed across social partners; (4) spatial offloading, particularly GPS dependence and its effects on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory; and (5) metacognitive control of offloading decisions. Recent work establishes that offloading decisions are guided by metacognitive monitoring (confidence judgments about internal memory), effort minimization, and individual differences in cognitive capacity. Neuroscientific studies have begun identifying neural correlates of metacognitive monitoring versus control in offloading contexts. A consistent finding across paradigms is that people often overuse external aids relative to optimal performance (a "cognitive offloading bias"), driven partly by underconfidence in internal memory and partly by effort avoidance.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the empirical grounding for philosophical debates about extended cognition and cognitive integration. The metacognitive mechanisms governing offloading decisions directly inform questions about when external resources become genuinely cognitive versus merely instrumental. The literature on costs and benefits of offloading (e.g., memory consolidation effects, skill atrophy with GPS use) bears on normative questions about cognitive autonomy and deskilling. Individual differences research challenges unified philosophical accounts by showing offloading is modulated by working memory capacity, age, and clinical conditions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited research on offloading in higher-order cognitive tasks (reasoning, moral judgment) compared to memory and navigation. Few studies directly compare offloading strategies across different external tools (paper notes vs. digital reminders). Neural mechanisms remain underspecified, particularly for how metacognitive signals translate into offloading actions. Four entries (Risko2015storing, Sachdeva2020excessive, Iley2024childrens, Cherkaoui2017strategic) are marked INCOMPLETE due to unavailable abstracts but are retained for reference manager import.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around offloading types (memory, intention, spatial) while emphasizing cross-cutting themes of metacognition and individual differences. Highlight empirical evidence for both adaptive and maladaptive offloading patterns. Connect findings on neural mechanisms (prefrontal-parietal networks) to philosophical accounts of cognitive boundaries.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper introduces a novel paradigm where participants choose between using internal memory versus external information storage (dragging stimuli to visible locations) in a short-term memory task. Results show that participants strategically offload information based on metacognitive assessments of memory difficulty, with greater offloading when memory set sizes are larger. However, participants show systematic biases, sometimes overusing external storage even when internal memory would be more efficient.

  RELEVANCE: This is a foundational paper establishing the cognitive offloading paradigm for memory research. It directly demonstrates that offloading decisions are metacognitively guided, which is crucial for understanding whether external resources function as genuine cognitive extensions (requiring appropriate metacognitive integration) or merely compensatory tools. The finding of offloading biases raises questions about the optimality and rationality of extended cognitive systems.

  POSITION: Establishes the metacognitive control framework for understanding offloading decisions in memory tasks, showing offloading is neither purely reactive to capacity limits nor perfectly rational.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review synthesizes research on intention offloading—the use of external reminders to support delayed intentions (prospective memory). The review establishes that offloading is highly effective for improving performance, systematically guided by metacognitive beliefs about memory ability, and shows stable individual differences over time. Crucially, offloading decisions are influenced by both accuracy of metacognitive monitoring and biases toward effort minimization, leading to systematic over-reliance on reminders.

  RELEVANCE: This review article provides an authoritative overview of the most developed strand of cognitive offloading research. It demonstrates that offloading involves sophisticated metacognitive control processes, not merely passive tool use, which supports accounts of extended cognition that emphasize integration mechanisms. The documented individual differences and developmental changes challenge unified philosophical theories and suggest offloading strategies are heterogeneous across populations.

  POSITION: Synthesizes the metacognitive model of intention offloading while documenting systematic biases and individual differences that complicate idealized models of optimal cognitive tool use.

  abstract = {How do we remember delayed intentions? Three decades of research into prospective memory have provided insight into the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in this form of memory. However, we depend on more than just our brains to remember intentions. We also use external props and tools such as calendars and diaries, strategically placed objects, and technologies such as smartphone alerts. This is known as ‘intention offloading’. Despite the progress in our understanding of brain-based prospective memory, we know much less about the role of intention offloading in individuals’ ability to fulfil delayed intentions. Here, we review recent research into intention offloading, with a particular focus on how individuals decide between storing intentions in internal memory versus external reminders. We also review studies investigating how intention offloading changes across the lifespan and how it relates to underlying brain mechanisms. We conclude that intention offloading is highly effective, experimentally tractable, and guided by metacognitive processes. Individuals have systematic biases in their offloading strategies that are stable over time. Evidence also suggests that individual differences and developmental changes in offloading strategies are driven at least in part by metacognitive processes. Therefore, metacognitive interventions could play an important role in promoting individuals’ adaptive use of cognitive tools.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper demonstrates that individuals show systematic biases toward using external reminders even when financially incentivized to choose optimally between internal memory and reminders. The bias is predicted by metacognitive underconfidence—participants underestimate their memory abilities. Crucially, the bias can be eliminated through metacognitive advice (informing participants which strategy maximizes performance) and is mediated by shifts in confidence through feedback manipulation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides strong experimental evidence that offloading is guided by metacognitive evaluations rather than actual cognitive capacity. The finding that metacognitive interventions can shift offloading behavior is critical for normative debates about cognitive autonomy—it suggests people can be trained to use external resources more optimally. The persistent bias toward overuse challenges philosophical views that treat extended systems as inherently rational or well-calibrated.

  POSITION: Establishes that metacognitive error (underconfidence) drives systematic overuse of external cognitive aids, but demonstrates this bias is modifiable through metacognitive training.

  abstract = {Individuals frequently choose between accomplishing goals using unaided cognitive abilities or offloading cognitive demands onto external tools and resources. For example, in order to remember an upcoming appointment one might rely on unaided memory or create a reminder by setting a smartphone alert. Setting a reminder incurs both a cost (the time/effort to set it up) and a benefit (increased likelihood of remembering). Here we investigate whether individuals weigh such costs/benefits optimally or show systematic biases. In 3 experiments, participants performed a memory task where they could choose between (a) earning a maximum reward for each remembered item, using unaided memory; or (b) earning a lesser amount per item, using external reminders to increase the number remembered. Participants were significantly biased toward using external reminders, even when they had a financial incentive to choose optimally. Individual differences in this bias were stable over time, and predicted by participants' erroneous metacognitive underconfidence in their memory abilities. Bias was eliminated, however, when participants received metacognitive advice about which strategy was likely to maximize performance. Furthermore, we found that metacognitive interventions (manipulation of feedback valence and practice-trial difficulty) yielded shifts in participants' reminder bias that were mediated by shifts in confidence. However, the bias could not be fully attributed to metacognitive error. We conclude that individuals have stable biases toward using external versus internal cognitive resources, which result at least in part from inaccurate metacognitive evaluations. Finding interventions to mitigate these biases can improve individuals' adaptive use of cognitive tools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This widely cited paper demonstrates that when people expect information to be available online, they show reduced memory for the information itself but enhanced memory for where to access it (transactive memory for internet sources). Experiments show that difficult questions automatically prime concepts related to computers/internet, and that saving information externally reduces subsequent recall. The authors argue the internet has become a primary transactive memory partner, fundamentally altering memory strategies.

  RELEVANCE: This paper introduced the "Google effect" concept and sparked widespread debate about technology's impact on memory. It provides direct empirical evidence that offloading to digital sources alters what information is encoded, which is central to philosophical debates about whether internet-dependent cognition constitutes genuine cognitive extension or represents cognitive decline. The transactive memory framework links individual and extended cognition.

  POSITION: Argues that internet offloading represents a form of transactive memory adaptation where people optimize for knowing where information is located rather than retaining content, suggesting functional reorganization rather than simple impairment.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis during an intention offloading task, this paper demonstrates that metacognitive monitoring (confidence judgments) and metacognitive control (reminder-setting decisions) have partially overlapping but distinguishable neural patterns. Both processes engage prefrontal and parietal regions, but they can be decoded separately and show limited cross-classification, suggesting distinct computational mechanisms despite shared neural architecture.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the first studies to identify neural substrates of cognitive offloading and the metacognitive processes that guide it. The partial overlap between monitoring and control mechanisms has implications for philosophical debates about cognitive integration—if offloading control depends on dissociable neural mechanisms from confidence monitoring, this may indicate that using external tools involves additional cognitive operations beyond simple capacity assessments. The neural evidence grounds abstract philosophical discussions in concrete brain mechanisms.

  POSITION: Provides neuroscientific evidence for dual-process models of offloading where metacognitive monitoring and control involve related but distinct computational and neural mechanisms.

  abstract = {Metacognition describes the process of monitoring one's own mental states, often for the purpose of cognitive control. Previous research has investigated how metacognitive signals are generated (metacognitive monitoring), for example, when people (both female/male) judge their confidence in their decisions and memories. Research has also investigated how metacognitive signals are used to influence behavior (metacognitive control), for example, setting a reminder (i.e., cognitive offloading) for something you are not confident you will remember. However, the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control needs further study on a neural level. We used fMRI to investigate a delayed-intentions task with a reminder element, allowing human participants to use their metacognitive insight to engage metacognitive control. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that we could separately decode both monitoring and control, and, to a lesser extent, cross-classify between them. Therefore, brain patterns associated with monitoring and control are partially, but not fully, overlapping. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Models of metacognition commonly distinguish between monitoring (how metacognition is formed) and control (how metacognition is used for behavioral regulation). Research into these facets of metacognition has often happened in isolation. Here, we provide a study which directly investigates the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control at a neural level. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data from a novel task in which participants separately rated their confidence (metacognitive monitoring) and how much they would like to use a reminder (metacognitive control). We find support for the notion that the two aspects of metacognition overlap partially but not fully. We argue that future research should focus on how different metacognitive signals are selected for control.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.concog.2020.103024},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper investigates why individuals often set reminders excessively, even for easy-to-remember intentions. Results show that excessive reminder use is driven by two factors: metacognitive underconfidence about memory abilities and effort minimization (cognitive laziness). Importantly, the study demonstrates that even when reminders require effort to set up, participants still overuse them, suggesting the bias toward offloading is robust.

  RELEVANCE: The finding of excessive offloading driven by effort minimization raises normative questions about cognitive autonomy and reliance on external aids. If people offload not because they need to but because it requires less cognitive effort, this challenges views that extended cognitive systems are adaptively optimized. The paper provides empirical evidence for concerns about technology-induced cognitive deskilling—people may offload because it's easier, not because it's necessary.

  POSITION: Argues that offloading decisions reflect a tradeoff between metacognitive accuracy and effort minimization, with effort avoidance sometimes dominating even when internal resources would be sufficient.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study extends laboratory findings on intention offloading to real-world contexts by surveying participants about their actual plans and reminder use. Results show that participants set reminders for plans they are less confident they will remember and judge to be more important. Crucially, lower confidence predicted greater reminder use, which in turn predicted higher fulfillment rates—demonstrating an adaptive metacognitive strategy where underconfidence leads to compensatory offloading and ultimately better real-world outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides critical ecological validity for laboratory findings on metacognitive control of offloading. The fact that lower confidence predicts greater success (via reminder use) in real-world contexts demonstrates that offloading can be an adaptive metacognitive strategy, not merely a bias or failure. This complicates normative philosophical debates—offloading may represent sophisticated self-regulation rather than cognitive decline. The real-world context is essential for evaluating extended cognition theories.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that metacognitive guidance of offloading operates adaptively in naturalistic settings, with underconfidence driving compensatory reminder use that improves real-world performance.

  abstract = {Reminders such as calendar entries and digital alerts are highly effective at helping people remember what they need to do. Recent work has explored the triggers of reminder setting, also known as intention offloading, finding that low confidence is associated with more offloading in laboratory tasks. This supports a metacognitive model of cognitive offloading. Here, we investigated whether this model generalizes to real-world intentions. We asked 112 participants about their upcoming plans and subsequent fulfillment of those plans in two online surveys conducted in 2022. Participants were more likely to set reminders for plans that (a) they were less confident they would remember and (b) they judged to be more important. Participants with lower confidence that they would remember to return for the second survey were more likely to set a reminder for this plan. This, in turn, predicted greater fulfillment. Therefore, ironically, lower confidence predicted greater success. These findings show that intention offloading predicts fulfillment of real-world intentions. They also point toward metacognition as a target for interventions to facilitate this. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This large-scale study (N=268) demonstrates that working memory capacity modulates offloading strategies and their effectiveness. Individuals with higher working memory capacity showed better performance when relying on internal memory, but this advantage was eliminated when reminders were available. Crucially, individuals with lower working memory capacity chose to offload more frequently and benefited more from offloading, suggesting adaptive calibration of offloading strategies to internal cognitive capacities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides strong evidence that offloading is not a uniform phenomenon but varies systematically with individual cognitive capacities. The finding that lower-capacity individuals benefit more from offloading suggests external resources can genuinely compensate for internal limitations, supporting functional accounts of extended cognition. However, it also raises questions about whether offloading strategies are stable traits or context-dependent adaptations, relevant to debates about the constitutive versus instrumental role of external resources.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that offloading effectiveness and preference are modulated by working memory capacity, suggesting offloading serves compensatory functions for individuals with lower internal cognitive resources.

The current study examined whether the ability to offload intentions onto the environment mitigated these deficits. Participants (N = 268) completed three versions of a delayed intention task with and without the use of reminders, along with three measures of working memory capacity. Results showed that individuals with higher working memory fulfilled more intentions when having to rely on their own memory, but this difference was eliminated when offloading was permitted. Individuals with lower working memory chose to offload more often, suggesting that they were less willing to engage in effortful maintenance of internal representations when given the option. Working memory was not associated with metacognitive confidence or optimal offloading choices based on point value. These findings suggest offloading may help circumvent capacity limitations associated with maintaining and remembering delayed intentions.},

The study also suggests individual differences in offloading may have structural neural bases.

Behaviorally, we replicated prior findings showing that under-confidence in internal memory predicts a bias toward using external reminders. At the neural level, we used diffusion tensor imaging to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of microstructural integrity in white matter. We found the microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle (CB) negatively predicted deviations from the optimal use of reminders. The microstructural integrity of the fornix negatively predicted participants’ confidence in performing the task when restricted to internal memory. Our findings reveal the microstructural organization of these fronto-temporal-parietal white-matter tracts are related to metacognition driven cognitive offloading.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study investigates time-based intention offloading (setting reminders for actions at specific times) while participants perform a concurrent working memory task. Offloading increased with longer delays and was reduced when a clock was continuously visible. Crucially, offloading was driven by metacognitive beliefs about the need for reminders rather than actual memory performance, and reminder use significantly improved accuracy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends offloading research to time-based prospective memory, showing that similar metacognitive principles apply across different offloading contexts. The finding that cue visibility (clock availability) modulates offloading suggests the decision involves weighing multiple environmental factors, not just internal capacity. This is relevant to philosophical debates about situatedness and the role of environmental structure in shaping cognitive strategies.

In everyday life, people often offload these demands to the external environment by setting alerts and reminders; however, this process of time-based intention offloading has rarely been examined experimentally. Here, we investigated this process in a paradigm where participants had to remember to press a key after a 10, 20, or 30 s delay, while simultaneously engaged in an ongoing two-back working memory task. Use of reminders improved accuracy, and participants were more likely to offload intentions at longer delays. This process was driven at least partially by metacognitive beliefs about the need for reminders, rather than the actual need. There was also an influence of time-monitoring demands: offloading was reduced when a clock was always visible, compared with a condition where participants had to press a button to reveal it. These results show that principles of cognitive offloading established in other domains also apply to time-based prospective memory: it improves performance, is influenced by cognitive demand, and guided by metacognitive beliefs.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study examines whether offloading behavior reflects a domain-general trait by comparing individual differences across two offloading paradigms (intention offloading and pattern copy tasks) and short-term memory capacity. Despite high test-retest reliability for offloading within each task, offloading behavior was uncorrelated between the two tasks. However, both offloading measures correlated with short-term memory capacity, suggesting task-specific offloading strategies that nonetheless respond to general cognitive limitations.

  RELEVANCE: This finding challenges unified theoretical accounts of cognitive offloading by showing that offloading is not a single stable trait but varies across task contexts. This has implications for philosophical theories of extended cognition—if offloading strategies are task-specific rather than domain-general, this suggests multiple distinct mechanisms rather than a unified "extended mind" process. The correlation with memory capacity supports compensatory models where offloading responds to internal limitations.

  abstract = {The cognitive load of many everyday life tasks exceeds known limitations of short-term memory. One strategy to compensate for information overload is cognitive offloading which refers to the externalization of cognitive processes such as reminder setting instead of memorizing. There appears to be remarkable variance in offloading behavior between participants which poses the question whether there is a common factor influencing offloading behavior across different tasks tackling short-term memory processes. To pursue this question, we studied individual differences in offloading behavior between two well-established offloading paradigms: the intention offloading task which tackles memory for intentions and the pattern copy task which tackles continuous short-term memory load. Our study also included an unrelated task measuring short-term memory capacity. Each participant completed all tasks twice on two consecutive days in order to obtain reliability scores. Despite high reliability scores, individual differences in offloading behavior were uncorrelated between the two offloading tasks. In both tasks, however, individual differences in offloading behavior were correlated with the individual differences in an unrelated short-term memory task. Our results therefore show that offloading behavior cannot simply be explained in terms of a single common factor driving offloading behavior across tasks. We discuss the implications of this finding for future research investigating the interrelations of offloading behavior across different tasks.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This developmental study demonstrates that 4- and 5-year-old children can spontaneously devise external memory strategies (placing markers on containers to remember target locations) without explicit instruction. Three-year-olds could use the strategy when demonstrated but did not spontaneously generate it. This suggests that the metacognitive capacity to recognize future uncertainty and proactively create external aids emerges between ages 3-4.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides developmental evidence for the emergence of metacognitive control of offloading, showing that even young children can recognize when external aids are necessary and devise appropriate strategies. This speaks to nativist versus constructivist debates about extended cognition—if offloading strategies emerge spontaneously in early childhood, this suggests they may be a fundamental aspect of human cognitive architecture rather than a cultural or technological artifact. The developmental trajectory informs debates about cognitive maturation and tool use.

Despite possessing basic metacognitive capacities, however, preschool-aged children often fail to offload effectively. Here, we introduced 3- to 5-year-olds to a novel search task in which they were unlikely to perform optimally across trials without setting external reminders about the location of a target. Children watched as an experimenter first hid a target in one of three identical opaque containers. The containers were then shuffled out of view before children had to guess where the target was hidden. In the test phase, children could perform perfectly by simply placing a marker in a transparent jar attached to the target container prior to shuffling, and then later selecting the marked container. Children of all ages used this strategy above chance levels if they had seen it demonstrated to them, but only the 4- and 5-year-olds independently devised this external strategy to improve their future performance. These results suggest that, when necessary for optimal performance, even 4- and 5-year-olds can use metacognitive knowledge about their own future uncertainty to deploy effective external solutions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study examines how children (ages 6-12) use external aids in an immediate memory task and whether their offloading decisions are metacognitively guided. Results show that older children offload more strategically than younger children, with offloading decisions increasingly aligned with task difficulty. Metacognitive monitoring accuracy improves with age, suggesting developmental improvements in calibrating offloading to actual memory demands.

  RELEVANCE: This developmental study shows that metacognitive control of offloading improves across childhood, providing evidence that appropriate use of external cognitive resources requires metacognitive development. This has implications for educational contexts and philosophical debates about cognitive maturity—children's reliance on external aids may reflect not just technological availability but also developing metacognitive abilities to assess when offloading is beneficial.

  POSITION: Demonstrates developmental improvements in metacognitive control of offloading across childhood, with older children showing better calibration between offloading decisions and actual memory demands.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study examines offloading bias across ages 7-15, finding that primary school students tend to under-rely on external aids (overusing internal memory) while secondary students tend to over-rely on external aids. The cognitive offloading bias in primary students was specifically linked to inaccurate metacognitive monitoring—they overestimated their memory abilities. This suggests the direction of offloading bias shifts developmentally and is driven by metacognitive calibration.

  RELEVANCE: This paper reveals that offloading biases are not unidirectional—different age groups show opposite biases (under-offloading vs. over-offloading). This complicates philosophical concerns about technology dependence, suggesting that appropriate offloading requires developmental calibration and is not simply a matter of tool availability. The link to metacognitive accuracy provides a mechanistic explanation for why offloading strategies change across development.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that the direction of offloading bias (under- vs. over-reliance on external aids) varies developmentally and is linked to metacognitive monitoring accuracy.

  abstract = {Individuals often use external aids to assist with information storage, a process known as cognitive offloading. Prior research has indicated that adults sometimes fail to utilize internal and external cognitive resources judiciously, resulting in cognitive offloading bias, which is often linked to metacognition. However, it remains experimentally unverified whether primary and secondary school students exhibit cognitive offloading bias and how this relates to metacognition. This study aimed to address these gaps. In Experiment 1, we examined cognitive offloading bias in primary and secondary school students (aged 7-15 years) using a word-pair memory task. The results revealed that primary school students tended to rely excessively on internal memory in comparison to the optimal strategy, while secondary school students leaned towards an overreliance on external reminders. In Experiment 2, we incorporated metacognitive judgements to explore the relationship between metacognition and cognitive offloading bias. Results indicated that the cognitive offloading bias observed in primary school students was linked to the accuracy of their metacognitive monitoring.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study investigates whether individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) show different intention offloading patterns. Despite having objective prospective memory difficulties, individuals with ASC did not set more reminders than neurotypical controls, suggesting they do not spontaneously compensate for memory impairments through increased offloading. This indicates that metacognitive awareness of memory difficulties does not automatically lead to adaptive compensatory strategies.

  RELEVANCE: This clinical study demonstrates that offloading strategies can be dissociated from objective memory ability—individuals with ASC show memory impairments but do not increase offloading accordingly. This challenges simple compensatory models of offloading and suggests that using external aids appropriately requires intact metacognitive awareness and strategic control. The findings are relevant to philosophical debates about cognitive disability and the role of external supports.

  POSITION: Shows that individuals with ASC do not spontaneously increase offloading to compensate for memory difficulties, suggesting metacognitive awareness is necessary for adaptive offloading strategies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This large online study (N=600) examines how transdiagnostic compulsivity relates to offloading behavior. Compulsive individuals showed reduced preference for external reminders, partially but not fully explained by relative overconfidence in their memory abilities. Unlike previous studies, compulsive individuals still used metacognition to guide offloading decisions normally, suggesting the reduced offloading reflects a different mechanism than impaired metacognitive control.

  RELEVANCE: This study shows that clinical traits (compulsivity) systematically modulate offloading preferences in ways not fully explained by metacognition, suggesting additional motivational or affective factors influence offloading decisions. The reduced offloading in compulsive individuals implies they may be at risk for inadequate external memory support, which has implications for clinical interventions and normative questions about optimal offloading levels.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that transdiagnostic compulsivity reduces offloading preference beyond what metacognitive confidence alone would predict, suggesting multiple mechanisms influence offloading decisions.

  abstract = {In the current study, we explored the behavioural and cognitive correlates of the transdiagnostic trait ‘compulsive behaviour and intrusive thought’ (CIT) in humans. CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600), we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study manipulates the physical effort required to set reminders (easy vs. effortful button presses) across different memory loads. Results show that increased physical effort reduces reminder-setting at all memory loads, with the greatest effect at intermediate loads where participants are most uncertain about strategy choice. Participants with lower confidence in memory abilities set more reminders overall, but physical effort had similar effects across confidence levels.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that the costs of offloading (here physical effort) directly influence strategic decisions about cognitive tool use, not just the benefits. This is relevant to philosophical debates about the seamlessness of extended cognition—if physical effort to access external resources significantly modulates usage, this suggests external tools are not transparently integrated but require explicit cost-benefit calculation. The finding informs normative debates about interface design and cognitive accessibility.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that physical costs of offloading (effort to set reminders) significantly influence strategic offloading decisions, suggesting offloading involves explicit cost-benefit tradeoffs rather than seamless integration.

  abstract = {Intention offloading involves using external reminders such as diaries, to-do lists, and digital alerts to help us remember delayed intentions. Recent studies have provided evidence for various cognitive and metacognitive factors that guide intention offloading, but little research has investigated the physical cost of reminder-setting itself. Here, we present two pre-registered experiments investigating how the cost of physical effort associated with reminder-setting influences strategic intention offloading under different levels of memory load. At all memory loads, reminder-setting was reduced when it was more effortful. The ability to set reminders allowed participants to compensate for the influence of memory load on accuracy in the low-effort condition; this effect was attenuated in the high-effort condition. In addition, there was evidence that participants with less confidence in their memory abilities were more likely to set reminders. Contrary to prediction, physical effort had the greatest effect on reminder-setting at intermediate memory loads. We speculate that the physical costs of reminder-setting might have the greatest impact when participants are uncertain about their strategy choice. These results demonstrate the importance of physical effort as one of the factors relevant to cost-benefit decision-making about cognitive offloading strategies.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study investigates whether offloading is guided by domain-general metacognitive confidence (measured in perceptual tasks) or task-specific confidence (in the memory task itself). Results show that domain-general perceptual confidence correlates with overall offloading frequency but not with bias toward optimal offloading. This suggests offloading is influenced by both stable metacognitive traits and task-specific metacognitive assessments.

  RELEVANCE: The finding that both domain-general and task-specific metacognitive signals influence offloading suggests multiple levels of metacognitive control. This has implications for philosophical accounts of metacognition in extended cognition—if offloading decisions draw on general metacognitive traits beyond task-specific monitoring, this suggests a more complex architecture than simple feedback-based control. It also informs debates about transfer of offloading strategies across contexts.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that offloading is influenced by both domain-general metacognitive confidence traits and task-specific metacognitive assessments, suggesting multi-level metacognitive control.

  abstract = {Intention offloading refers to the use of external reminders to help remember delayed intentions (e.g., setting an alert to help you remember when you need to take your medication). Research has found that metacognitive processes influence offloading such that individual differences in confidence predict individual differences in offloading regardless of objective cognitive ability. The current study investigated the cross-domain organization of this relationship. Participants performed two perceptual discrimination tasks where objective accuracy was equalized using a staircase procedure. In a memory task, two measures of intention offloading were collected, (1) the overall likelihood of setting reminders, and (2) the bias in reminder-setting compared to the optimal strategy. It was found that perceptual confidence was associated with the first measure but not the second. It is shown that this is because individual differences in perceptual confidence capture meaningful differences in objective ability despite the staircase procedure. These findings indicate that intention offloading is influenced by both domain-general and task-specific metacognitive signals. They also show that even when task performance is equalized via staircasing, individual differences in confidence cannot be considered a pure measure of metacognitive bias.},
