DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The coupling-constitution debate represents a central challenge to the extended mind thesis. Critics, particularly Adams and Aizawa, argue that proponents of extended cognition commit a "coupling-constitution fallacy" by conflating causal coupling with cognitive constitution. They contend that merely because external resources are causally coupled to cognitive processes does not mean those resources constitute part of cognition itself. Adams and Aizawa propose a "mark of the cognitive" based on intrinsic content and non-derived representation as criteria for genuine cognition, arguing for "contingent intracranialism" rather than extended cognition.

Defenders of extended cognition have responded through multiple strategies. Menary develops the "cognitive integration" framework, arguing that coupled systems can form integrated wholes where the distinction between coupling and constitution dissolves. Wheeler and Sprevak defend "extended functionalism," arguing that functional role, not intrinsic properties, determines cognitive status. Kirchhoff and others propose that constitution should be understood dynamically and diachronically rather than synchronically. Recent work explores whether mutual manipulability, complementarity, and deep functional integration provide better criteria than the coupling-constitution distinction.

The debate fundamentally concerns how to individuate cognitive systems and whether location matters for cognitive status. It connects directly to broader questions about the vehicle-content distinction, the nature of mental representation, and the proper methodology for cognitive science.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The coupling-constitution debate is crucial for evaluating the extended mind thesis at a foundational level. It addresses the core conceptual and metaphysical issues that determine whether cognitive offloading genuinely extends cognition or merely provides external causal support. Understanding this debate is essential for assessing whether empirical research on cognitive offloading studies extended cognitive systems or brain-external tool use.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the debate has generated substantial philosophical discussion, there is limited work connecting the coupling-constitution distinction to empirical criteria that could distinguish cases. Recent work on mutual manipulability and mechanistic integration offers promising directions but remains underdeveloped. Five entries lack abstracts (menary2013cognitive, sprevak2009extended, theiner2010recognizing, huneman2013causal, menary2007cognitive) and are marked INCOMPLETE; these remain in the bibliography for completeness but are excluded from synthesis.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should trace the evolution of the debate from Adams and Aizawa's initial critique through various defensive strategies. It should clarify how different conceptions of constitution (synchronic vs. diachronic, intrinsic vs. functional) lead to different conclusions about extended cognition. The relationship between this philosophical debate and empirical research on cognitive offloading should be explicitly addressed.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Contingent Intracranialism (Adams, Aizawa): 6 papers - Extended cognition is logically possible but not actual; intrinsic content marks the cognitive
- Cognitive Integration (Menary): 4 papers - Integration dissolves the coupling-constitution distinction
- Extended Functionalism (Wheeler, Sprevak): 3 papers - Functional role, not location or intrinsic properties, determines cognitive status
- Mechanistic Constitution (Kirchhoff, Theiner): 3 papers - Mutual manipulability and mechanistic criteria ground constitution
- Critical/Neutral (Greif, Kagan): 2 papers - Examining the debate's assumptions or finding middle ground

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops the most sustained critique of extended cognition, arguing that proponents commit a "coupling-constitution fallacy" by inferring that causally coupled external resources constitute parts of cognitive systems. Proposes intrinsic non-derived content as the mark of the cognitive, defending "contingent intracranialism"—the view that while extended cognition is logically possible, actual cognitive processes are realized only in the brain.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the central challenge that any defense of extended cognition must address. The coupling-constitution distinction they introduce frames subsequent debates about what makes something genuinely cognitive rather than merely causally connected to cognition. Essential for understanding why critics reject cognitive offloading as genuine cognitive extension.

  POSITION: Contingent intracranialism based on intrinsic content criterion. Critical of extended mind thesis.

  abstract = {The present collection of essays contains illuminating discussions of a range of issues around cognition, self and agency. The introduction, written by Don Ross, has the title "Science Catches the Will", and this title provides a good clue to the focal point of the collection and also to the conception of the terrain we find in many of the essays; there is something here we ought to catch, and we ought to catch it by a scientific approach. Putting things like this, we immediately invite a number of further questions, among them questions about what the will is supposed to be, what central philosophers have thought that it is, what science is, and whether science thus understood carries the right approach to the major aspects of the questions raised. That in its turn brings up general questions about the relationship between science and philosophy. While there is no doubt that good philosophy is in deep need of being informed by and fully responsive to developments in science, there is a similar requirement that scientists approaching philosophical issues be responsive to the state of the art and to the nature of the philosophical problems. There are no sharp lines between science and philosophy; the important thing is always to know what you are doing and to do it well.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

There are fourteen good essays here, and the collection is an outgrowth of interaction over some time. The authors are mainly philosophers, all of them with wide interests in neighboring disciplines, many of them with research contributions of great significance in a much wider field than what is called philosophy. Some of the contributors are not professional philosophers; their work is nevertheless philosophical in nature and/or of great relevance to philosophical theorizing.

Looking back at the last fifty years of philosophy of mind and action, we see Davidson and Anscombe as very important contributors to work on and about the will at the beginning of this period. We see them engaging with questions about the will as it was conceived of by earlier philosophers, and we see both agreements and disagreement between them. The present collection starts from Davidson, and many contributors see him as someone who attempted to make room for naturalism by seeing reasons as causes, and, as one contributor, Miriam Thalos, puts it, "He sought to do justice to the idea of agency as ownership over behavior, while nonetheless preserving a basis for some semblance of a science of action" (p. 125 in her essay "The Sources of Behavior"). This idea of ownership is developed like this: "What is mine about a piece of behavior, among the scientifically minded nowadays, is the pro attitude that I direct towards it, in the form of a mental state" (p. 126).

Thalos, in her essay, builds her own position partly by contrasting her views with Davidson's. In particular, she argues against Davidson by trying to undermine what she calls his motivationalism. She presents a simple principle she sees as closely connected with Davidson's principles, and provides a counterexample to it. Her principle states that if you intend to do something, you are able to do it; if no new considerations arise, and you are not prevented from doing it, then you do it.

Of course there are counterexamples to this simple principle, and she provides one where you get lost in thought while driving away to do shopping, and arrive at your workplace instead of at the store. She foresees a Davidsonian response; that arriving at your workplace was not an intentional action. Davidson, when accounting for agency, was aiming for an account of doing something intentionally. Davidson only wants to be committed to the view that you in fact go for the act you want most if you intentionally carry out one of the acts you consider. Therefore, this counterexample to Thalos's principle might not undermine Davidson's position; he might have no reason to think her principle is true or something that is entailed by his views. Thalos holds such a reply to be "unworthy and implausible" (p. 130), since arriving at the workplace was an action in the present example.

Here, it seems to me, Davidson has a further reply that is not an implausible one. Arriving at the workplace was an action also on his account: the result of many "smaller" things we did intentionally while driving. There are on Davidson's picture many things we do in virtue of doing something else. Sometimes we do indeed intend to do A, get lost in thought, do many things intentionally, but fail to do A, and do B instead. Then doing B is an action, but not necessarily something we do intentionally; it might be an unintended result of doing many other things intentionally. It seems to me that this reply works for this case, and that Davidson avoids this particular criticism from Thalos.

There is, I think, a genuine issue about how good the Davidsonian approach is at providing understanding in cases of routine, cases where we act on "auto-pilot", but that is a different matter from the question of whether his account of agency and of doing something intentionally faces a real problem from this particular type of counterexample.

What seems to be happening throughout Thalos's extremely rich essay is that she is pursuing a theory of agency that is different in scope from that considered by Davidson, Anscombe, and others. She also pursues very many dimensions of agency, and is instructively inspired by Michael Bratman. If, however, agency is not restricted to what we do intentionally, many of the problems look very different, and so do the connections between reasons and actions in the account of agency. To illustrate: Davidson gave up giving necessary and sufficient conditions for agency because of the possibility of deviant causal chains. Thalos does not really discuss deviance, and maybe this indicates that the focus has shifted. Maybe her notion of agency does not face this problem at all, with the consequence that the climber who lets the rope go, startled by the thought that this is a possibility, acts in her sense of acting (or exhibiting agency) without intentionally letting the rope go.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to critics by clarifying and defending the coupling-constitution distinction. Argues that the distinction is not fallacious but rather identifies a genuine conceptual error in extended cognition arguments. External resources may enable or enhance cognitive processes without being constitutive parts of those processes, just as a hammer enables but does not constitute carpentry.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages with objections from extended cognition defenders, showing how the debate evolved through exchange. Clarifies what Adams and Aizawa mean by "constitution" and why they think location matters for cognitive status. Important for understanding the dialectical structure of the debate and the refined version of the critique.

Clark's hypothesis assumes that the nature of the processes internal to an object has nothing to do with whether that object carries out cognitive processing. The only condition required is that the object is coupled with a cognitive agent and interacts with it in a certain way. In making this tenuous connection, Clark commits the most common mistake extended mind theorists make; alleging that an object becomes cognitive once it is connected to a cognitive agent is a "coupling-constitution fallacy." From this fallacy, many hastily proceed to the conclusion that the object or process constitutes part of the agent's cognitive apparatus or cognitive processing.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that both of Adams and Aizawa's main criticisms fail against extended cognition. Their proposed mark of the cognitive (intrinsic non-derived content) does not successfully secure contingent intracranialism, as it either excludes paradigmatic cognitive processes or fails to exclude external resources. The coupling-constitution fallacy charge misses the point: extended cognition explicitly claims that coupling relations can ground constitution when certain conditions are met.

  RELEVANCE: Represents a sustained recent defense of extended cognition against the coupling-constitution critique. Shows that the debate hinges on what counts as an adequate criterion for cognition and whether location-based criteria are philosophically motivated or arbitrary. Connects the coupling-constitution debate to the mark of the cognitive problem.

  abstract = {Clark and Chalmers (1998) introduced the extended mind hypothesis, according to which some mental states can be realized by non-biological external resources. A lively debate has flourished around this hypothesis, connected with the issues of embodiment, embeddedness, situatedness and enaction (cf. Clark, 2008; Menary, 2010; Shapiro, 2011). Two of the main criticisms addressed to the functionalist version of the extended mind thesis have been the so-called “coupling-constitution fallacy” and the alleged lack of a mark of the cognitive (Adams and Aizawa, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010a,b). According to Adams and Aizawa, extended cognition is a logical possibility, but is not instantiated in our world. Following this view, they defend a “contingent intracranialism,” based on a specific mark of the cognitive that they propose. In this paper I intend to show that neither criticism is effective against the extended cognition thesis. In particular: the mark of the cognitive proposed by Adams and Aizawa does not secure contingent intracranialism; the coupling-constitution fallacy criticizes extended cognition on precisely the point the theory was intended to defend: namely, that the best way to individuate cognitive systems, given a minimal mark of the cognitive, is to rely on coupling relations between agents and environmental resources.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "cognitive integration" as an alternative framework to the coupling-constitution debate. Integrated cognitive systems involve bidirectional information flow, mutual manipulation, and complementary contributions from neural and external elements. When properly integrated, external resources do not merely support cognition but constitute the cognitive system itself. The coupling-constitution distinction assumes a problematic atomism about cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a positive alternative to the defensive strategies against Adams and Aizawa. Rather than defending the inference from coupling to constitution, Menary reconceptualizes the relationship: proper integration just is constitution. This framework has been influential in subsequent extended cognition literature and connects to mechanistic approaches in philosophy of science.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the cognitive integration framework to cultural practices and social scaffolding. Cognitive integration involves enculturation—the developmental process by which individuals become integrated with cultural cognitive practices. This diachronic perspective on integration provides a response to the synchronic focus of the coupling-constitution debate, showing how constitution can be developmental and historical.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how the cognitive integration response to the coupling-constitution debate connects to broader issues of cultural cognition and development. Relevant for understanding whether socially scaffolded cognitive practices count as genuinely extended or merely supported cognition. Expands the debate beyond individual-artifact coupling to social and cultural dimensions.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends extended cognition by reconceptualizing constitution in terms of mutual manipulability and mechanistic integration, drawing on Craver's mechanistic philosophy of neuroscience. External resources constitute parts of cognitive systems when they are mutually manipulable with internal processes and contribute non-redundantly to cognitive functions. This mechanistic criterion avoids both the coupling-constitution fallacy and the mark of the cognitive problem.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces mutual manipulability as a criterion for cognitive constitution, offering a middle path between Adams and Aizawa's intrinsic content criterion and purely functional approaches. This mechanistic framework has become increasingly influential and connects the extended cognition debate to debates about mechanistic explanation in cognitive science. Provides empirically grounded criteria for determining when external resources are constitutive.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper explores several paths by which the extended cognition (EC) thesis may overcome the coupling-constitution fallacy. In so doing, I address a couple of shortcomings in the contemporary literature. First, on the dimension of first-wave EC, I argue that constitutive arguments based on functional parity suffer from either a threat of cognitive bloat or an impasse with respect to determining the correct level of grain in the attribution of causal-functional roles. Second, on the dimension of second-wave EC, I argue that especially the complementarity approach suffers from a similar sort of dilemma as first-wave EC: an inability to justify just what entails the ontological claim of EC over the scaffolding claim of weaker approaches in cognitive science. In this paper I show that two much more promising explanations by which to ground the ontological claim of EC are available, both starting from an exploration of the coordination dynamics between environmental resources and neural resources. On the one hand, I argue that second-wave EC based on cognitive integration, with its focus on bodily manipulations constrained by cognitive norms, is capable of resolving the coupling-constitution fallacy. On the other hand, I argue that the framework of cognitive integration can be supplemented by philosophical accounts of mechanistic explanation, because such accounts enable us to explain the emergence of higher-level cognitive properties due to a system's organization-dependent structure.

Thanks to Richard Menary, John Sutton, and Will Newsome for helpful discussion. I am also grateful for the highly constructive comments made by two anonymous referees. Notes Notes [1] Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for proposing this response. [2] There is a slight disagreement in the mechanistic literature about the extent to which one can apply the mechanistic framework to cases of EC. In particular, Craver argues that “many cognitive mechanisms draw upon resources outside of the brain and outside of the body to such an extent that it is not fruitful to see the skin, or surface of the CNS, as a useful boundary” (2007, p. 141). However, Bechtel (2009 Bechtel, W. 2009. “Explanation: Mechanism, modularity, and situated cognition”. In The Cambridge handbook of situated cognition, Edited by: Robbins, P and Aydede, M. 155–170. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Google Scholar]) thinks that mechanistic explanations are more compatible with weaker embodied and situated approaches to cognition. Note that Bechtel does not think that this necessarily must be this way. As he mentions, what is critical for a mechanistic explanation is first to identify the phenomenon for which one is seeking an explanation (Bechtel, personal communication, January 11, 2011). If the system accomplishing the phenomenon functions as a result of causal interdependence between an individual and artifacts, then that is the place to locate the explanation. But, “my bet is that there will remain the task of explaining how the organism engages their environment, and that this phenomenon is to be explained inside the head and these will resemble the traditional explanations in cognitive psychology” (Bechtel, personal communication, January 11, 2011). This emerging picture between proponents of mechanistic explanation as to whether the framework can be applied to extended and distributed cognitive science is evidence of an important fact, namely that the ideas of EC are being discussed outside the mainstream debates over EC. Moreover, as I have already mentioned, Theiner (2009 Theiner, G. 2009. “Making sense of group cognition: The curious case of transactive memory systems”. In ASCS09: Proceedings of the 9th Conference of the Australasian Society for Cognitive Science, Edited by: Christensen, W, Schier, E and Sutton, J. 334–342.

Res cogitans extense: A philosophical defense of the extended mind thesis, Frankfurt: Peter Lang. [Google Scholar]) appeals to the framework of mechanistic explanation to resist the C-C fallacy in the context of his discussion of extended reasoning.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that functionalism about mental states naturally supports extended cognition. If mental states are individuated by their functional roles rather than their physical realization, then there is no principled reason to restrict cognitive states to the brain. Adams and Aizawa's intrinsic content criterion is incompatible with functionalism and would rule out many paradigmatically cognitive processes. The coupling-constitution issue dissolves under a properly functionalist framework.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how the coupling-constitution debate connects to fundamental issues in philosophy of mind about mental state individuation. If functionalism is correct, the extended mind thesis follows relatively straightforwardly and the coupling-constitution objection loses force. Important for understanding how different metaphysical frameworks shape the debate and for connecting extended cognition to broader functionalist commitments in cognitive science.

Proposes additional constraints on extended cognition including portability, reliability, and automatic endorsement, while maintaining that functional role rather than intrinsic properties determines cognitive status.

ExC claims that there are conditions under which thinking and thoughts are spatially distributed over the brain, body, and world in such a way that the external factors concerned are rightly accorded cognitive status. It is concerned mainly with the whereabouts of thinking and thoughts that is separate not only from the position adopted by orthodox cognitive science, but also from the position adopted by any embodied-embedded account of mind. Adams and Aizawa have repeatedly emphasized the insufficiency of thoughts being spatially distributed over brain, body, and world solely in the sense that applies when some instance of intelligent behavior is discovered to be causally dependent on the bodily exploitation of certain external props.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the coupling-constitution debate through the lens of biological functionalism and niche construction theory. Argues that an aetiological (historical) variety of functionalism helps specify when external entities constitute rather than merely couple with cognitive systems. Environmental coupling is constitutive when it is grounded in evolved biological functions and when it involves complementary rather than redundant contributions.

  RELEVANCE: Connects the coupling-constitution debate to evolutionary and developmental considerations, adding a temporal dimension often missing from synchronic analyses. Suggests that whether something is coupling or constitution may depend on its evolutionary and developmental history. Relevant for understanding how biological approaches to cognition intersect with the extended mind debate and whether cognitive offloading can become constitutive over developmental or evolutionary time.

  abstract = {Two aspects of cognitive coupling, as brought forward in the Extended Mind Hypothesis, are discussed in this paper: (1) how shall the functional coupling between the organism and some entity in his environment be spelled out in detail? (2) What are the paradigmatic external entities to enter into that coupling? These two related questions are best answered in the light of an aetiological variety of functionalist argument that adds historical depth to the “active externalism” promoted by Clark and Chalmers and helps to counter some of the core criticisms levelled against this view. Under additional reference to conceptual parallels between the Extended Mind Hypothesis and a set of heterodox theories in biology—environmental constructivism, niche construction, developmental systems theory—an argument for the grounding of environmentally extended cognitive traits in evolved biological functions is developed. In a spirit that seeks to integrate extended functionalism with views from cognitive integration and complementarity, it is argued (ad 1) that instances of environmental coupling should be understood as being constitutive to cognitive functions in either of two distinct ways. It is further argued (ad 2) that the historically and systematically prior environmental counterparts in that coupling are features of the natural environment. Language and linguistically imbued artefacts are likely to have descended from more basic relations that have an extension over the environment.},

If the disagreement is partly terminological, empirical research on cognitive offloading may proceed independently of settling the philosophical dispute.

Building on some suggestions from Haugeland, we contend that the system must exhibit a distinctive sort of semantic activity, semantic activity that the system as a whole takes responsibility for.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to criticisms of the original extended mind paper, including the coupling-constitution fallacy charge. Argues that the extended mind thesis does not rest on a fallacious inference but rather on parity principles and functional criteria. Introduces complementarity, portability, trust, and glue as markers of cognitive extension. Cognitive systems should be individuated by their overall functional architecture rather than spatial location.

  RELEVANCE: Clark's most sustained defense of extended cognition, directly addressing Adams and Aizawa's coupling-constitution critique. Influential for subsequent debates and widely cited as the definitive statement of the extended mind position. Essential for understanding how the debate evolved from the original 1998 paper through critical responses.

  abstract = {Abstract Studies of mind, thought, and reason have tended to marginalize the role of bodily form, real-world action, and environmental backdrop. In recent years, both in philosophy and cognitive science, this tendency has been identified and, increasingly, resisted. The result is a plethora of work on what has become known as embodied, situated, distributed, and even ‘extended’ cognition. Work in this new, loosely-knit field depicts thought and reason as in some way inextricably tied to the details of our gross bodily form, our habits of action and intervention, and the enabling web of social, cultural, and technological scaffolding in which we live, move, learn, and think. But exactly what kind of link is at issue? And what difference might such a link or links make to our best philosophical, psychological, and computational models of thought and reason? These are among the large unsolved problems in this increasingly popular field. This book offers both a tour of the emerging landscape, and an argument in favour of one approach to the key issues. That approach combines the use of representational, computational, and information-theoretic tools with an appreciation of the importance of context, timing, biomechanics, and dynamics. More controversially, it depicts some coalitions of biological and non-biological resources as the extended cognitive circuitry of individual minds.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the coupling-constitution debate to group cognition, arguing that groups can constitute genuine cognitive systems when members are functionally integrated through dense interactive coupling, collective intentionality, and complementary specialization. Proposes criteria for recognizing when socially extended cognition involves constitution rather than mere causal interaction, drawing on mechanistic and systems-theoretic frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how the coupling-constitution debate scales to social and collective cognition. The criteria proposed for group cognition (dense coupling, complementarity, mechanistic integration) may also apply to individual extended cognition involving artifacts. Relevant for understanding whether collaborative cognitive offloading involves genuinely distributed cognitive systems.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges Adams and Aizawa's intrinsic content criterion by arguing that the notion of intrinsic properties is incoherent or at least problematic for cognitive science. All properties are relational at some level of analysis. If intrinsic content is required for cognition, it is unclear whether any processes count as cognitive. The coupling-constitution distinction presupposes an untenable metaphysics of intrinsic properties.

  RELEVANCE: Raises fundamental metaphysical questions about the coherence of Adams and Aizawa's criterion. If intrinsic properties are problematic, their mark of the cognitive collapses. This connects the coupling-constitution debate to broader issues in metaphysics about intrinsic versus extrinsic properties and whether location-based criteria can be metaphysically grounded.

  POSITION: Critique of intrinsic content criterion based on relational nature of all properties.

  abstract = {Abstract The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) has been criticized as committing what is called the coupling–constitution fallacy, but it is the critic's use of this concept which is fallacious. It is true that there is no reason to deny that the line between the self and the world should be drawn at the skull and/or the skin. But the data used to support HEC reveal that there was never a good enough reason to draw the line there in the first place. The burden of proof has fallen on the mind–brain identity theory, now that our intuitions/prejudices no longer support it. One of those “intuitions” is the Aristotelian assumption that the world can be neatly divided into objects that possess intrinsic causal powers, and the causal relations that connect those objects. In modern science, however, the concept of intrinsic causal powers is only a temporary stopgap that makes it possible to begin research in a particular area. It therefore seems best to assume that the line between mind and world is both pragmatic and dynamic. Consequently, the mind might best described as a fluctuating field, rather than an object or structure. Keywords: Behavioral FieldCoupling–Constitution FallacyExtended CognitionFrederick AdamsRobert RupertAndy ClarkKenneth Aizawa Notes [1] This is one of the most common, and most easily answered, objections to HEC. Bickle implies that the mind–brain identity theory must be true because “We cannot—as a matter of empirical fact, not metaphysical intuition—intervene into any environmental components of a causal nexus to change the behavioral effect, without evoking changes in the nervous system” (2008, p. 510). However, this fact, and the other empirical facts that Bickle cites after this quote, only show that the brain is necessary for mental states, and identity requires both necessity and sufficiency. Spark plugs are necessary in order to have a functioning car, but the fact that they are not sufficient prevents one from driving to work with nothing but a set of spark plugs. He also points out that “we can invoke behavioral change by manipulating neural components in the causal nexus, without changing the normal environmental components one iota … experimental techniques exist for doing exactly this” (Bickle, Citation2008, pp. 510–511). This does not, however, prove that these neural components are identical to the experiences of the organism being manipulated. A fuse box can control the lighting system of an entire house, but that does not make the fuse box identical to the lighting system. Neurophilosophers often cite detailed facts to support a position, but the real challenge is often determining whether facts of that sort actually support their position. [2] Or more accurately, societies of cognizers understanding their world, although that idea is still new even for HEC theorists. We obviously do not live in a multisolipsistic universe in which each organism has its own self-contained world. The world in the mind's brain–body–world nexus contains not only other physical items, but also other minds. The symbiotic relationship that mutually constitutes minds and physical items is both different from and similar to the sympathetic relationship that mutually constitutes minds in a shared world. There is obviously a great deal that needs to be said about these similarities and differences. Heidegger acknowledged the differences when he made a distinction between (1) the present-at-hand and ready-to-hand being of physical objects and (2) the being-with that we share with other dasein (Heidegger, Citation1926/1962, pp. 153–163). However, as is his wont, Heidegger said very little about how to explain these differences in scientific terms. In Rockwell (Citation2007), there is some discussion of the possibility that people who have strong sympathetic attachments to each other (family, friends, etc.) could be said in some sense to feel the same emotion, rather than be aware of each other's different emotions. These kinds of sympathetic attachments would fluctuate if the mind is a behavioral field, which would create the illusion that these minds are intrinsically separate and distinct. Like the rest of the HEC, this is counterintuitive and weird, but there is no denying that there are serious problems with the current paradigm of isolated rational egos that has emerged from our Cartesian presuppositions. That, however, is a subject for another book, at the very least.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the coupling-constitution debate by comparing it to parallel debates in philosophy of biology about organism-environment relations. Argues that causal parity principles apply in both domains: when internal and external factors play equivalent causal roles, there is no principled basis for privileging internal over external factors as constitutive. The coupling-constitution distinction may reflect explanatory rather than metaphysical commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Connects the coupling-constitution debate to broader issues about externalism across life sciences and cognitive science. Shows structural parallels between extended mind debates and developmental systems theory in biology. Relevant for understanding whether the coupling-constitution distinction reflects genuine metaphysical boundaries or pragmatic explanatory choices.

  abstract = {Leading scholars respond to the famous proposition by Andy Clark and David Chalmers that cognition and mind are not located exclusively in the head. Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin? In their famous 1998 paper "The Extended Mind," philosophers Andy Clark and David J. Chalmers posed this question and answered it provocatively: cognitive processes "ain't all in the head." The environment has an active role in driving cognition; cognition is sometimes made up of neural, bodily, and environmental processes. Their argument excited a vigorous debate among philosophers, both supporters and detractors. This volume brings together for the first time the best responses to Clark and Chalmers's bold proposal. These responses, together with the original paper by Clark and Chalmers, offer a valuable overview of the latest research on the extended mind thesis. The contributors first discuss (and answer) objections raised to Clark and Chalmers's thesis. Clark himself responds to critics in an essay that uses the movie Memento's amnesia-aiding notes and tattoos to illustrate the workings of the extended mind. Contributors then consider the different directions in which the extended mind project might be taken, including the need for an approach that focuses on cognitive activity and practice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that emotional development provides a case where external social scaffolding becomes deeply functionally integrated with internal processes through ontogenesis. While this does not establish extended cognition synchronically, it shows how the coupling-constitution debate must consider developmental and diachronic dimensions. Some forms of "contingent transcranialism" may be compatible with deep functional integration.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how developmental considerations complicate the coupling-constitution debate. External scaffolding during development may become so integrated that the resulting cognitive capacities cannot be understood without reference to those external factors, even if they are not synchronically present. Relevant for understanding how cognitive offloading practices acquired through development might transform cognitive architecture.

  POSITION: Developmental perspective showing deep functional integration without necessarily endorsing synchronic extended cognition.

  abstract = {Abstract Contingent transcranialists claim that the physical mechanisms of mind are not exclusively intracranial and that genuine cognitive systems can extend into cognizers' physical and socio-cultural environments. They further claim that extended cognitive systems must include the deep functional integration of external environmental resources with internal neural resources. They have found it difficult, however, to explicate the precise nature of such deep functional integration and provide compelling examples of it. Contingent intracranialists deny that extracranial resources can be components of genuine extended cognitive systems. They claim that transcranialists fallaciously conflate coupling with constitution and construe cognition as extending always from brains into world rather than world into brains. By using insights from recent research in developmental psychology and by explicating the nature of one form that deep functional integration can take, I argue that (i) transcranialists do not fallaciously conflate coupling wth constitution, and (ii) human emotional ontogenesis is a world-to-brain transcranial achievement.
