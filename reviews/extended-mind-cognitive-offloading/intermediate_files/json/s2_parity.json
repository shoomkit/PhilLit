      "abstract": "Through a discussion of the socially extended mind, this paper advances the \u201cnot possible without principle\u201d as an alternative to the social parity principle. By charging the social parity principle with reductionism about the social dimension of socially extended processes, the paper offers a new argumentative strategy for the socially extended mind that stresses its existential significance. The \u201cnot possible without principle\u201d shows that not only is something more achieved through socially located processes of knowledge building, but also that, and more importantly, what is achieved is something that would not have been possible without social interaction . The social parity principle states that the result of an activity achieved via social interaction should be assumed functionally equivalent to a solitary investigation and is characterized by multiple realisability. Contrary to the social parity principle, the \u201cnot possible without principle\u201d holds that the result would not have been achieved without the social interaction between (at least) two agents with specific existential needs. The socially extended mind never happens in a void. This means that the \"not possible without\" principle should be located in real-life, affectively charged, embodied experiences of skilful interactions between agents. This fundamental conceptual change via reference to the \u201cexistential necessity\u201d that regulates socially extended processes is necessary in order to effectively lead the socially extended mind to a truly embedded and embodied account.",

This view has split into various branches ranging from a weak form on the brink of functionalism (loosely represented by Clarks\u2019 parity principle) to a strong form (often corresponding to autopoietic-friendly enactivism) suggesting that body\u2013world interactions constitute cognition. From an ontological perspective, however, constitution is a problematic notion with no obvious empirical or technical advantages. This paper discusses the ontological issues of these two approaches in regard to embodied AI and its ontological commitments: circularity, epiphenomenalism, mentalism, and disguised dualism. The paper also outlines an even more radical approach that may offer some ontological advantages. The new approach, called the mind-object identity, is then briefly compared with sensorimotor direct realism and with the embodied identity theory.",

In this chapter, a Reversed Parity Principle is outlined, which can be used to show how humans can \u201chack\u201d their own minds in order to build inner mental tools, thus changing our existing cognitive abilities in yet another way. The Reversed Parity Principle (RRP) invites a perspectival shift that is potentially as illuminating as the extended mind shift. Whereas extended mind arguments invite us to think of ourselves as broader, wider, and larger than we might otherwise, the RPP invites us to consider the strangeness and otherness that lies within what would normally be considered to be \u201cus.\u201d",

Focusing on cognitive integration and the Trust and Glue criteria, we have two objectives. First, we examine how ExM reshapes perspectives on human-AI interaction, particularly by challenging the Standard model of AI. We argue that AI, as an active non-organic agent, significantly influences cognitive processes beyond initial expectations. Secondly, we propose the maintainability as a fourth criterion in the Trust and Glue criteria of ExM, in addition to trustworthiness, reliability and accessibility. This addition aims to evaluate parity in coupled systems comprehensively addressing concerns about control in human-AI interactions. We highlight the risks posed by AI\u2019s understanding of human psychology, which may lead to unintended shifts in our objectives and choices. Our analysis concludes that maintainability serves as a critical safeguard against the evolving challenges of human-AI integration.",

      "abstract": "Palermos\u2019s (2023) concept of \u201cmental data\u201d is appreciated as advancing fresh considerations in urgent discourse on mental privacy. However, it is suggested that the proposal for an ontologically distinct category of mental data as currently drafted is nongenerative of novel privacy measures. I agree that mind-related data pose nascent risks\u2014but not because they constitute part of the mind. This commentary argues that recognizing mental constituents apropos the Extended Mind Thesis (Clark and Chalmers 1998) is arbitrary for the interests of privacy, which are independent of the ontological status of mind-sensitive content. It is enough that data represent minds to elicit concern, to the conclusion that the Extended Mind Thesis is normatively inert with respect to motivating legal revision. Nevertheless, I support the appeal for technological protections, and suggest that a reformulated version of mental data might hold promise for mental privacy approaches. The Extended Mind Thesis (EMT) posits that human mental states and processes are not confined to a person\u2019s physical boundaries, but can reach into the environment to be realized in external artifacts. Palermos (2023) argues that if the EMT is correct, informational content derived from cognitively integrated applications counts as part of the mind and can be regarded as \u201cmental data,\u201d and that this generates novel privacy considerations. I suggest this paradigm is unserviceable for the purpose of legal and ethical revision as Palermos claims, for the reason that there are morally relevant differences between data types that the concept of mental data fails to distinguish. These materialize in the two following ways. First, mental data neglect normative features of attendant data types. As long as agent and artifact comprise a mutually coupled system, mental data describe both synchronous and non-occurrent information regardless of medium. By the received view, the latter condition holds that mental contents extend to \u201cuncoupled peripherals,\u201d which would mean that non-occurrent mental data have long been stored in analogue formats (e.g., the proverbial \u201cpaper trail\u201d), and more recently in digital systems. But unlike outmoded predecessors, contemporary data types that have emerged with the advent of digital technology present new, morally relevant aspects. To wit: Digital platforms enable the mass storage, transfer, collection, and dissemination of content on a scale unprecedented. This brings with it obvious privacy concerns that do not apply, or only partially apply, to traditional media. Simply put, material data sources are saddled with access and transmissibility limits in comparison to digital formats, and the only practical means of overriding these constraints is digitization. What this indicates is that normatively germane distinctions exist between certain kinds of mental data. However, such variations are independent of whether or not one accepts the EMT. That is because the EMT integrates both digital and analogue content coextensively\u2014meaning that the term \u201cmental data\u201d is applied to both pen-and-paper and keypad-and-processor indiscriminately. In other words, further categorization is needed to point to the morally salient features of mental data types because the EMT doesn\u2019t get us any further toward identifying what is of normative significance. What actually prompts fresh ethical concerns is not the acknowledgment that minds extend into the environment, but that personal data about minds now extend into the digital multiverse. The principle issue is therefore one of mental privacy with respect to digital data. With that stated, mental data raise a further concern that warrants attention. A second consideration is that endorsement of the EMT would omit types of informational content about minds that seem apt for the title of mental data. Under the EMT, a condition for mind-constituting artifacts is that they are coupled with an agent in a bidirectional process of causal effect. Minds do not",

As we shall see, however, there are strong arguments for both of these positions. On the one hand, there is a compelling argument for vehicle externalism: the parity argument from Clark and Chalmers (1998). On the other hand, there is a compelling argument for accessibilism: the Moorean argument from Smithies (2012). If accessibilism is incompatible with vehicle externalism, then both arguments cannot be sound. I resolve the tension by arguing that the Moorean argument succeeds, while the parity argument fails, and hence that vehicle externalism should be rejected on broadly epistemological grounds.",

Borrowed from the domain of cognitive science, the principle of \u201cactive externalism\u201d in general and the Extended Mind Theory in particular form the theoretical framework of the project. The practical component draws on the work of the Late Modernist Samuel Beckett and examines (1) the interactive cognitive relationship between the author and the material output of his work at various stages of the writing process (by means of genetic manuscript analysis), and (2) the way Beckett\u2019s fictional characters interact with their environment. The purpose of the article is thus twofold: on the one hand, it demonstrates in a nutshell that cognitive processes involved in the production of narratives can be extended to include extracranial objects. In a separate line of enquiry, Beckett\u2019s fictional minds are shown to be firmly embedded in their narrative contexts (contrary to the popular belief in the hegemony of introspection in modernist narratives), as several examples from Beckett\u2019s (published) texts will demonstrate how fictional minds, too, extend beyond skin and skull.",

Traditional cognitive science often views the mind as confined within the brain, but we argue that cognition is not merely extended but fundamentally constituted through ongoing material engagements with technical images within specific sociocultural contexts. Our interdisciplinary approach integrates cognitive archaeology, media theory, and cognitive sciences, emphasising the dynamic, embodied, and situated nature of cognition. This perspective shifts the understanding of the mind from a static, internal entity to a dynamic, distributed process continually mediated through organismic transactions in the environment. Building on this tradition of studies in the extended mind, we introduce the Mediational-Constitutional Principle, arguing that technical images not only trigger cognitive processes but actively constitute them. In the paper, we illustrate how technical images mediate and constitute the sense of self because they are central in how memory is continually re-enacted in specific sociomaterial environments made of people, things, and practices. These images function as automatic ecological records, blending past and present, influencing personal narratives and memory.",

      "abstract": "Revolutionary experiments in space, carried out in the XXI century, proved the physical non-existence of space and time. Infinitely extended space is also uniformly filled with boundless matter in the form of discrete clusters of mass-energy. Time, on the other hand, turns out to be a fixation of the sequence and duration of cause-and-effect relationships in any process occurring in and be\u00adtween material objects. Therefore, nature is dualistic: it exists in the form of two conditionally independent principles \u2013 non-existence (non-existent space-time continuum) and being (the existing material-ideal Cosmos). At the same time, the physical existence of matter is unthinkable without the physical non-exis\u00adtence of space-time. The Cosmos is also dualistic, dividing into two interdepen\u00addent objects: a) the transitory material (mass-energy) and the imperishable ideal (laws, principles and algorithms of the existence of matter); b) the countless discrete mass-energy dynamic Small Universes (galaxies and their clusters). Together they make up one stationary Large Universe, unlimited in mass and en\u00adergy. At the same time, the material and the ideal together form four intercon\u00adnected steps of the pyramid of the Cosmos: a) the world of elementary particles; b) the world of galaxies, stars and planets; c) the sphere of organics; d) the sphere of culture. Accordingly, a human-like mind turns out to be a categorically impe\u00adrative element of the Cosmos. This conclusion follows from the fact of the limi\u00adted duration of the active phase of the existence of Small Universes. The lat\u00adter circumstance is associated with an irreversible deterioration in the quality of the energy of stars and the extinction of their life cycle. However, currently physics does not know any natural process capable of regenerating the mass- energy of aging stars and reviving their activity. Consequently, for the artificial resumption of the vital activity of Small Universes, in fact, to maintain the eter\u00adnal existence of the Large Universe, a human-like mind is needed (a super-strong anthropic principle). Thus, there is a need to rethink the phenomenon of evo\u00adlution as a global process that encompasses the specifics of the interconnected existence of all four \u201chorizons\u201d of Nature.",

In the last years, we are witnessing a real \u201caffective turn\u201d in the domain of analytic philosophy of mind and cognitive science, and situated affectivity is an excellent example of what is going on in the field. In the first part, I will present the main versions of situated affectivity, distinguishing between the ideas of situated or scaffolded emotions (Griffi-ths, Scarantino 2009; Colombetti, Krueger 2015) and properly extended emotions (Carter et al. 2016; Colombetti, Roberts 2015), and showing their link to the corresponding idea of the mind: scaffolded, extended or otherwise. In the second part, I will further explore the connection between situated affectivity and the domain of extended mind: I will argue that, even if situated affectivity could be in principle evaluated independently from any particular theory about the mind, dealing with situated affectivity is, beside its independent interest, also a good way to tackle an unsettled problem in the literature on extended mind, namely extended consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Scientific, medical, and technological knowledge has transformed our world, but we still poorly understand the nature of scientific methodology. Science textbooks, science dictionaries, and science institutions often state that scientists follow, and should follow, the universal scientific method of testing hypotheses using observation and experimentation. Yet, scientific methodology has not been systematically analyzed using large-scale data and scientific methods themselves as it is viewed as not easily amenable to scientific study. Using data on all major discoveries across science including all Nobel Prize and major non-Nobel Prize discoveries, we can address the question of the extent to which \u201cthe scientific method\u201d is actually applied in making science's groundbreaking research and whether we need to expand this central concept of science. This study reveals that 25% of all discoveries since 1900 did not apply the common scientific method (all three features)\u2014with 6% of discoveries using no observation, 23% using no experimentation, and 17% not testing a hypothesis. Empirical evidence thus challenges the common view of the scientific method. Adhering to it as a guiding principle would constrain us in developing many new scientific ideas and breakthroughs. Instead, assessing all major discoveries, we identify here a general, common feature that the method of science can be reduced to: making all major discoveries has required using sophisticated methods and instruments of science. These include statistical methods, particle accelerators, and X-ray methods. Such methods extend our mind and generally make observing, experimenting, and testing hypotheses in science possible, doing so in new ways and ensure their replicability. This provides a new perspective to the scientific method\u2014embedded in our sophisticated methods and instruments\u2014and suggests that we need to reform and extend the way we view the scientific method and discovery process.",

This parity allegedly is supported by situated cognition theories showing how external devices can be part of a cognitive system. This article will evaluate this suggestion. It will reject the claim, that situated cognition theories support ethical parity. It will however point out another reason, why external carriers or modifications of the mental might come to be considered ethically on par with internal carriers. Section \u201cWhy Could There Be Ethical Parity between Neural Tissue and External Tools?\u201d presents the ethical parity theses between external and internal carriers of the mind as well as neurotechnological alterations and established alterations. Section \u201cExtended, Embodied, Embedded: Situated Cognition as a Relational Thesis\u201d will elaborate the different situated cognition approaches and their relevance for ethics. It will evaluate, whether transcranial stimulation technologies are plausible candidates for situated cognition theses. Section \u201cOn the Ethical Relevance of Situated Cognition Theses\u201d will discuss criteria for evaluating whether a cognitive tool is deeply embedded with a cognitive system and apply these criteria to transcranial brain stimulation technologies. Finally it will discuss the role diverse versions of situated cognition theory can play in the ethics of altering mental states, especially the ethics of transcranial brain stimulation technologies.",
