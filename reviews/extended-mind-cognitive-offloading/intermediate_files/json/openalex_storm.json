      "abstract": "The impact of the Internet across multiple aspects of modern society is clear. However, the influence that it may have on our brain structure and functioning remains a central topic of investigation. Here we draw on recent psychological, psychiatric and neuroimaging findings to examine several key hypotheses on how the Internet may be changing our cognition. Specifically, we explore how unique features of the online world may be influencing: a) attentional capacities, as the constantly evolving stream of online information encourages our divided attention across multiple media sources, at the expense of sustained concentration; b) memory processes, as this vast and ubiquitous source of online information begins to shift the way we retrieve, store, and even value knowledge; and c) social cognition, as the ability for online social settings to resemble and evoke real\u2010world social processes creates a new interplay between the Internet and our social lives, including our self\u2010concepts and self\u2010esteem. Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be integrated into broader research settings to study how this unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and the brain across the life course.",

      "abstract": "According to Mednick's (1962) theory of individual differences in creativity, creative individuals appear to have a richer and more flexible associative network than less creative individuals. Thus, creative individuals are characterized by \"flat\" (broader associations) instead of \"steep\" (few, common associations) associational hierarchies. To study these differences, we implement a novel computational approach to the study of semantic networks, through the analysis of free associations. The core notion of our method is that concepts in the network are related to each other by their association correlations-overlap of similar associative responses (\"association clouds\"). We began by collecting a large sample of participants who underwent several creativity measurements and used a decision tree approach to divide the sample into low and high creative groups. Next, each group underwent a free association generation paradigm which allowed us to construct and analyze the semantic networks of both groups. Comparison of the semantic memory networks of persons with low creative ability and persons with high creative ability revealed differences between the two networks. The semantic memory network of persons with low creative ability seems to be more rigid, compared to the network of persons with high creative ability, in the sense that it is more spread out and breaks apart into more sub-parts. We discuss how our findings are in accord and extend Mednick's (1962) theory and the feasibility of using network science paradigms to investigate high level cognition.",

After a systematic search of the Chinese and English language literature on COVID\u201019, 75 studies were used to conduct a series of meta\u2010analyses on the relationship of individuals with obesity\u2013COVID\u201019 over the full spectrum from risk to mortality. A systematic review of the mechanistic pathways for COVID\u201019 and individuals with obesity is presented. Pooled analysis show individuals with obesity were more at risk for COVID\u201019 positive, &gt;46.0% higher (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30\u20131.65; p &lt; 0.0001); for hospitalization, 113% higher (OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.74\u20132.60; p &lt; 0.0001); for ICU admission, 74% higher (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.46\u20132.08); and for mortality, 48% increase in deaths (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22\u20131.80; p &lt; 0.001). Mechanistic pathways for individuals with obesity are presented in depth for factors linked with COVID\u201019 risk, severity and their potential for diminished therapeutic and prophylactic treatments among these individuals. Individuals with obesity are linked with large significant increases in morbidity and mortality from COVID\u201019. There are many mechanisms that jointly explain this impact. A major concern is that vaccines will be less effective for the individuals with obesity.",

      "abstract": "Growing main memory capacity has fueled the development of in-memory big data management and processing. By eliminating disk I/O bottleneck, it is now possible to support interactive data analytics. However, in-memory systems are much more sensitive to other sources of overhead that do not matter in traditional I/O-bounded disk-based systems. Some issues such as fault-tolerance and consistency are also more challenging to handle in in-memory environment. We are witnessing a revolution in the design of database systems that exploits main memory as its data storage layer. Many of these researches have focused along several dimensions: modern CPU and memory hierarchy utilization, time/space efficiency, parallelism, and concurrency control. In this survey, we aim to provide a thorough review of a wide range of in-memory data management and processing proposals and systems, including both data storage systems and data processing frameworks. We also give a comprehensive presentation of important technology in memory management, and some key factors that need to be considered in order to achieve efficient in-memory data management and processing.",

We first introduce the key ML methods drawing connections to econometric practice. We then identify current limitations of the econometric and simulation model toolbox in applied economics and explore potential solutions afforded by ML. We dive into cases such as inflexible functional forms, unstructured data sources and large numbers of explanatory variables in both prediction and causal analysis, and highlight the challenges of complex simulation models. Finally, we argue that economists have a vital role in addressing the shortcomings of ML when used for quantitative economic analysis.",

      "abstract": "As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, the world is facing a major public health concern. Obesity is a complex disease associated with an increase in several inflammatory markers, leading to chronic low-grade inflammation. Of multifactorial etiology, it is often used as a measurement of morbidity and mortality. There remains much unknown regarding the association between obesity and inflammation. This review seeks to compile scientific literature on obesity and its associated inflammatory markers in chronic disease and further discusses the role of adipose tissue, macrophages, B-cells, T-cells, fatty acids, amino acids, adipokines, and hormones in obesity. Data were obtained using PubMed and Google Scholar. Obesity, inflammation, immune cells, hormones, fatty acids, and others were search words used to acquire relevant articles. Studies suggest brown adipose tissue is negatively associated with body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage. Researchers also found the adipose tissue of lean individuals predominantly secretes anti-inflammatory markers, while in obese individuals more pro-inflammatory markers are secreted. Many studies found that adipose tissue in obese individuals showed a shift in immune cells from anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, which was also correlated with insulin resistance. Obese individuals generally present with higher levels of hormones such as leptin, visfatin, and resistin. With obesity on the rise globally, it is predicted that severe obesity will become most common amongst low-income adults, black individuals, and women by 2030, making the need for intervention urgent. Further investigation into the association between obesity and inflammation is required to understand the mechanism behind this disease.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Coxiella burnetii is the agent of Q fever, or \u201cquery fever,\u201d a zoonosis first described in Australia in 1937. Since this first description, knowledge about this pathogen and its associated infections has increased dramatically. We review here all the progress made over the last 20 years on this topic. C. burnetii is classically a strict intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium. However, a major step in the characterization of this pathogen was achieved by the establishment of its axenic culture. C. burnetii infects a wide range of animals, from arthropods to humans. The genetic determinants of virulence are now better known, thanks to the achievement of determining the genome sequences of several strains of this species and comparative genomic analyses. Q fever can be found worldwide, but the epidemiological features of this disease vary according to the geographic area considered, including situations where it is endemic or hyperendemic, and the occurrence of large epidemic outbreaks. In recent years, a major breakthrough in the understanding of the natural history of human infection with C. burnetii was the breaking of the old dichotomy between \u201cacute\u201d and \u201cchronic\u201d Q fever. The clinical presentation of C. burnetii infection depends on both the virulence of the infecting C. burnetii strain and specific risks factors in the infected patient. Moreover, no persistent infection can exist without a focus of infection. This paradigm change should allow better diagnosis and management of primary infection and long-term complications in patients with C. burnetii infection.",

      "abstract": "Creativity is one of the most important assets we have to navigate through the fast changing world of the 21st century. Anecdotal accounts of creative individuals suggest that oftentimes, creative discoveries result from a process whereby initial conscious thought is followed by a period during which one refrains from task-related conscious thought. For example, one may spend an embarrassing amount of time thinking about a problem when the solution suddenly pops into consciousness while taking a shower. Not only creative individuals but also traditional theories of creativity have put a lot of emphasis on this incubation stage in creative thinking. The aim of the present article is twofold. First, an overview of the domain of incubation and creativity is provided by reviewing and discussing studies on incubation, mind-wandering, and sleep. Second, the causes of incubation effects are discussed. Previously, little attention has been paid to the causes of incubation effects and most findings do not really speak to whether the effects should be explained by unconscious processes or merely by consequences of a period of distraction. In the latter case, there is no need to assume active unconscious processes. The findings discussed in the current article support the idea that it is not merely the absence of conscious thought that drives incubation effects, but that during an incubation period unconscious processes contribute to creative thinking. Finally, practical implications and directions for future research will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Since the approval of the first monoclonal antibody (mAb) in 1986, a huge effort has been made to guarantee safety and efficacy of therapeutic mAbs. As of July 2021, 118 mAbs are approved for the European market for a broad range of clinical indications. In order to ensure clinical efficacy and safety aspects, (pre-)clinical experimental approaches evaluate the respective modes of action (MoA). In addition to antigen-specificity including binding affinity and -avidity, MoA comprise Fc-mediated effector functions such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and the closely related antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). For this reason, a variety of cell-based assays have been established investigating effector functions of therapeutic mAbs with different effector/target-cell combinations and several readouts including Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc\u03b3R)-mediated lysis, fluorescence, or luminescence. Optimized Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector functions regarding clinical safety and efficacy are addressed with modification strategies such as point mutations, altered glycosylation patterns, combination of different Fc subclasses (cross isotypes), and Fc-truncation of the mAb. These strategies opened the field for a next generation of therapeutic mAbs. In conclusion, it is of major importance to consider Fc\u03b3R-mediated effector functions for the efficacy of therapeutic mAbs.",

      "abstract": "Plants encounter several biotic and abiotic stresses, usually in combination. This results in major economic losses in agriculture and forestry every year. Climate change aggravates the adverse effects of combined stresses and increases such losses. Trees suffer even more from the recurrence of biotic and abiotic stress combinations owing to their long lifecycle. Despite the effort to study the damage from individual stress factors, less attention has been given to the effect of the complex interactions between multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. In this review, we assess the importance, impact, and mitigation strategies of climate change driven interactions between biotic and abiotic stresses in forestry. The ecological and economic importance of biotic and abiotic stresses under different combinations is highlighted by their contribution to the decline of the global forest area through their direct and indirect roles in forest loss and to the decline of biodiversity resulting from local extinction of endangered species of trees, emission of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and reduction in the productivity and quality of forest products and services. The abiotic stress factors such as high temperature and drought increase forest disease and insect pest outbreaks, decrease the growth of trees, and cause tree mortality. Reports of massive tree mortality events caused by \u201chotter droughts\u201d are increasing all over the world, affecting several genera of trees including some of the most important genera in plantation forests, such as Pine, Poplar, and Eucalyptus . While the biotic stress factors such as insect pests, pathogens, and parasitic plants have been reported to be associated with many of these mortality events, a considerable number of the reports have not taken into account the contribution of such biotic factors. The available mitigation strategies also tend to undermine the interactive effect under combined stresses. Thus, this discussion centers on mitigation strategies based on research and innovation, which build on models previously used to curb individual stresses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The Sahel experienced a severe drought during the 1970s and 1980s after wet periods in the 1950s and 1960s. Although rainfall partially recovered since the 1990s, the drought had devastating impacts on society. Most studies agree that this dry period resulted primarily from remote effects of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies amplified by local land surface\u2013atmosphere interactions. This paper reviews advances made during the last decade to better understand the impact of global SST variability on West African rainfall at interannual to decadal time scales. At interannual time scales, a warming of the equatorial Atlantic and Pacific/Indian Oceans results in rainfall reduction over the Sahel, and positive SST anomalies over the Mediterranean Sea tend to be associated with increased rainfall. At decadal time scales, warming over the tropics leads to drought over the Sahel, whereas warming over the North Atlantic promotes increased rainfall. Prediction systems have evolved from seasonal to decadal forecasting. The agreement among future projections has improved from CMIP3 to CMIP5, with a general tendency for slightly wetter conditions over the central part of the Sahel, drier conditions over the western part, and a delay in the monsoon onset. The role of the Indian Ocean, the stationarity of teleconnections, the determination of the leader ocean basin in driving decadal variability, the anthropogenic role, the reduction of the model rainfall spread, and the improvement of some model components are among the most important remaining questions that continue to be the focus of current international projects.",
