# Literature Review Plan: Extended Mind Thesis and Cognitive Offloading

## Research Idea Summary

This review examines the philosophical foundations of the extended mind thesis (Clark and Chalmers 1998) and its relationship to empirical research on cognitive offloading. The project investigates how external resources function in cognitive processes, exploring theoretical debates (parity principle, coupling-constitution) alongside empirical findings on memory, problem-solving, and navigation, with particular attention to digital technologies and smartphones.

## Key Research Questions

1. What are the core philosophical commitments of the extended mind thesis and how have they been defended or challenged?
2. How does empirical research on cognitive offloading relate to and inform debates about extended cognition?
3. What is the current state of debate regarding digital technologies (especially smartphones) as candidates for cognitive extension?
4. What are the implications for cognitive enhancement and technology design?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Extended Mind Thesis - Foundational Theory

**Focus**: Clark and Chalmers' original thesis, core arguments, parity principle, and immediate responses

**Key Questions**:
- What is the extended mind thesis and what motivates it?
- How do Clark and Chalmers argue for cognitive extension beyond the brain?
- What role does the parity principle play in the original argument?
- What are the functionalist and externalist commitments underlying the thesis?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: `search_sep.py` for "extended mind", "externalism", "functionalism"
- Key papers: Clark & Chalmers (1998), Clark (2008), follow-up works by both authors
- Search terms: ["extended mind", "extended cognition", "active externalism", "vehicle externalism", "content externalism"]
- Use `s2_search.py` with high citation filters for foundational works
- Expected papers: 15-20 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Establishes the theoretical foundation for understanding how cognition might extend beyond the brain, setting up all subsequent debates.

### Domain 2: Parity Principle and Critiques

**Focus**: The parity principle as methodological tool and its philosophical critiques

**Key Questions**:
- What exactly is the parity principle and how is it supposed to work?
- What are the major objections to the parity principle?
- Can the extended mind thesis survive rejection of the parity principle?
- What alternative principles have been proposed?

**Search Strategy**:

- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: The parity principle is central to Clark & Chalmers' argument but highly contested, making this crucial for understanding the debate's evolution.

---

### Domain 3: Coupling-Constitution Debate

**Focus**: The distinction between mere coupling to external resources versus cognitive constitution by them

**Key Questions**:
- What is the difference between causal coupling and cognitive constitution?
- How do critics use this distinction to challenge extended cognition?
- What responses have defenders offered?
- Does the coupling-constitution distinction map onto the vehicle-content distinction?

**Search Strategy**:

- Key authors: Adams & Aizawa (coupling vs. constitution), Menary (integration), Rowlands
- Search terms: ["coupling constitution", "cognitive constitution", "causal coupling", "integration challenge", "mutual manipulability"]
- Use `search_philpapers.py` with category filters for philosophy of cognitive science
- Expected papers: 12-15 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: This debate is central to whether offloading constitutes genuine cognitive extension or merely supports internal cognition.

---

### Domain 4: Cognitive Integration Approaches

**Focus**: Accounts emphasizing integration, complementarity, and transformation rather than parity

**Key Questions**:
- How do integration-based accounts differ from parity-based accounts?
- What role does complementarity play in cognitive extension?
- How do external resources transform rather than merely replicate internal processes?
- What is the relationship between integration and cognitive scaffolding?

### Domain 6: Extended Cognition and Offloading - Theoretical Intersections

**Focus**: How offloading research relates to extended mind debates; philosophical interpretations of empirical findings

**Key Questions**:
- Does cognitive offloading provide evidence for or against extended cognition?
- How do philosophers interpret offloading phenomena?
- What is the relationship between offloading strategies and cognitive extension?
- Can offloading occur without cognitive extension?

**Search Strategy**:

## Coverage Rationale

These eight domains provide comprehensive coverage by:
1. Establishing theoretical foundations (Domains 1-2)

- **Estimated papers**: 130-170 total across all domains
- **Key positions**:
  - Defenders of extended mind (Clark, Chalmers, Menary, Sutton)
  - Critics emphasizing mark of the cognitive (Adams & Aizawa, Rupert)
  - Integration theorists (Menary, Kirchhoff)
  - Empirical researchers (Risko, Gilbert, Storm, Ward)

## Notes for Researchers

**Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**:
- Start each domain with `search_sep.py` for conceptual foundations and key distinctions
- Use `search_philpapers.py` with appropriate category filters for philosophical debates
- Use `s2_search.py` for empirical work, with citation filters for highly-cited papers and --recent flag for last 5 years

- Use `search_arxiv.py` for preprints in cognitive science and AI
- Always verify citations with `verify_citation.py` before including in BibTeX

**Critical engagement priorities**:
- Domain 8 must receive equal attention to supportive literature
- Each domain should identify limitations and counterevidence

- Domain 7: Use --recent flag extensively, expect rapid development
- Domain 8: Seek out strongest objections, not just token criticism

**Bibliography richness**:
- Include abstracts for all entries when available
- Note key arguments or findings in annotations
- Flag papers that bridge multiple domains
- Mark foundational vs. recent developments
