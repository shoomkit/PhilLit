DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the theoretical relationship between cognitive offloading research and extended mind debates. A central question is whether offloading phenomena provide evidence for or against extended cognition. Some scholars argue that offloading demonstrates functional integration between agents and tools, supporting constitutive extension claims. Others contend that offloading is better explained as embedded cognition - using external resources without cognitive constitution. Recent work by Britten-Neish (2025) connects offloading to action theory, arguing that Anscombean accounts of agency support extended mind interpretations. Hutchins' distributed cognition framework (2010) provides an alternative to both internalist and extended mind approaches, emphasizing cognitive ecology. The debate increasingly focuses on degrees of integration rather than binary distinctions, with second-wave extended mind theories proposing gradient accounts of cognitive extension.

Key theoretical tensions include: the parity principle versus complementarity hypothesis, whether offloading involves genuine cognitive processes or merely causal scaffolding, and how to interpret empirical findings about strategy selection in offloading tasks. Contemporary work explores whether cognitive integration admits of degrees (Heersmink), how offloading relates to enactivism (Sganzerla et al. 2025), and whether distributed cognition provides a better framework than extended mind for understanding offloading phenomena.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how philosophers interpret empirical offloading research and whether such findings support extended mind claims. It covers debates about cognitive boundaries, functional integration criteria, and alternative frameworks for understanding mind-world coupling. These theoretical disputes shape how offloading evidence is interpreted and whether it counts as evidence for cognitive extension.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited explicit discussion of specific offloading paradigms (intention offloading, metacognitive offloading) in philosophical analyses. Few papers directly compare predictions from extended mind versus embedded cognition frameworks. Missing systematic treatment of how different offloading strategies (metamemory-based versus perceptual-motor) relate to extension claims. Eight entries marked INCOMPLETE (no abstracts available): Michaelian & Sutton (2013), Facchin & Leonetti (2024), Hardy-Vallée & Payette (2008), Spitzer (2016), Deane et al. (2017), Dodig-Crnkovic (2018), Krueger (2018), Wijermans et al. (2008).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on how different theoretical frameworks interpret the same offloading phenomena differently. Emphasize methodological debates about what counts as evidence for cognitive constitution versus mere causal influence. Track the evolution from first-wave (parity-based) to second-wave (integration-based) extended mind arguments in relation to offloading.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Extended Mind Supporters (6 papers): Offloading demonstrates cognitive constitution when integration criteria are met
- Distributed Cognition Alternatives (4 papers): Cognitive ecology framework better explains offloading without constitution claims
- Enactivist Critiques (3 papers): Extension claims neglect active sense-making processes central to cognition
- Skeptical/Embedded (3 papers): Offloading shows causal scaffolding but not cognitive constitution
- Gradient/Integration Accounts (2 papers): Degrees of cognitive integration rather than binary boundaries

  abstract = {The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on 'cognitive offloading', HEC's defenders claim that information processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is sometimes 'genuinely' cognitive. But while debates about offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of action as a kind of interface between separately constituted intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic. But while this view of agency has been popularised – most prominently by Donald Davidson – as analytic philosophy of action's 'standard story', it has come under pressure from philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe's very different account. According to this, actions express an agent's intention only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically structured worldly context. In this paper, I'll argue that HEC's supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is, they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of human agency's general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that extended cognition's treatment of cognitive offloading requires an Anscombean rather than Davidsonian action theory, where actions express intentions only within teleologically structured worldly contexts. Opposition to extended mind stems partly from implicit Davidsonian assumptions that treat intentions and bodily movements as separately constituted with action as mere interface.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the project's question about theoretical foundations by showing how metaphysical assumptions about agency shape interpretations of offloading as evidence for extended cognition. Demonstrates that action-theoretic commitments underlie extended mind debates, suggesting offloading should be understood as manifesting agency's general environmental dependence rather than exceptional cognitive extension.

  POSITION: Defends extended cognition by grounding it in Anscombean action theory, arguing offloading manifests constitutive dependence of agency on environmental structure.

  doi = {10.1007/s11229-025-04931-w},
  abstract = {Clark and Chalmers (Analysis 58:7–19, 1998) landmark paper, The Extended Mind, launched a thousand ships and changed the contours of the larger sea of theorizing about cognition. Over the past twenty-six years, it has led to intense philosophical debates about of the constitutive bounds of mind and cognition and generated multiple waves of work taking the form of various attempts to clarify and defend its core thesis. The extended mind thesis states that under certain (specialized and particular) conditions cognitive processes may be constituted by resources distributed across the brain, the body, and the environment. The extended mind thesis is part of a larger family of theoretical frameworks such as embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and various versions of enactivism (Gallagher in South J Philos 56: 421–447, 2018; Hutchins in Cognition in the wild, The MIT Press, 1995; Varela et al. in The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience, The MIT Press, 1991; Di Paolo in Topoi 28:9–21, 2009; Hutto and Myin in Radicalizing enactivism: basic minds without content, The MIT Press, 2013; Hutto and Myin in Evolving enactivism: basic minds meet content, The MIT Press, 2017). In this paper we revive and clarify the commitments of Radical Enactivism's Extensive Enactivism, compare it to alternatives, and provide new arguments and analyses for preferring it over what is on offer from other members of the extended-distributed-enactive family of positions.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Contrasts Radical Enactivism's Extensive Enactivism with extended mind thesis, arguing that while both embrace wide cognitive boundaries, enactivism better captures cognition as active sense-making rather than information processing. Extended mind focuses on functional coupling and computational role, whereas extensive enactivism emphasizes dynamic engagement and world-involving sense-making processes.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical perspective on whether extended mind framework adequately captures offloading phenomena, suggesting enactivist alternative may better explain how agents actively structure their cognitive engagements with environment. Challenges information-processing assumptions underlying much extended mind theorizing about offloading.

  POSITION: Argues for extensive enactivism over extended mind as framework for distributed cognition, emphasizing sense-making over information processing.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops cognitive ecology framework emphasizing how cognitive processes are distributed across brain, body, and environment through cultural practices and material structures. Rather than asking where cognition is located, cognitive ecology examines how cognitive ecosystems are assembled and maintained across multiple timescales, from evolutionary to interactional.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to extended mind debates by reframing questions about cognitive boundaries. Instead of asking whether external resources constitute cognition, cognitive ecology asks how cognitive systems emerge from interactions across multiple components and timescales. This framework offers different lens for interpreting offloading phenomena as ecosystem-level processes.

  POSITION: Proposes cognitive ecology as alternative to both internalism and extended mind, focusing on distributed cognitive systems rather than cognitive boundaries.

At least three fields were taking a deeply ecological approach to cognition 30 years ago: Gibson's ecological psychology, Bateson's ecology of mind, and Soviet cultural-historical activity theory. The ideas developed in those projects have now found a place in modern views of embodied, situated, distributed cognition. As cognitive theory continues to shift from units of analysis defined by inherent properties of the elements to units defined in terms of dynamic patterns of correlation across elements, the study of cognitive ecosystems will become an increasingly important part of cognitive science.},

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how memory offloading relates to extended cognition debates. Provides philosophical analysis of when external memory aids merely support versus actually constitute memory systems, examining criteria like accessibility, reliability, and integration.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether extended cognition applies to non-human animals by analyzing cases of tool use, niche construction, and environmental coupling. Argues that many animal behaviors meet functional integration criteria for extended cognition, though cognitive sophistication varies across species and contexts. Questions whether parity principle or coupling-constitution criteria better capture animal-environment cognitive integration.

  RELEVANCE: Tests extended cognition framework beyond paradigm human cases, asking whether offloading-like phenomena in animals count as cognitive extension. Animal cases provide simpler test cases without cultural scaffolding, helping isolate what functional integration requires. Findings bear on whether human offloading is genuinely distinctive or continuous with broader animal-environment coupling.

  POSITION: Defends extended cognition's applicability to animals while noting need for gradient accounts of integration rather than binary extension claims.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Clark and Chalmers' first-wave extended mind (based on parity principle) is incompatible with online intellectual virtues needed for epistemically responsible internet use. Online virtues require agents to critically evaluate and maintain their informational resources, but first-wave extension treats external resources as cognitive equals to brain processes when functionally equivalent. Proposes second-wave theories with gradient integration better accommodate virtue requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Shows tension between extended mind claims and epistemic responsibility when cognitive resources are external and potentially unreliable. This bears on offloading interpretation: if offloaded processes are genuinely cognitive, what epistemic obligations apply? Argues that gradient integration theories better capture how agents should relate to external cognitive resources.

  POSITION: Critiques first-wave extended mind using epistemological arguments, supports second-wave gradient accounts compatible with intellectual virtues.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The internet has become an ubiquitous epistemic source. However, it comes with several drawbacks. For instance, the world wide web seems to foster filter bubbles and echo chambers and includes search results that promote bias and spread misinformation. Richard Heersmink suggests online intellectual virtues to combat these epistemically detrimental effects . These are general epistemic virtues applied to the online environment based on our background knowledge of this online environment. I argue that these online intellectual virtues also demand a particular view of cognitive integration. Online intellectual virtues are incompatible with a popular conception of extended minds proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers . I suggest that if we want to hold on to both a conception of online intellectual virtues and some conception of the extended mind, we have to accept a more gradual theory of cognitive integration along the lines of second-wave theories of the extended mind .},

  number = {8},
  pages = {1727--1763},
  doi = {10.1111/cogs.12203},
  abstract = {Novel computational representations, such as simulation models of complex systems and video games for scientific discovery (Foldit, Ete RNA etc.), are dramatically changing the way discoveries emerge in science and engineering. The cognitive roles played by such computational representations in discovery are not well understood. We present a theoretical analysis of the cognitive roles such representations play, based on an ethnographic study of the building of computational models in a systems biology laboratory. Specifically, we focus on a case of model-building by an engineer that led to a remarkable discovery in basic bioscience. Accounting for such discoveries requires a distributed cognition (DC) analysis, as DC focuses on the roles played by external representations in cognitive processes. However, DC analyses by and large have not examined scientific discovery, and they mostly focus on memory offloading, particularly how the use of existing external representations changes the nature of cognitive tasks. In contrast, we study discovery processes and argue that discoveries emerge from the processes of building the computational representation. The building process integrates manipulations in imagination and in the representation, creating a coupled cognitive system of model and modeler, where the model is incorporated into the modeler's imagination. This account extends DC significantly, and we present some of the theoretical and application implications of this extended account.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends distributed cognition analysis beyond memory offloading to discovery processes, showing how building computational models creates coupled cognitive systems where external representations become integrated with imagination. Argues that DC analyses have overfocused on using existing external representations for memory offloading rather than examining how building representations generates new cognitive coupling.

  RELEVANCE: Distinguishes memory offloading from model-building as different forms of cognitive distribution, suggesting offloading research may capture only one dimension of external resource use. Shows how building activity creates tighter coupling than using pre-existing resources, bearing on questions about when external resources genuinely extend cognition versus merely support it.

  POSITION: Extends distributed cognition to encompass representational construction beyond offloading, arguing building processes create distinctive cognitive coupling.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how AI system transparency affects cognitive agency when such systems are integrated into human cognitive practices. Distinguishes different transparency dimensions (functional, procedural, epistemic) and argues that different forms of transparency matter for different aspects of cognitive agency. When AI systems function as cognitive resources through offloading, transparency requirements differ from when humans merely use AI outputs.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses how contemporary AI-based cognitive offloading differs from classical extended mind examples (notebooks, calculators) due to AI's opacity and adaptivity. Questions whether opaque AI systems can genuinely extend cognition or whether transparency is necessary for cognitive integration. Bears on project's focus on empirical offloading research involving digital technologies.

  POSITION: Analyzes agency requirements for AI-based cognitive extension, arguing transparency needs vary with integration depth and offloading type.

  abstract = {AI systems play an increasingly important role in shaping and regulating the lives of millions of human beings across the world. Calls for greater transparency from such systems have been widespread. However, there is considerable ambiguity concerning what “transparency” actually means, and therefore, what greater transparency might entail. While, according to some debates, transparency requires seeing through the artefact or device, widespread calls for transparency imply seeing into different aspects of AI systems. These two notions are in apparent tension with each other, and they are present in two lively but largely disconnected debates. In this paper, we aim to further analyse what these calls for transparency entail, and in so doing, clarify the sorts of transparency that we should want from AI systems. We do so by offering a taxonomy that classifies different notions of transparency. After a careful exploration of the different varieties of transparency, we show how this taxonomy can help us to navigate various domains of human–technology interactions, and more usefully discuss the relationship between technological transparency and human agency. We conclude by arguing that all of these different notions of transparency should be taken into account when designing more ethically adequate AI systems.},

  abstract = {The impact of the Internet across multiple aspects of modern society is clear. However, the influence that it may have on our brain structure and functioning remains a central topic of investigation. Here we draw on recent psychological, psychiatric and neuroimaging findings to examine several key hypotheses on how the Internet may be changing our cognition. Specifically, we explore how unique features of the online world may be influencing: a) attentional capacities, as the constantly evolving stream of online information encourages our divided attention across multiple media sources, at the expense of sustained concentration; b) memory processes, as this vast and ubiquitous source of online information begins to shift the way we retrieve, store, and even value knowledge; and c) social cognition, as the ability for online social settings to resemble and evoke real-world social processes creates a new interplay between the Internet and our social lives, including our self-concepts and self-esteem. Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be integrated into broader research settings to study how this unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and the brain across the life course.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews empirical evidence that Internet use alters attention, memory, and social cognition, potentially reflecting neuroplastic changes. Internet's constant information availability may shift memory strategies from storage to retrieval-based approaches, representing large-scale cognitive offloading onto digital resources. Questions whether such alterations constitute genuine cognitive changes or adaptive strategy shifts.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical perspective on widespread cognitive offloading to Internet resources, documenting how external information availability affects internal cognitive processes. Findings bear on whether Internet-based offloading supports extended cognition claims or represents concerning cognitive dependence. Shows how philosophical debates about extension connect to empirical questions about cognitive development and neuroplasticity.

  POSITION: Reviews empirical evidence for Internet-induced cognitive changes while remaining agnostic about whether these constitute extended cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops account of representational competence in science education based on distributed and embodied cognition, arguing that understanding scientific representations requires integrated activity across perceptual, motoric, and external representational systems. Competence emerges from coupled dynamics between body, brain, and external representations rather than internal mental models alone.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how distributed cognition framework applies to educational contexts involving external representations. Students' offloading of reasoning onto diagrams and models reflects not mere convenience but constitutive role of external structures in developing representational competence. Provides educational case for cognitive extension through representational coupling.

  abstract = {Multiple external representations (MERs) are central to the practice and learning of science, mathematics and engineering, as the phenomena and entities investigated and controlled in these domains are often not available for perception and action. MERs therefore play a twofold constitutive role in reasoning in these domains. Firstly, MERs stand in for the phenomena and entities that are imagined, and thus make possible scientific investigations. Secondly, related to the above, sensorimotor and imagination-based interactions with the MERs make possible focused cognitive operations involving these phenomena and entities, such as mental rotation and analogical transformations. These two constitutive roles suggest that acquiring expertise in science, mathematics and engineering requires developing the ability to transform and integrate the MERs in that field, in tandem with running operations in imagination on the phenomena and entities the MERs stand for. This core ability to integrate external and internal representations and operations on them – termed representational competence (RC) – is therefore critical to learning in science, mathematics and engineering. However, no general account of this core process is currently available. We argue that, given the above two constitutive roles played by MERs, a theoretical account of representational competence requires an explicit model of how the cognitive system interacts with external representations, and how imagination abilities develop through this process. At the applied level, this account is required to develop design guidelines for new media interventions for learning science and mathematics, particularly emerging ones that are based on embodied interactions. As a first step to developing such a theoretical account, we review the literature on learning with MERs, as well as acquiring RC, in chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and engineering, from two perspectives. First, we focus on the important theoretical accounts and related empirical studies, and examine what is common about them. Second, we summarise the major trends in each discipline, and then bring together these trends. The results show that most models and empirical studies of RC are framed within the classical information processing approach, and do not take a constitutive view of external representations. To develop an account compatible with the constitutive view of external representations, we outline an interaction-based theoretical account of RC, extending recent advances in distributed and embodied cognition.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes understanding cognition as morphological computation emerging from bodily structures processing information through self-organization. This info-computational approach integrates cognitivist and EEEE (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended) frameworks by treating cognition as complex multiscale phenomenon based on morphological information processing in evolved organisms.

  RELEVANCE: Offers computational framework for understanding cognitive distribution that bridges traditional and 4E approaches. Morphological computation perspective suggests offloading might redistribute computational work across different morphological substrates (neural, bodily, environmental) rather than extending cognition beyond brain per se.

  POSITION: Proposes morphological computation as integrative framework for understanding embodied and distributed cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reconceptualizes ecosophy through embodied cognition lens, arguing that mind-body-environment relations should be understood as integrated cognitive ecosystems. Proposes 'embodied cognitive ecosophy' that addresses criticisms of traditional ecosophy by grounding it in empirical findings about embodied and distributed cognition.

  RELEVANCE: Extends embodied and distributed cognition into environmental and ethical domains, suggesting cognitive offloading and environmental coupling have normative dimensions. Ecosophical perspective emphasizes mutual constitution of cognitive agents and environments rather than boundary questions.

  POSITION: Develops ecosophical implications of embodied cognition, emphasizing cognitive-environmental integration.

  abstract = {The concept of embodied cognition has had a major impact in a number of disciplines. The extent of its consequences on general knowledge and epistemology are still being explored. Embodied cognition in human geography has its own traditions and discourses but these have become somewhat isolated in the discipline itself. This paper argues that findings in other disciplines are of value in reconceptualizing embodied cognition in human geography and this is explored by reconsidering the concept of ecosophy. Criticisms of ecosophy as a theory are considered and recent work in embodied cognition is applied to consider how such criticisms might be addressed. An updated conceptualization is proposed, the embodied cognitive ecosophy, and three characteristics arising from this criticism and synthesis are presented with a view to inform future discussions of ecosophy and emotional geography.},

  title = {Musical Worlds and the Extended Mind},
  year = {2018},
  howpublished = {University of Exeter Repository},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies extended mind framework to music cognition, arguing that music functions as external resource affording cognitive offloading for various purposes including emotional regulation, memory enhancement, and social coordination. Music's material and worldmaking character makes it paradigm case of external scaffolding that can constitute extended cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates extended mind application to aesthetic and affective domains beyond paradigm cases of memory and reasoning. Music's role in emotional offloading and social bonding shows how external resources can scaffold diverse cognitive-affective processes, expanding understanding of what cognitive extension encompasses.

  POSITION: Defends extended mind through musical case studies, emphasizing music's role in affective and social offloading.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Overview of embodied, situated, and distributed cognition approaches for social scientists, explaining how these frameworks challenge internalist assumptions and offer new perspectives on social cognition and collective behavior. Distributed cognition especially illuminates how cognitive processes span multiple agents and artifacts in social systems.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces distributed cognition to social science audiences, suggesting offloading and cognitive distribution have social-systemic dimensions beyond individual agent-artifact coupling. Social perspective emphasizes how offloading practices are culturally shaped and collectively maintained.

  POSITION: Overview of embodied and distributed cognition for social science applications.
