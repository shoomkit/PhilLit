## Digital Technologies as Test Cases -- Smartphones, the Internet, and the Limits of Extension

Digital technologies present the most practically pressing test cases for extended cognition, bringing philosophical debates into direct contact with the cognitive tools that billions of people now use daily. Smartphones, internet access, and other digital devices combine features that seemingly support extension claims—ubiquity, information richness, rapid accessibility, personalization—with features that complicate them—attentional capture, algorithmic opacity, dynamic updating, and potential for manipulation. The empirical evidence about cognitive impacts is mixed and contested, resisting simple narratives about either seamless extension or inevitable impairment. This section examines how contemporary digital technologies function as test cases where theoretical frameworks meet empirical complexity.

### The Internet as Extended Cognitive System

Philosophical analyses of Internet-extended cognition have increasingly recognized that the Internet's distinctive features challenge traditional extended mind criteria developed for simpler technologies like notebooks and calculators. Smart (2017) provides comprehensive analysis of whether and how Internet technologies can constitute part of extended cognitive systems, examining different types of potential extension—memory extension via cloud storage, reasoning extension via search engines, knowledge extension through networked information access. He identifies the challenge of "network-extended cognitive bloat": the Internet's vast scope and networked structure make determining cognitive system boundaries particularly difficult, as any given online resource connects to virtually unlimited further resources. This boundary problem raises questions about whether Internet-based cognition can satisfy the kind of reliable coupling that Clark and Chalmers' original framework assumed.

Smart, Heersmink, and Clowes (2017) develop a "cognitive ecology" framework that treats the Internet as a transformative cognitive niche rather than simply an external tool. The Internet creates an environment characterized by information abundance, networked social interaction, and constantly evolving knowledge structures. This ecological perspective reframes the question from whether specific Internet tools extend cognition to how Internet environments reshape cognitive practices across multiple dimensions. Heersmink and Sutton (2018) argue that different online practices fit different theoretical frameworks: some web-based activities may satisfy extended mind criteria (personal cloud storage, customized information systems), others function as transactive memory systems (knowing which online sources to consult), while still others merely scaffold cognition without constituting cognitive processes. This pluralistic analysis suggests that the Internet supports multiple types of brain-environment coupling simultaneously, complicating any unified verdict about Internet-extended cognition.

Heersmink (2016) examines how Internet use affects the values that structure cognition—epistemic virtues including accuracy, speed, reliability, and understanding. He argues that while Internet search enhances speed and extends accessible knowledge, it may undermine deeper understanding and sustained critical evaluation. This normative dimension reveals that even if Internet use constitutes cognitive extension in some functional sense, we must evaluate what kind of cognition it produces. Schwengerer (2020) develops this concern into a philosophical argument: first-wave extended mind theory based on parity principles is incompatible with the intellectual virtues required for epistemically responsible Internet use. If external resources count as cognitive simply when functionally equivalent to internal processes, agents have no special epistemic obligations toward them. But responsible Internet use requires agents to critically evaluate sources, maintain informational hygiene, and actively curate their cognitive environments. Schwengerer proposes that second-wave theories emphasizing integration and gradient accounts of extension better accommodate these virtue requirements, as they preserve the distinction between coupled resources that require ongoing management and fully integrated cognitive components.

Smart, Andrada, and Clowes (2022) challenge another traditional criterion for cognitive extension: phenomenal transparency. Many extended mind theorists have suggested that external resources constitute genuine cognitive extensions only when they become experientially transparent—tools that users manipulate without conscious attention to the tool itself. Smart and colleagues argue that transparency is neither necessary nor sufficient for cognitive extension. It is not necessary because opaque tools can still play constitutive cognitive roles when appropriately integrated into cognitive practices. It is not sufficient because mere phenomenological character does not determine constitutive status. This argument opens conceptual space for non-transparent digital tools—including algorithmically opaque AI systems—to qualify as cognitive extensions when they satisfy other integration criteria.

These philosophical analyses converge on recognizing that the Internet challenges simple application of original extended mind criteria while not definitively defeating extension claims. The plurality of frameworks invoked—extended mind, transactive memory, scaffolding, cognitive ecology—suggests that the question may not be whether the Internet extends cognition but which Internet practices, under which conditions, involve which forms of cognitive distribution.

### Smartphones, Brain Drain, and the Contested Evidence

The "brain drain" hypothesis, introduced by Ward et al. (2017), claims that smartphone presence alone reduces available cognitive capacity. Across two experiments, Ward and colleagues found that participants performed worse on measures of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence when smartphones were present on the desk versus placed in another room, even when phones were turned off and participants were not using them. The effect was strongest for individuals high in smartphone dependence. Ward et al. attributed this to automatic attentional processes: the phone's mere presence consumes attentional resources as individuals actively suppress the impulse to attend to it, draining capacity available for other cognitive tasks. This finding directly challenges optimistic accounts of smartphones as seamless cognitive extensions, suggesting they may function as cognitive distractors rather than integrated tools.

However, subsequent replication attempts have yielded inconsistent results. Ruiz Pardo and Minda (2022) conducted a pre-registered direct replication of Ward et al.'s Experiment 2 using identical methods but found no significant differences in cognitive performance based on smartphone proximity or power state. The failure to replicate the brain drain effect raised questions about the robustness of the original findings and the conditions under which smartphone presence affects cognition. Hartmann et al. (2020) similarly found no evidence that smartphone presence affected short-term or prospective memory performance, suggesting brain drain effects may not generalize across all cognitive domains.

Two recent meta-analyses provide quantitative synthesis of the accumulated evidence, yielding partially divergent assessments. Böttger et al. (2023) analyzed 22 studies and found a significant overall negative effect of smartphone presence on cognitive performance across memory, attention, and general cognitive tasks. However, they documented substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes, varying by cognitive domain and participant nationality, suggesting moderating factors not yet fully understood. Parry (2023) conducted a more comprehensive meta-analysis of 56 studies (n=7,093) and found limited support for the brain drain hypothesis. Only working memory capacity showed a statistically significant negative effect of smartphone presence; sustained attention, response inhibition, and fluid intelligence showed null effects. Parry's analysis also revealed substantial methodological heterogeneity across studies and generally poor statistical power, limiting confidence in the evidence base. The meta-analytic evidence thus suggests that if brain drain effects exist, they are domain-specific (primarily affecting working memory), smaller than originally claimed, and moderated by factors not yet systematically identified.

Firth et al. (2019) provide broader context by reviewing neuroimaging and psychological research on how Internet use affects cognition across three domains: attention, memory, and social cognition. They find evidence that constant information streams encourage divided attention at the expense of sustained concentration; that Internet availability shifts memory strategies from internal storage to retrieval-focused approaches (consistent with the Google effect documented by Sparrow et al. 2011); and that online social interaction creates unique dynamics affecting self-concept and social processing. The review suggests both acute and sustained cognitive alterations may occur with Internet use, though distinguishing adaptive reorganization from cognitive impairment remains difficult. Age-dependent effects complicate the picture further: youth may show different trajectories than elderly populations, with implications for development versus decline.

The contested empirical evidence about smartphone impacts complicates both pro-extension and anti-extension philosophical positions. If smartphones do not reliably drain cognitive resources, concerns that they function as cognitive distractors rather than extensions are weakened. But if effects are domain-specific and context-dependent—affecting working memory but not attention, appearing under some task conditions but not others—this suggests the relationship between smartphones and cognition is more complex than either seamless extension or inevitable impairment. The replication difficulties and methodological heterogeneity highlight how philosophical debates depend on empirical findings whose robustness is still being established. The heterogeneity also suggests that unified philosophical accounts may oversimplify: smartphones may extend cognition for some purposes, impair it for others, and have neutral effects in still other contexts, depending on individual differences, task demands, and usage patterns.

### Normative Concerns and the Question of Autonomy

Recent work extends beyond descriptive questions about whether digital technologies extend cognition to normative questions about cognitive autonomy and agency. Padalko (2025) argues that Internet of Things (IoT) environments fundamentally reconfigure cognitive practice by embedding cognition within algorithmic and service-based systems, reducing epistemic autonomy and deepening platform dependency. In IoT environments, cognitive processes become distributed not just across devices users control but across networked systems that operate through algorithmic mediation and automated protocols. Padalko introduces the concept of "Homo connectus"—a socio-technical form of subjectivity shaped by platform dependency, algorithmic meaning production, and reduced reflective decision-making. The Autonomy-Enabling Ratio (AER) is proposed as a metric for assessing the extent of cognitive autonomy within connected environments, capturing the ratio between autonomous and externally regulated scenarios of knowledge and decision-making.

Andrada, Clowes, and Smart (2022) examine how AI system opacity affects cognitive agency when such systems are integrated into human cognitive practices. They distinguish different dimensions of transparency—functional, procedural, epistemic—and argue that different forms matter for different aspects of cognitive agency. When AI systems function as cognitive resources through offloading, transparency requirements differ from when humans merely use AI outputs. The analysis reveals tensions between the extended mind framework's emphasis on functional integration and the normative requirements for maintaining human agency within AI-augmented cognitive systems. If external cognitive resources are algorithmically opaque and adaptively changing, agents may lose the kind of understanding and control required for cognitive self-determination even when such resources enhance functional performance.

These normative concerns suggest that even if digital technologies can constitute cognitive extensions in some functional sense, widespread offloading to opaque, algorithmically-mediated systems raises distinct questions about cognitive autonomy. The concern is not simply whether minds extend into smartphones and Internet platforms but whether such extension involves forms of cognitive dependence that undermine rather than enhance human cognitive agency. Soldatova and Ilyukhina (2025) address related questions about maintaining integrated subjectivity when cognitive processes distribute across multiple digital spaces and platforms. As individuals distribute cognitive work across numerous devices, applications, and online platforms, maintaining coherent selfhood becomes a practical challenge requiring active management and integration work.

These analyses reveal that digital technologies present challenges for extended cognition theories precisely because they combine cognitive enhancement with potential threats to autonomy. Unlike Otto's notebook—which Otto controls, understands, and maintains—contemporary digital cognitive tools often operate through mechanisms users do not understand, under terms they do not control, pursuing optimization functions they have not specified. This asymmetry between functional integration and agential control complicates philosophical accounts that treat cognitive extension as inherently beneficial or that assume tightly coupled systems are necessarily well-integrated from the agent's perspective.

The empirical and philosophical literature on digital technologies thus resists simple conclusions. The Internet may extend cognition under some conditions while scaffolding or impairing it under others. Smartphones may drain cognitive resources in some domains but not others, for some individuals but not others. Digital cognitive tools may enhance functional performance while reducing cognitive autonomy. These mixed findings call for domain-specific, context-sensitive analysis rather than unified verdicts about digital cognitive extension. They also suggest that the relationship between humans and their digital cognitive tools involves ongoing negotiation and active management rather than stable, seamless integration.
