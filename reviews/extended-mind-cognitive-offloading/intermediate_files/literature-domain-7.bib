DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how smartphones, internet access, and other digital technologies function as extended cognitive systems. The central debates concern whether these technologies genuinely constitute cognitive extension or merely causal support for cognition, and what empirical evidence reveals about their cognitive impacts. Ward et al.'s (2017) "brain drain" hypothesis suggests that smartphone presence alone reduces available cognitive capacity, sparking considerable empirical investigation. Meanwhile, philosophical work by Smart, Clowes, and Heersmink explores how the Internet's unique properties—ubiquity, vast information scope, and dynamic updating—challenge traditional extended mind criteria. Recent research increasingly focuses on the "Google effect" (Sparrow et al., 2011) whereby internet access transforms memory practices, shifting from internal storage to knowing where to find information. The domain also encompasses debates about digital versus analog tools, the role of social media platforms in cognitive processes, and whether smartphone-mediated cognition differs fundamentally from other forms of cognitive offloading.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how contemporary digital technologies instantiate or challenge extended mind theory. The smartphone provides a paradigmatic case study for testing Clark and Chalmers' criteria, while empirical research on cognitive impacts illuminates the practical consequences of widespread cognitive offloading. The tension between enabling and impairing effects of digital tools is central to understanding both philosophical foundations and real-world manifestations of extended cognition.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the brain drain effect has received substantial empirical attention, less work examines how smartphone design features interact with individual differences to produce cognitive extension versus mere distraction. The philosophical literature on Internet-extended mind tends to focus on epistemological questions (extended knowledge) while relatively neglecting other cognitive domains like decision-making, emotional regulation, or creative thinking. Cross-cultural variation in digital tool use and its cognitive consequences remains under-explored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, highlight the interplay between philosophical theorizing about extended cognition and empirical investigations of digital technology impacts. The replication debates around the brain drain effect illustrate broader methodological challenges in studying technology-mediated cognition. Consider how the rapid evolution of digital technologies complicates both philosophical analysis and empirical study.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ward and colleagues present the "brain drain hypothesis," arguing that smartphones consume attentional resources even when not in use. Across two experiments, participants performed worse on measures of available working memory capacity and fluid intelligence when smartphones were present (on desk) versus absent (in another room), even with phones turned off. The effect was strongest for high smartphone-dependent individuals, suggesting automatic attentional processes directed toward the phone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides empirical evidence that smartphone presence may undermine the very cognitive resources required for their use as extended cognitive tools. The findings challenge optimistic accounts of smartphones as seamless cognitive extensions by suggesting they impose cognitive costs through attentional capture. The research connects to broader questions about when external resources enhance versus impair cognition, and whether constant availability is compatible with genuine cognitive extension.

  POSITION: Empirical psychology showing negative cognitive impacts of smartphone proximity, challenging seamless integration assumptions in extended mind theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sparrow et al. demonstrate that internet access fundamentally alters memory encoding and retrieval strategies. When participants knew information would be accessible later, they remembered where to find it better than the information itself. The studies show people are becoming dependent on external sources as a form of transactive memory, using the internet as a cognitive tool to offload information storage while retaining metamemory about information location.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper empirically validates key predictions of extended mind theory regarding memory transformation through tool use. The "Google effect" shows how ubiquitous internet access can restructure cognitive practices from internal storage to external access, paralleling how Otto's notebook functioned in Clark and Chalmers' original extended mind example. The research raises questions about whether this cognitive restructuring constitutes genuine cognitive extension or problematic dependence.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart, Heersmink, and Clowes develop a "cognitive ecology" framework for understanding how the Internet transforms cognitive practices and environments. They argue the Internet creates a unique cognitive niche characterized by information abundance, networked social interactions, and constantly evolving knowledge structures. The chapter examines how web technologies enable new forms of distributed cognition, collaborative knowledge production, and cognitive niche construction while also introducing novel forms of cognitive risk.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides comprehensive philosophical analysis of Internet-specific features relevant to extended cognition debates. Unlike generic information tools, the Internet's networked, dynamic, and socially embedded nature raises distinct questions about cognitive coupling, reliability, and the boundaries of cognitive systems. The ecological perspective helps frame how digital environments shape rather than merely support cognitive processes.

  POSITION: Philosophical framework treating the Internet as a transformative cognitive ecology that fundamentally reshapes human cognitive practices.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart provides a comprehensive philosophical analysis of Internet-extended cognition, examining whether and how Internet technologies can constitute part of extended cognitive systems. He distinguishes between different types of Internet-based cognitive extension (e.g., memory extension via cloud storage vs. reasoning extension via search engines) and evaluates them against established criteria for cognitive extension. The paper introduces concerns about "network-extended cognitive bloat" where the boundaries of cognitive systems become unclear.

  RELEVANCE: This paper systematically applies extended mind theory to Internet technologies, identifying both promising cases and potential problems. Smart's analysis helps clarify which Internet-based practices might qualify as genuine cognitive extension versus mere tool use. His discussion of cognitive bloat and boundary problems directly addresses challenges the Internet poses for traditional extended mind criteria, particularly the coupling-constitution distinction.

  POSITION: Cautiously optimistic philosophical analysis arguing Internet can support cognitive extension while identifying novel theoretical challenges.

  abstract = {The Internet is an important focus of attention for those concerned with issues of extended cognition. In particular, the application of active externalist theorizing to the Internet gives rise to the notion of Internet-extended cognition: the idea that the Internet can (on occasion) form part of an integrated nexus of material elements that serves as the realization base for human mental states and processes. The current review attempts to survey a range of issues and controversies that arise in respect of the notion of Internet-extended cognition. These include the issue of whether the Internet, as a technological system, is able to support real-world cases of cognitive extension. It also includes issues concerning the cognitive and epistemic impacts of the Internet. Finally, the review highlights a range of issues and concerns that have not been the focus of previous philosophical attention. These include issues of ‘network-extended cognitive bloat’, ‘conjoined minds’, and an entirely new form of cognitive extension that goes under the heading of ‘human-extended machine cognition’. Together, these issues serve to highlight the value and importance of Internet-extended cognition to contemporary philosophical debates about the extended mind. In particular, the notion of Internet-extended cognition has the potential to highlight points of philosophical progress that are not easily revealed by the kind of technologically low-grade cases that tend to animate the majority of philosophical discussions in this area.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Firth and colleagues synthesize neuroimaging and psychological research on how Internet use affects cognition across three domains: attention, memory, and social cognition. They find evidence that constant information streams encourage divided attention at the expense of sustained concentration; that Internet availability shifts memory strategies from storage to retrieval of access pathways; and that online social interaction creates unique dynamics affecting self-concept and social processing. The review suggests both acute and sustained cognitive alterations may occur.

  RELEVANCE: This interdisciplinary review connects neuroscientific evidence to philosophical questions about Internet-mediated cognition. The findings on altered attentional patterns and memory strategies provide empirical grounding for debates about whether Internet access enhances or undermines cognitive capacities. The discussion of age-dependent effects (youth versus elderly) raises important questions about developmental trajectories in digitally-mediated cognitive environments.

  abstract = {The impact of the Internet across multiple aspects of modern society is clear. However, the influence that it may have on our brain structure and functioning remains a central topic of investigation. Here we draw on recent psychological, psychiatric and neuroimaging findings to examine several key hypotheses on how the Internet may be changing our cognition. Specifically, we explore how unique features of the online world may be influencing: a) attentional capacities, as the constantly evolving stream of online information encourages our divided attention across multiple media sources, at the expense of sustained concentration; b) memory processes, as this vast and ubiquitous source of online information begins to shift the way we retrieve, store, and even value knowledge; and c) social cognition, as the ability for online social settings to resemble and evoke real‐world social processes creates a new interplay between the Internet and our social lives, including our self‐concepts and self‐esteem. Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be integrated into broader research settings to study how this unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and the brain across the life course.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Heersmink examines how Internet use affects the values that structure human cognition—what he terms "epistemic virtues" including accuracy, speed, reliability, and understanding. He argues that while Internet search enhances speed and extends accessible knowledge, it may undermine deeper understanding and critical evaluation. The paper develops a normative framework for assessing cognitive enhancement claims by examining trade-offs between different cognitive values.

  RELEVANCE: This work moves beyond descriptive questions (does Internet qualify as extended cognition?) to normative evaluation (what kind of cognition does it produce?). Heersmink's values-based approach helps address the project's concern with distinguishing beneficial from problematic forms of cognitive offloading. His analysis shows that even if Internet use constitutes cognitive extension, we must evaluate what cognitive capacities it develops versus atrophies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This pre-registered direct replication of Ward et al.'s (2017) Experiment 2 failed to reproduce the brain drain effect. Using identical methods (smartphone location manipulation, working memory and attention tasks), Ruiz Pardo and Minda found no significant differences in cognitive performance based on smartphone proximity or power state. The results suggest that mere smartphone presence may not consistently impair cognitive capacity as originally claimed.

  RELEVANCE: This failed replication raises important methodological questions about smartphone-cognition research and the robustness of empirical claims informing philosophical debates. The null findings complicate optimistic interpretations that smartphones seamlessly extend cognition as well as pessimistic claims about their inevitable cognitive costs. The replication crisis in psychology has direct implications for how philosophers should weight empirical evidence in extended mind debates.

  abstract = {The present study was a pre-registered direct replication of Ward et al.'s (2017) second experiment (OSF pre-registration found at: https://osf.io/5fq4r). This replication assigned both smartphone location (on desk, in pocket/bag, or outside of the testing room) and smartphone power (on, or off) for a total of six conditions. Participants completed an automated operation span (OSpan) task, a Cue-Dependent Go/No-Go task, and the smartphone attachment and dependency inventory. It was hypothesized that performance on an attention-demanding task (i.e., the OSpan task) would be worse for those in closer proximity to their smartphone (on desk) and that those with greater smartphone attachment and dependency would have a larger "brain drain" effect. Using the same tasks and conditions as in Ward et al.'s (2017) second experiment, the present study found that the "brain drain" effect did not replicate: there was no difference between smartphone location conditions on performance on either the o-span task or the go/no-go task. These findings demonstrate that the mere presence of one's smartphone may not be enough to affect cognitive performance. Understanding these effects is crucial in a time where smartphones are a basic necessity.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Böttger and colleagues conduct a meta-analysis of 22 studies (43 effects) examining smartphone presence and cognitive performance. They find a significant overall negative effect across memory, attention, and general cognitive performance domains. However, subgroup analyses reveal substantial heterogeneity, with effect sizes varying by cognitive domain and participant nationality. The findings suggest smartphone distraction effects exist but are moderated by individual and contextual factors.

  RELEVANCE: This meta-analysis provides quantitative synthesis of the empirical literature on smartphone-cognition relationships, helping adjudicate between Ward's original claims and subsequent failed replications. The documented heterogeneity suggests the relationship between smartphone presence and cognitive performance is complex and context-dependent, complicating simple narratives about digital tools as either enhancing or impairing cognition.

  abstract = {Smartphones have become an indispensable part of everyday life. Given the current debate about the use of smartphones in classrooms and schools, it seems appropriate to examine their effects on aspects of cognitive performance in more detail. Ward and colleagues not only demonstrated the negative effect of smartphones on cognitive performance but also showed that the mere presence of these devices can have this effect—this is known as the Brain Drain effect. In the present article, a meta-analytic approach was adopted in order to verify these findings. Here we show a significant overall negative effect of smartphone use and presence. In a database search we identified 22 studies with a total of 43 relevant effects that could be assigned to the categories “memory”, “attention”, and “general cognitive performance”. A subgroup analysis suggests that not all cognitive domains are equally affected by the negative effect of smartphones. The heterogeneity of the effects reinforces this finding. The nationality of the test subjects or the origin of the studies was identified as a further key variable. Our findings also indicate that the distracting effect of smartphones varies on the area studies and further research is necessary. In view of the present research results, it seems important that people in general, and especially children and adolescents in schools and classrooms, learn how to deal with the distracting potential of smartphones.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Parry's systematic review and meta-analysis (56 studies, n=7093) finds limited support for the brain drain hypothesis. Working memory capacity showed the only statistically significant negative effect of smartphone presence, while sustained attention, response inhibition, and fluid intelligence showed null effects. The analysis reveals substantial methodological heterogeneity and generally poor statistical power across studies, limiting confidence in the evidence base.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive meta-analysis provides the most thorough quantitative assessment of brain drain research to date. The mixed findings—some support for working memory effects but not other domains—suggest smartphone impacts may be more domain-specific than Ward et al. originally claimed. The methodological critique raises important questions about research quality in this rapidly growing field.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A growing body of research investigates the general possibility that the mere presence of a smartphone might negatively impact cognitive performance, with some researchers posing the “brain drain” hypothesis which posits that smartphone presence will impair working memory capacity and fluid intelligence, but not sustained attention and response inhibition. To assess the strength of evidence for the claim that the mere presence of a smartphone can negatively impact cognitive performance, this study reports a systematic review and six meta-analyses (k = 56, n = 7093). Across cognitive functions, only a single statistically significant pooled effect was found. Working memory capacity was negatively impacted by the mere presence of a smartphone, while results for the remaining cognitive functions produced null summary effects. The analysis also finds that there is substantial methodological heterogeneity and generally poor statistical power in the domain. Overall, while the current meta-analysis provides limited support for a negative albeit smaller than theorized brain drain effect due to the mere presence of a smartphone, given methodological concerns, the extent to which the current body of literature can support or refute the hypothesis is limited.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart, Andrada, and Clowes argue that phenomenal transparency—the experiential quality of tools seeming to disappear during skilled use—is neither necessary nor sufficient for cognitive extension. They challenge proposals that transparency serves as a criterion for distinguishing genuine cognitive extension from mere tool use. Instead, transparency is a feature of situations supporting certain dispositional cognitive property ascriptions. The paper reframes transparency's role in extended mind debates.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis addresses a key criterion often invoked in evaluating whether smartphones and Internet qualify as extended cognitive systems. If transparency is required for extension, then attention-capturing digital tools would fail to qualify. Smart et al.'s argument that transparency is not necessary opens space for arguing that even non-transparent digital tools can constitute cognitive extension when appropriately integrated into cognitive practices.

  abstract = {Proponents of the extended mind have suggested that phenomenal transparency may be important to the way we evaluate putative cases of cognitive extension. In particular, it has been suggested that in order for a bio-external resource to count as part of the machinery of the mind, it must qualify as a form of transparent equipment or transparent technology. The present paper challenges this claim. It also challenges the idea that phenomenological properties can be used to settle disputes regarding the constitutional (versus merely causal) status of bio-external resources in episodes of extended cognizing. Rather than regard phenomenal transparency as a criterion for cognitive extension, we suggest that transparency is a feature of situations that support the ascription of certain cognitive/mental dispositional properties to both ourselves and others. By directing attention to the forces and factors that motivate disposition ascriptions, we arrive at a clearer picture of the role of transparency in arguments for extended cognition and the extended mind. As it turns out, transparency is neither necessary nor sufficient for cognitive extension, but this does not mean that it is entirely irrelevant to our understanding of the circumstances in which episodes of extended cognizing are apt to arise.},

Beyond this, however, the paper is intended to support the philosophical effort to understand the notions of extended knowledge and the extended mind.

  abstract = {This article offers a philosophical investigation of how the Internet of Things (IoT) reconfigures cognitive practice, reshaping the structure of knowledge, decision-making, and subjectivity in the digital environment. It demonstrates that IoT is not merely a technological infrastructure but a mechanism that embeds cognition within algorithmic and service-based systems, reducing epistemic autonomy and deepening dependence on platforms and automated protocols. The study conceptualizes Homo connectus as a new socio-technical form of subjectivity shaped by platform dependency, technical mediation of action, algorithmic production of meaning, and systemic constraints on reflective decision-making. These transformations affect education, knowledge production, and professional competence by introducing structural reliance on service ecosystems and reducing individual cognitive sovereignty. To analyze these dynamics, the article introduces the Autonomy-Enabling Ratio (AER), a novel metric for assessing the extent of cognitive autonomy within connected environments. AER captures the ratio between autonomous and externally regulated scenarios of knowledge, education, and professional practice, providing a tool to identify algorithmic overreach and the erosion of human agency. This work contributes to philosophical discourse by framing IoT as both a technical and epistemic phenomenon, critically examining its implications for human autonomy, meaning-making, and social interaction in the context of pervasive digital infrastructures.},

Contrary to Ward et al.'s findings, they found no evidence that smartphone presence (visible, in bag, or outside room) affected memory performance. The null results held regardless of smartphone dependency levels. The study suggests brain drain effects may not generalize across all cognitive domains or task types.

  RELEVANCE: This null finding adds to growing evidence that brain drain effects are less robust and more context-dependent than initially claimed. The domain-specificity of effects raises questions about which cognitive processes are susceptible to smartphone-related distraction and under what conditions. For extended mind theory, it suggests proximity alone may not determine whether devices function as cognitive extensions or distractors.

  POSITION: Null findings challenging generalizability of brain drain hypothesis to memory tasks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Baeva examines how digitalization transforms dialogue in educational contexts, affecting cognitive, social, and existential dimensions. She argues that while digital dialogue enables access and efficiency, it can promote isolation rather than integration, altering the nature of learning. The analysis distinguishes between digital tools that scaffold genuine dialogue versus those that merely facilitate information transmission.

  RELEVANCE: This educational perspective highlights how digital mediation affects intersubjective cognitive processes often neglected in individualistic extended mind accounts. The focus on dialogue quality rather than individual cognitive capacity raises questions about when digital tools support versus undermine socially extended cognitive processes. The educational context provides concrete examples of digitally-mediated collaborative cognition.

  POSITION: Critical analysis of digital dialogue in education, highlighting risks of isolation despite connectivity.

  abstract = {Digitalization of socio-cultural phenomena, including the education system, generates transformations of their qualitative characteristics and parameters, which requires research from the standpoint of methodological analysis and assessment of their possible consequences on humans and society. A significant element of the digital environment, in general, and educational, in particular, is the dialogue, the role of which has both cognitive and ideological, existential, social aspects. The purpose of the research is a philosophical analysis of the digital transformation of dialogue in the context of the educational process, an assessment of its potential and impact on the individual. The research methodology has a complex, interdisciplinary character and is associated with the application of an existential approach to understanding the essence of dialogue (M. Bakhtin, M. Buber, G. Marcel, E. Levinas), the theory of the development of individual thinking by L.S. Vygotsky, developed by the author of the theories of electronic (digital) culture and based on modern developments in the field of the introduction of digital tools in education. The study shows that dialogue in the digital learning environment becomes not so much a form of rapprochement, integration of subjects, as a form of autonomy, isolation, individuals, which changes the nature of learning and has social and existential consequences. This creates the need to transform the digital learning environment when using it from the position of supplementing it with ethical, socio-psychological and emotional components and support tools for the student. Based on the existential-axiological analysis, the positive and risky features of digital dialogue as one of the phenomena of electronic culture and online learning tools are revealed. The concept of digital dialogue in learning, the characteristics of its features, functions, role and influence on the learner in the digital environment are presented. The difficulties of dialogic learning characteristic of the digital environment are revealed, recommendations of a methodological and methodical nature for application in the education system are presented.},

  doi = {10.22148/001c.121866},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Windhager and Mayr argue that digital humanities tools exemplify distributed cognition in practice, yet often lack explicit theoretical grounding. They propose that extended mind and distributed cognition theories provide productive frameworks for understanding how visualization tools and computational methods extend humanistic inquiry. The paper bridges philosophical theorizing about extended cognition with practical tool design in digital humanities.

  RELEVANCE: This application of extended mind theory to digital humanities tools illustrates how cognitive extension operates in knowledge work contexts. The focus on visualization as cognitive extension highlights non-linguistic forms of digitally-mediated cognition. The case demonstrates how theoretical frameworks from philosophy can inform practical tool design while being refined through application.

  POSITION: Application of distributed cognition theory to digital humanities, bridging theory and practice.

  abstract = {Digital humanists have often been criticized as too technology-driven and for a lack of theoretical work. In this paper, we discuss theories from Cognitive Science on the extended mind, which provide a productive framework to theorize the use of tools and technologies for the sake of cognitive self-enhancement. Viewed through this lens, humans continuously self-amplify their natural cognitive resources and processes by extending and offloading them to interactions with artifacts and other individuals in their environment. Concepts of extended cognition further sharpen the focus on multiple types of distribution: from the outlined internal-external distribution to the propositional-visual distribution of cognition, but also for the multi-instrumental distribution across multiple types of tools and tool specialist. All these aspects are relevant for future debates about a “theory gap” in the digital humanities: DH mainly builds external, technological tools, while traditional humanities develop conceptual tools—including theories—to enable and enhance the study of complex cultural phenomena. Notwithstanding the value of confrontational discussions, we argue for the benefits of understanding the strengths and limitations of instruments on both sides—and for working toward future synergies and ecologies of the humanities’ tools and minds. In this regard, we show how visualization-based DH tools might might play a major role in closing the comprehensibility gap of traditional theories in the arts and humanities.},

  doi = {10.21146/2413-9084-2025-30-2-33-45},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Leshkevich examines cognitive technosymbiosis—the deep integration of human cognition with AI systems—and explores whether AI exhibits "subject-like" qualities. She warns against cognitive technodependence and "lazy brain" effects where reliance on ready-made AI solutions undermines independent thinking. The analysis distinguishes productive cognitive integration from problematic dependence, emphasizing reflexive comprehension and value-purpose imperatives.

  RELEVANCE: This work extends extended mind debates to AI-augmented cognition, where the external resource itself has computational capabilities. Leshkevich's concern with maintaining human agency and independent thought within symbiotic systems addresses normative questions about desirable forms of cognitive extension. The distinction between technosymbiosis and technodependence parallels debates about genuine extension versus mere causal support.

  POSITION: Critical analysis of AI-human cognitive integration, warning against technodependence while acknowledging symbiotic potential.

  abstract = {The article aims to understand the ambivalent effects of cognitive techno-symbiosis. The is­sue of cognitive technodependence is discussed. Conceptual thinking is opposed to “think­ing with technology” with the dominance of an obligatory set of digital functions and the ef­fect of “lazy brain”, when due to the habit of ready-made solutions a person loses the ability for independent mental search. A critical analysis of conceptual alignment in human-AI interactions is proposed based on a set of unambiguous concepts, which implies standardization and formalization of human thinking. The multifunctionality of the cognitive is shown, and the problem of cognitive inequality is analyzed. The focus is on the indirect signs of subjectivity of Artificial neural network, their autonomous and voluntary functioning, their capacity for self-learning and re-training, as well as the process of reprogramming they demonstrate. The author comes to conclusions about the importance of integrating the hu­man body and a high-tech machine, i.e. a brain computer interface; about the potential of cognitive techno-symbiosis based on the bionic approach. It is shown that the function­ing of Chat GPT, which tends to become a common technological option, makes it neces­sary to identify social shock absorbers. It is important to understand the role of Chat GPT as a tool, which should be subordinated to reflexive comprehension and value-purpose im­peratives of human-centered existence.},

  doi = {10.61093/bel.9(1).109-126.2025},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Mujtaba examines ethical challenges at the human-AI intersection in data-driven environments, drawing parallels between current AI anxieties and historical responses to the internet. The analysis emphasizes that while AI (like the internet before it) raises concerns about cognitive impacts, misinformation, and bias, it also promises productivity gains and enhanced capabilities. The paper argues for balanced governance that addresses risks without stifling innovation.

  RELEVANCE: This business ethics perspective highlights practical implications of AI-augmented cognition in professional contexts. The historical parallel with internet adoption suggests current debates about AI's cognitive impacts may follow similar trajectories as earlier technology debates. The governance focus raises questions about institutional and policy responses to digitally-extended cognitive systems.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), in this data-driven digital world, is revolutionizing modern life with far-reaching implications for individuals, teams, organizations, and society. Using comments from 126 undergraduate students in South Florida, this theoretical paper highlights concepts and concerns regarding AI challenges related to cheating, plagiarizing, and biased information. The worries about the impact of AI are analogous to what the internet was three decades ago. People were using the internet as it was being developed, fine-tuned, and improved; it felt like walking over a long and tall bridge as it was being built, and the same is true for the growth of AI. Drawing parallels with the internet’s transformative impact over the past three decades, this paper emphasizes that AI is poised to drive similar positive changes, fostering increased productivity, transparency, accountability, and ethics, but at a much faster pace. In the meantime, due to the availability of data and digital content, the virtual world increased misinformation, disinformation, bias, and prejudiced speech, which AI can easily exacerbate. While AI adoption may cause process-related disruptions, its integration into everyone’s daily life is inevitable. As a natural extension of the information superhighway, AI will usher in a new wave of innovation, ultimately and perpetually transforming the fabric of our personal and professional lives. Drawing on literature and recent trends forecasted by experts, this theoretical manuscript provides an overview of AI uses, its history, challenges, and ethical implications for us all. The conceptual paper ends with recommendations for educators, managers, entrepreneurs, and human resources professionals to create awareness regarding the benefits of this new endemic technology, to ease people’s anxiety, and to reduce or mitigate hallucinations so AI tools can be used to enhance everyone’s effectiveness and efficiency.},
