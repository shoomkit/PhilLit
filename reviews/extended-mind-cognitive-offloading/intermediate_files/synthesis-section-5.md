## Critical Perspectives -- Alternative Frameworks and Unresolved Tensions

The extended mind thesis faces challenges not only from internalist critics but from alternative frameworks that reconceptualize the phenomena, methodological concerns about empirical tractability, and normative worries about cognitive autonomy. These challenges do not necessarily defeat the extended mind thesis but highlight that the question of cognitive extension is more complex than the original parity formulation suggested.

### Enactivist and Predictive Processing Alternatives

Radical enactivism offers a fundamental challenge to the entire framing of the extended mind debate. Hutto and Myin (2013) defend "radical enactivism" (REC)—the view that basic cognition involves no content or representation whatsoever. On this account, the extended mind debate presupposes contentful mental states and merely argues about their location, leaving fundamental problems about content naturalization unaddressed. Basic minds (perception, action, simple learning) operate through direct engagement with affordances and sensorimotor contingencies without representational content, which emerges only through sociocultural practices like language. If radical enactivism is correct, many phenomena labeled "cognitive offloading" may not involve offloading representational content at all, but rather reconfiguring sensorimotor engagements. The offloading metaphor itself may presuppose discredited representationalist assumptions about cognition.

The enactivist critique extends beyond representation. Di Paolo (2008) argues that extended mind does not go far enough in breaking with cognitivist assumptions, proposing instead an "extended life" framework grounded in autopoietic enactivism: cognitive processes are sense-making activities of autonomous living systems, which are constitutively open to their environment. Extended mind preserves problematic internalist assumptions while merely relocating them. Sganzerla, Hutto, and Kirchhoff (2025) develop extensive enactivism as an alternative emphasizing sensorimotor engagement over information processing. While both extensive enactivism and extended mind embrace wide cognitive boundaries, enactivism better captures cognition as active sense-making rather than information processing. This suggests that offloading research may be asking the wrong question. Rather than "does offloading extend cognition?", enactivists would ask "how does offloading transform sense-making?"

Predictive processing offers a different alternative framework with contested implications for extended cognition. Clark (2013) argues that prediction error minimization naturally supports extended mind through active inference: brains are hierarchical prediction machines that minimize prediction error through cascading top-down predictions and bottom-up error signals, and this framework extends to action—acting on the environment to make predictions come true. External resources can participate in prediction error minimization loops, supporting cognitive extension. However, Hohwy (2016) argues that the evidentiary boundary at sensory surfaces creates principled cognitive boundaries, making predictive processing internalist rather than externalist. The brain's task is to infer hidden causes of sensory input from behind this "evidentiary boundary"—prediction error minimization mechanisms are internal to this boundary, while the external world is what predictions are about. Action changes sensory input but remains external to the prediction-generating system. Fabry (2017) mediates between these positions, arguing for explanatory pluralism where different cognitive phenomena require different boundary placements. Hohwy's evidentiary boundary is descriptively accurate for some cognitive processes but not explanatorily exhaustive, and bodily and environmental dynamics contribute to prediction error minimization in ways that transcend sensory boundaries.

For offloading research, the predictive processing debate suggests reframing: offloading as strategic manipulation of environment to reduce prediction error or computational load of prediction generation. Whether external resources that generate prediction errors count as outside the cognitive system (Hohwy) or as participating in error minimization (Clark) matters for interpreting offloading phenomena. The disagreement mirrors the larger extended mind debate about individuation criteria, showing how theoretical frameworks shape interpretation of the same empirical evidence.

Britten-Neish (2025) adds an action-theoretic dimension, arguing that the extended mind debate requires an Anscombean rather than Davidsonian action theory. Opposition to extended mind stems partly from implicit Davidsonian assumptions that treat intentions and bodily movements as separately constituted with action as mere interface. On an Anscombean account, actions express intentions only within teleologically structured worldly contexts, and cognitive offloading manifests agency's general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting. This suggests that debates about offloading as evidence for extended cognition depend on prior commitments about the nature of agency and action that often go unexamined.

### Methodological Concerns and the Question of Cognitive Autonomy

Extended cognition faces methodological challenges about individuating cognitive systems and making the thesis empirically tractable. De Brigard (2017) raises the dynamic boundary problem: if cognitive systems are individuated by coupling relations, then cognitive system boundaries constantly shift as agents couple and decouple from external resources. This creates instability in what counts as "the" cognitive system and makes extended systems incompatible with treating cognitive systems as stable units for scientific investigation. Internal systems by contrast have principled boundaries (organismal boundaries) that remain stable through environmental interactions.

Bukow (2013) argues that 4E approaches (embodied, embedded, extended, enacted) lack principled stop-criteria for determining what counts as part of the cognitive system. Intrinsic property criteria (marks of the cognitive) face indeterminacy or circularity. Extrinsic property criteria (reliability, functional role) yield arbitrary boundaries depending on choice of operationalization. Without well-founded stop-criteria, extended cognition licenses arbitrary individuation. This applies directly to offloading research: studies may arbitrarily decide what counts as "part of" the cognitive system versus external support without explicit, justified criteria for extending cognitive system boundaries in specific empirical contexts.

Hutchins (2010) proposes cognitive ecology as an alternative that sidesteps individuation problems by studying how cognitive ecosystems are assembled rather than where cognitive boundaries lie. Cognitive processes are distributed across brain, body, and environment through cultural practices and material structures. Rather than asking where cognition is located, cognitive ecology examines how cognitive ecosystems emerge from interactions across multiple components and timescales, from evolutionary to interactional. This framework offers a different lens for interpreting offloading phenomena as ecosystem-level processes rather than boundary disputes.

The methodological concerns connect to normative questions about cognitive autonomy. Padalko (2025) argues that IoT environments reduce cognitive autonomy through algorithmic mediation and platform dependency. Even if cognitive extension is philosophically coherent, widespread offloading to digital and AI systems may raise distinct normative questions about autonomy and cognitive self-determination. Andrada, Clowes, and Smart (2022) examine how AI system opacity affects cognitive agency when such systems are integrated into human cognitive practices. They distinguish different transparency dimensions (functional, procedural, epistemic) and argue that different forms of transparency matter for different aspects of cognitive agency. When AI systems function as cognitive resources through offloading, transparency requirements differ from when humans merely use AI outputs. Whether opaque AI systems can genuinely extend cognition or whether transparency is necessary for cognitive integration remains contested.

Chiriatti et al. (2025) propose a "System 0" framework for AI as cognitive extension while identifying a paradox: AI may simultaneously expand and constrain thinking. The normative dimension suggests that even if philosophical arguments favor some form of cognitive extension, the practical significance of the debate involves questions about what kinds of cognitive dependencies are desirable. Firth et al. (2019) review evidence that Internet use alters attention, memory, and social cognition, potentially reflecting neuroplastic changes. Whether such alterations constitute genuine cognitive changes or adaptive strategy shifts—and whether they represent cognitive enhancement or impairment—cannot be settled by metaphysical arguments about extension alone.

These methodological and normative concerns suggest limits on what extended cognition claims can establish. The difficulty of operationalizing extended systems empirically, combined with normative concerns about cognitive dependence, means that the practical significance of the debate remains contested. Even if cognitive extension is possible in principle, determining when it occurs in practice and whether it is desirable requires criteria that philosophical debates have not yet provided.
