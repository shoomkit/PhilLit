====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The extended mind thesis (EMT), introduced by Clark and Chalmers in 1998, challenges traditional cognitive science by arguing that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain to include aspects of the physical and social environment. The thesis distinguishes itself from standard externalism about mental content by proposing active externalism - the view that external resources can play constitutive (not merely causal) roles in cognition when they are coupled with internal processes in the right way. The debate centers on the parity principle, which holds that if external processes perform the same functional role as internal processes, they should count as genuinely cognitive.

The literature divides into proponents who develop and defend various versions of EMT (Clark, Rowlands, Menary, Wilson) and critics who challenge the coupling-constitution inference and argue for principled boundaries to cognition (Adams and Aizawa, Rupert). Key theoretical issues include the distinction between vehicle and content externalism, the role of functionalist and externalist commitments, the proper individuation of cognitive systems, and whether EMT represents a genuine alternative to computational-representational theories or merely extends their scope.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the essential theoretical foundation for understanding how cognitive processes might extend into external resources. The debates about parity, coupling, and constitution directly inform questions about when external tools genuinely become part of cognitive processes versus merely supporting them. The functionalist framework underlying EMT connects to questions about what makes cognitive offloading genuinely cognitive rather than merely instrumental.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited coverage of the distinction between different motivations for EMT (phenomenological vs functional). Few papers addressing the relationship between EMT and empirical research on cognitive offloading. The role of learning and skill acquisition in establishing cognitive extension remains underexplored in this foundational literature. Six entries lack abstracts (Rupert 2004, Wilson 2005, Farkas 2011, Theiner 2011, Farina & Levin 2021, Farina & Lavazza 2022) - marked INCOMPLETE and excluded from synthesis but retained for reference completeness.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around the core theoretical commitments (parity principle, active externalism, functionalism), then map major positions (strong EMT, modest EMT, critics). Distinguish conceptual arguments from empirical considerations. Track how different authors understand the coupling-constitution inference and what constraints they place on cognitive extension.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong EMT (Clark, Rowlands): 8 papers - Cognitive processes routinely extend beyond the skull under ordinary conditions
- Modest EMT (Wilson, Menary): 3 papers - Some cognitive processes can extend in special circumstances
- Critics (Adams/Aizawa, Rupert, Farkas): 4 papers - Principled arguments against cognitive extension
- Meta-theoretical (Wheeler): 1 paper - Framework for understanding embodied-embedded cognition

DOMAIN: Parity Principle and Critiques
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP (Embodied Cognition), Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The parity principle, introduced by Clark and Chalmers (1998), holds that if an external process plays the same functional role as an internal one, it should count as cognitive. This domain encompasses the principle's formulation, major philosophical critiques, and proposed alternatives. The central debate revolves around whether functional parity is sufficient for cognitive status or whether additional criteria are needed.

Critics like Adams and Aizawa (2001) argue that parity leads to "cognitive bloat" and that genuine cognition requires non-derived content. Rupert (2004, 2009) challenges the principle via his Hypothesis of Embedded Cognition (HEC), proposing that cognitive systems are individuated by causal integration rather than parity. Sprevak (2009) and Wheeler (2010) explore whether functionalism entails extended mind, while Wheeler (2011) seeks conceptual clarification of what parity actually requires.

Recent work proposes alternatives to parity: Candiotto (2022) advances the "not possible without" principle emphasizing existential necessity; Goldstone (2019) introduces a "Reversed Parity Principle" for internal tool-building; Oliveira (2025) adds "maintainability" to trust-and-glue criteria. Smithies (2018) argues that epistemological accessibilism is incompatible with vehicle externalism, challenging parity from an epistemic angle.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the methodological foundations of extended mind theory. Understanding parity critiques illuminates why cognitive offloading cases may or may not constitute genuine cognitive extension. The debate over cognitive criteria shapes how we conceptualize the boundaries between cognitive processes and mere coupling.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers systematically compare parity with alternative principles across multiple case studies. Limited empirical testing of whether parity matches folk intuitions about cognition (though see experimental philosophy work by Y\u00fcksel 2025). Underdeveloped connection between parity debates and recent work on cognitive integration (Heersmink, Kirchhoff).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Structure synthesis around three positions: (1) pro-parity defenses (Wheeler, Clark), (2) anti-parity critiques demanding additional cognitive criteria (Adams & Aizawa, Rupert, Sprevak), (3) alternative principles that transcend or replace parity (Candiotto, Goldstone). Highlight how the debate shifted from whether parity is correct to what cognitive criteria should replace or supplement it.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Pro-Parity Functionalists: 2 papers - Defend functional parity as sufficient or necessary for cognitive status
- Anti-Parity Internalists: 6 papers - Argue parity is insufficient; demand mark of the cognitive, natural kinds, or other criteria
- Alternative Principles: 3 papers - Propose replacements for or supplements to parity
- Epistemological Critiques: 1 paper - Challenge parity on grounds of epistemic access
- Recent Applications: 4 papers - Apply parity debates to AI, privacy, consciousness

DOMAIN: Coupling-Constitution Debate
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The coupling-constitution debate represents a central challenge to the extended mind thesis. Critics, particularly Adams and Aizawa, argue that proponents of extended cognition commit a "coupling-constitution fallacy" by conflating causal coupling with cognitive constitution. They contend that merely because external resources are causally coupled to cognitive processes does not mean those resources constitute part of cognition itself. Adams and Aizawa propose a "mark of the cognitive" based on intrinsic content and non-derived representation as criteria for genuine cognition, arguing for "contingent intracranialism" rather than extended cognition.

Defenders of extended cognition have responded through multiple strategies. Menary develops the "cognitive integration" framework, arguing that coupled systems can form integrated wholes where the distinction between coupling and constitution dissolves. Wheeler and Sprevak defend "extended functionalism," arguing that functional role, not intrinsic properties, determines cognitive status. Kirchhoff and others propose that constitution should be understood dynamically and diachronically rather than synchronically. Recent work explores whether mutual manipulability, complementarity, and deep functional integration provide better criteria than the coupling-constitution distinction.

The debate fundamentally concerns how to individuate cognitive systems and whether location matters for cognitive status. It connects directly to broader questions about the vehicle-content distinction, the nature of mental representation, and the proper methodology for cognitive science.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
The coupling-constitution debate is crucial for evaluating the extended mind thesis at a foundational level. It addresses the core conceptual and metaphysical issues that determine whether cognitive offloading genuinely extends cognition or merely provides external causal support. Understanding this debate is essential for assessing whether empirical research on cognitive offloading studies extended cognitive systems or brain-external tool use.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the debate has generated substantial philosophical discussion, there is limited work connecting the coupling-constitution distinction to empirical criteria that could distinguish cases. Recent work on mutual manipulability and mechanistic integration offers promising directions but remains underdeveloped. Five entries lack abstracts (menary2013cognitive, sprevak2009extended, theiner2010recognizing, huneman2013causal, menary2007cognitive) and are marked INCOMPLETE; these remain in the bibliography for completeness but are excluded from synthesis.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should trace the evolution of the debate from Adams and Aizawa's initial critique through various defensive strategies. It should clarify how different conceptions of constitution (synchronic vs. diachronic, intrinsic vs. functional) lead to different conclusions about extended cognition. The relationship between this philosophical debate and empirical research on cognitive offloading should be explicitly addressed.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Contingent Intracranialism (Adams, Aizawa): 6 papers - Extended cognition is logically possible but not actual; intrinsic content marks the cognitive
- Cognitive Integration (Menary): 4 papers - Integration dissolves the coupling-constitution distinction
- Extended Functionalism (Wheeler, Sprevak): 3 papers - Functional role, not location or intrinsic properties, determines cognitive status
- Mechanistic Constitution (Kirchhoff, Theiner): 3 papers - Mutual manipulability and mechanistic criteria ground constitution
- Critical/Neutral (Greif, Kagan): 2 papers - Examining the debate's assumptions or finding middle ground

DOMAIN: Cognitive Integration Approaches

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain explores integration-based accounts of the extended mind that
emphasize complementarity, transformation, and scaffolding rather than
simple parity between internal and external resources. The central insight
is that cognitive extension works not through functional equivalence but
through productive differences that transform cognitive processes. Menary's
cognitive integration framework rejects the parity principle in favor of
viewing external resources as creating hybrid cognitive systems through
integration. Sterelny's scaffolded mind approach distinguishes between
resources that merely support cognition versus those that constitutively
extend it through developmental and evolutionary scaffolding. The
complementarity principle, first articulated in physics but now applied to
cognition, captures how internal and external resources make distinct but
mutually necessary contributions to extended cognitive systems.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
Integration approaches provide philosophical frameworks for understanding
how cognitive offloading transforms rather than replicates internal
processes. They explain why external resources enhance cognition precisely
because they operate differently from biological memory and reasoning, thus
enabling cognitive transformations impossible with internal resources alone.
This directly addresses questions about what makes offloading genuinely
cognitive versus merely instrumental.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While integration theories excel at philosophical analysis, empirical work
connecting integration principles to measurable cognitive outcomes remains
limited. The relationship between scaffolding and enculturation needs
further development, particularly regarding how cultural practices shape
cognitive integration. Recent AI integration work (2024-2025) shows
emerging interest but lacks deep engagement with earlier integration
frameworks. Eight key papers (Menary 2013, 2009; Sterelny 2010; Palermos
2013; Heersmink & Sutton 2018; Riva 2025; Cole 2012; Menary 2007 book)
lack abstracts in digital repositories, though substantive notes capture
their core arguments.

DOMAIN: Empirical Cognitive Offloading Research

PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 7, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, arXiv, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Empirical research on cognitive offloading examines how humans strategically externalize cognitive processes to reduce internal cognitive demands. This research tradition emerged from distributed cognition frameworks but focuses on measurable behavioral outcomes and mechanisms. Key research strands include: (1) intention offloading, where individuals use external reminders (alarms, notes) to support prospective memory; (2) memory offloading more broadly, including the "Google effect" showing reliance on internet search for factual knowledge; (3) transactive memory systems where cognitive labor is distributed across social partners; (4) spatial offloading, particularly GPS dependence and its effects on hippocampal-dependent spatial memory; and (5) metacognitive control of offloading decisions. Recent work establishes that offloading decisions are guided by metacognitive monitoring (confidence judgments about internal memory), effort minimization, and individual differences in cognitive capacity. Neuroscientific studies have begun identifying neural correlates of metacognitive monitoring versus control in offloading contexts. A consistent finding across paradigms is that people often overuse external aids relative to optimal performance (a "cognitive offloading bias"), driven partly by underconfidence in internal memory and partly by effort avoidance.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the empirical grounding for philosophical debates about extended cognition and cognitive integration. The metacognitive mechanisms governing offloading decisions directly inform questions about when external resources become genuinely cognitive versus merely instrumental. The literature on costs and benefits of offloading (e.g., memory consolidation effects, skill atrophy with GPS use) bears on normative questions about cognitive autonomy and deskilling. Individual differences research challenges unified philosophical accounts by showing offloading is modulated by working memory capacity, age, and clinical conditions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited research on offloading in higher-order cognitive tasks (reasoning, moral judgment) compared to memory and navigation. Few studies directly compare offloading strategies across different external tools (paper notes vs. digital reminders). Neural mechanisms remain underspecified, particularly for how metacognitive signals translate into offloading actions. Four entries (Risko2015storing, Sachdeva2020excessive, Iley2024childrens, Cherkaoui2017strategic) are marked INCOMPLETE due to unavailable abstracts but are retained for reference manager import.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around offloading types (memory, intention, spatial) while emphasizing cross-cutting themes of metacognition and individual differences. Highlight empirical evidence for both adaptive and maladaptive offloading patterns. Connect findings on neural mechanisms (prefrontal-parietal networks) to philosophical accounts of cognitive boundaries.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Metacognitive control models: 8 papers - Offloading guided by confidence monitoring and effort calculations
- Cognitive costs perspective: 4 papers - Emphasis on negative consequences (memory decline, spatial skill loss)
- Individual differences framework: 4 papers - Offloading modulated by capacity, age, clinical factors
- Neural mechanisms: 2 papers - Brain substrates of monitoring vs. control in offloading

DOMAIN: Extended Cognition and Offloading - Theoretical Intersections
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-02-11

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP (not found), IEP (not found), PhilPapers (errors), Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the theoretical relationship between cognitive offloading research and extended mind debates. A central question is whether offloading phenomena provide evidence for or against extended cognition. Some scholars argue that offloading demonstrates functional integration between agents and tools, supporting constitutive extension claims. Others contend that offloading is better explained as embedded cognition - using external resources without cognitive constitution. Recent work by Britten-Neish (2025) connects offloading to action theory, arguing that Anscombean accounts of agency support extended mind interpretations. Hutchins' distributed cognition framework (2010) provides an alternative to both internalist and extended mind approaches, emphasizing cognitive ecology. The debate increasingly focuses on degrees of integration rather than binary distinctions, with second-wave extended mind theories proposing gradient accounts of cognitive extension.

Key theoretical tensions include: the parity principle versus complementarity hypothesis, whether offloading involves genuine cognitive processes or merely causal scaffolding, and how to interpret empirical findings about strategy selection in offloading tasks. Contemporary work explores whether cognitive integration admits of degrees (Heersmink), how offloading relates to enactivism (Sganzerla et al. 2025), and whether distributed cognition provides a better framework than extended mind for understanding offloading phenomena.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how philosophers interpret empirical offloading research and whether such findings support extended mind claims. It covers debates about cognitive boundaries, functional integration criteria, and alternative frameworks for understanding mind-world coupling. These theoretical disputes shape how offloading evidence is interpreted and whether it counts as evidence for cognitive extension.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited explicit discussion of specific offloading paradigms (intention offloading, metacognitive offloading) in philosophical analyses. Few papers directly compare predictions from extended mind versus embedded cognition frameworks. Missing systematic treatment of how different offloading strategies (metamemory-based versus perceptual-motor) relate to extension claims. Eight entries marked INCOMPLETE (no abstracts available): Michaelian & Sutton (2013), Facchin & Leonetti (2024), Hardy-Vallée & Payette (2008), Spitzer (2016), Deane et al. (2017), Dodig-Crnkovic (2018), Krueger (2018), Wijermans et al. (2008).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on how different theoretical frameworks interpret the same offloading phenomena differently. Emphasize methodological debates about what counts as evidence for cognitive constitution versus mere causal influence. Track the evolution from first-wave (parity-based) to second-wave (integration-based) extended mind arguments in relation to offloading.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Extended Mind Supporters (6 papers): Offloading demonstrates cognitive constitution when integration criteria are met
- Distributed Cognition Alternatives (4 papers): Cognitive ecology framework better explains offloading without constitution claims
- Enactivist Critiques (3 papers): Extension claims neglect active sense-making processes central to cognition
- Skeptical/Embedded (3 papers): Offloading shows causal scaffolding but not cognitive constitution
- Gradient/Integration Accounts (2 papers): Degrees of cognitive integration rather than binary boundaries

SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CORE, arXiv, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how smartphones, internet access, and other digital technologies function as extended cognitive systems. The central debates concern whether these technologies genuinely constitute cognitive extension or merely causal support for cognition, and what empirical evidence reveals about their cognitive impacts. Ward et al.'s (2017) "brain drain" hypothesis suggests that smartphone presence alone reduces available cognitive capacity, sparking considerable empirical investigation. Meanwhile, philosophical work by Smart, Clowes, and Heersmink explores how the Internet's unique properties—ubiquity, vast information scope, and dynamic updating—challenge traditional extended mind criteria. Recent research increasingly focuses on the "Google effect" (Sparrow et al., 2011) whereby internet access transforms memory practices, shifting from internal storage to knowing where to find information. The domain also encompasses debates about digital versus analog tools, the role of social media platforms in cognitive processes, and whether smartphone-mediated cognition differs fundamentally from other forms of cognitive offloading.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how contemporary digital technologies instantiate or challenge extended mind theory. The smartphone provides a paradigmatic case study for testing Clark and Chalmers' criteria, while empirical research on cognitive impacts illuminates the practical consequences of widespread cognitive offloading. The tension between enabling and impairing effects of digital tools is central to understanding both philosophical foundations and real-world manifestations of extended cognition.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the brain drain effect has received substantial empirical attention, less work examines how smartphone design features interact with individual differences to produce cognitive extension versus mere distraction. The philosophical literature on Internet-extended mind tends to focus on epistemological questions (extended knowledge) while relatively neglecting other cognitive domains like decision-making, emotional regulation, or creative thinking. Cross-cultural variation in digital tool use and its cognitive consequences remains under-explored.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this domain, highlight the interplay between philosophical theorizing about extended cognition and empirical investigations of digital technology impacts. The replication debates around the brain drain effect illustrate broader methodological challenges in studying technology-mediated cognition. Consider how the rapid evolution of digital technologies complicates both philosophical analysis and empirical study.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Brain Drain Effect (Ward): 6 papers - Smartphone presence impairs cognitive capacity
- Internet-Extended Mind (Smart/Clowes): 5 papers - Internet qualifies as cognitive extension
- Google Effect/Transactive Memory (Sparrow/Heersmink): 3 papers - Digital access transforms memory strategies

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers fundamental objections to extended cognition, alternative
theoretical frameworks, and methodological limitations of offloading research.
The critique landscape divides into three main strands. First, internalist
objections from Adams, Aizawa, and Rupert challenge the conceptual coherence
of extended cognition, arguing that coupling between brain and environment does
not constitute cognitive extension (the "coupling-constitution fallacy") and
that there exists a "mark of the cognitive" restricting cognition to intrinsic
neural properties. Second, alternative 4E frameworks—particularly radical
enactivism and predictive processing—offer competing accounts that either reject
representational content entirely (Hutto & Myin) or locate cognitive boundaries
differently (Hohwy's internalist predictive processing). Third, methodological
critiques examine problems with empirical extended mind research: unclear
individuation criteria for cognitive systems, arbitrary stopping conditions for
what counts as "part of" cognition, and difficulties translating philosophical
theses into testable predictions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These critiques reveal fault lines in both philosophical foundations and
empirical operationalizations of extended cognition and offloading. The
internalist challenges directly target the conceptual machinery undergirding
offloading research (if coupling ≠ constitution, what does "offloading"
mean?). Alternative frameworks suggest extended mind may obscure more
fundamental issues about embodiment, action-perception loops, or prediction
error minimization. Methodological concerns about individuating extended
systems directly impact how offloading studies design experiments and
interpret results.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited coverage of recent (2020-2025) empirical challenges to extended
cognition research. Predictive processing literature is extensive but its
implications for extended mind debates remain underdeveloped in this search.
Three entries marked INCOMPLETE (no abstract available): Sprevak 2009
(functionalist critique), Di Paolo 2008 (enactivist alternative), Rupert 2021
(predictive processing and systems). These papers remain in bibliography but
synthesis agents should rely on notes rather than abstracts.
SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Organize around three critique types (conceptual/internalist, alternative
frameworks, methodological). For each, distinguish what's at stake: whether
extended mind is false, whether it's uninteresting, or whether it's
empirically untestable. Track how defenders respond—e.g., Clark's replies
to Adams & Aizawa evolve from 2005 to 2010.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces active externalism and the parity principle, arguing that cognitive processes extend beyond the brain when external resources are coupled with internal processes in ways functionally equivalent to internal cognitive operations. Uses the Otto-Inga thought experiment to demonstrate how a notebook can constitute part of a belief system when it plays the same functional role as biological memory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and defends the extended mind thesis against major objections, introducing the notion of extended cognitive systems and arguing for complementarity between internal and external resources. Responds to Adams and Aizawa's coupling-constitution critique by refining the conditions for cognitive extension and emphasizing how brain, body, and world form integrated problem-solving wholes. Introduces the concept of cognitive niche construction and argues that human cognition is distinctively scaffolded by cultural and technological resources.

  RELEVANCE: This book-length treatment addresses the major theoretical challenges to EMT that emerged in the decade following the original paper. Clark's responses to critics and his development of complementarity and scaffolding concepts directly inform how we understand the mechanisms and conditions of cognitive extension in offloading scenarios. The emphasis on integration and coupling provides criteria for distinguishing genuine extension from mere tool use.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops systems-based and empirical objections to extended cognition. Argues that cognitive systems should be individuated by causal-explanatory boundaries, not functional equivalence, and that empirical evidence from cognitive science supports brain-bound cognition. Challenges the parity principle by showing that internal and external processes differ systematically in portability, reliability, and accessibility. Proposes that extended cognition conflates personal and subpersonal levels of explanation.

  RELEVANCE: Rupert's systems-based critique provides an alternative framework for individuating cognitive systems that competes with the functionalist approach underlying EMT. His emphasis on empirical evidence and explanatory adequacy connects theoretical debates to actual cognitive scientific practice. The portability and reliability arguments bear directly on when external resources can function as genuine cognitive components in offloading scenarios.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Distinguishes four forms of embodied cognition (embodied, embedded, enacted, extended) and argues that extended cognition represents a genuine alternative to Cartesian cognitive science. Develops amalgamated mind thesis: cognitive processes are hybrids of internal neural processes and external environmental structures. Emphasizes the role of action and manipulation in constituting cognitive processes, drawing on phenomenological insights about intentionality and world-directedness.

  RELEVANCE: Rowlands provides a systematic taxonomy of embodied-embedded approaches and situates extended mind within this broader framework. His amalgamated mind concept offers a middle path between strong externalism and internalism, relevant for understanding cognitive offloading as involving hybrid processes. The phenomenological dimension adds considerations about experience and intentionality to the functional arguments.

There is a new way of thinking about the mind that does not locate mental processes exclusively "in the head." Some think that this expanded conception of the mind will be the basis of a new science of the mind. In this book, leading philosopher Mark Rowlands investigates the conceptual foundations of this new science of the mind. The new way of thinking about the mind emphasizes the ways in which mental processes are embodied (made up partly of extraneural bodily structures and processes), embedded (designed to function in tandem with the environment), enacted (constituted in part by action), and extended (located in the environment). The new way of thinking about the mind, Rowlands writes, is actually an old way of thinking that has taken on new form. Rowlands describes a conception of mind that had its clearest expression in phenomenology—in the work of Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Merleau-Ponty. He builds on these views, clarifies and renders consistent the ideas of embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended mind, and develops a unified philosophical treatment of the novel conception of the mind that underlies the new science of the mind.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a Heideggerian approach to extended and embedded cognition, arguing that cognitive science must account for skilled coping and equipment-involving practices. Distinguishes different strengths of extended cognition thesis and argues that understanding-driven cognition (online intelligence) extends more readily than knowledge-driven cognition. Emphasizes the role of embodiment and environmental structure in enabling cognitive success without requiring explicit representation.

  RELEVANCE: Wheeler's framework provides conceptual tools for understanding different forms and degrees of cognitive extension, directly relevant to distinguishing when offloading involves genuine extension. His distinction between online and offline cognition suggests that not all cognitive processes extend equally, informing questions about which types of cognitive tasks are amenable to extension through external resources.

  abstract = {In Reconstructing the Cognitive World, Michael Wheeler argues that we should turn away from the generically Cartesian philosophical foundations of much contemporary cognitive science research and proposes instead a Heideggerian approach. Wheeler begins with an interpretation of Descartes. He defines Cartesian psychology as a conceptual framework of explanatory principles and shows how each of these principles is part of the deep assumptions of orthodox cognitive science (both classical and connectionist). Wheeler then turns to Heidegger's radically non-Cartesian account of everyday cognition, which, he argues, can be used to articulate the philosophical foundations of a genuinely non-Cartesian cognitive science. Finding that Heidegger's critique of Cartesian thinking falls short, even when supported by Hubert Dreyfus's influential critique of orthodox artificial intelligence, Wheeler suggests a new Heideggerian approach. He points to recent research in "embodied-embedded" cognitive science and proposes a Heideggerian framework to identify, amplify, and clarify the underlying philosophical foundations of this new work. He focuses much of his investigation on recent work in artificial intelligence-oriented robotics, discussing, among other topics, the nature and status of representational explanation, and whether (and to what extent) cognition is computation rather than a noncomputational phenomenon best described in the language of dynamical systems theory. Wheeler's argument draws on analytic philosophy, continental philosophy, and empirical work to "reconstruct" the philosophical foundations of cognitive science in a time of a fundamental shift away from a generically Cartesian approach. His analysis demonstrates that Heideggerian continental philosophy and naturalistic cognitive science need not be mutually exclusive and shows further that a Heideggerian framework can act as the "conceptual glue" for new work in cognitive science.

Develops the concept of socially extended minds where cognitive extension occurs through interpersonal interaction and social scaffolding.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys the extended mind debate and introduces cognitive integration as an alternative framework. Distinguishes extended mind from embedded mind and argues that the key issue is integration rather than mere coupling. Proposes that cognitive processes extend when internal and external resources are integrated through learned skilled activity. Emphasizes the role of enculturation and the development of cognitive practices in enabling extension.

  RELEVANCE: Menary's cognitive integration framework provides criteria for when coupling amounts to genuine cognitive extension, directly relevant to understanding when offloading creates extended cognitive systems.

Clark and Chalmers propose an “active externalism” that is to be differentiated from traditional externalism; it is concerned with the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes. The active nature of this externalism is explained in terms of the notion of causal coupling, which states that the human organism is reciprocally linked with an external entity. This link creates a coupled system that can be seen as a cognitive system in its own right.},

  RELEVANCE: This application of EMT to ethics raises questions about the normative significance of cognitive extension through offloading.

I argue that the extended mind thesis entails the falsity of the claim that interventions into the brain are especially problematic just because they are internal interventions, but that many objections to such interventions rely, at least in part, on this claim. Further, I argue that the thesis alters the focus of neuroethics, away from the question of whether we ought to allow interventions into the mind, and toward the question of which interventions we ought to allow and under what conditions. The extended mind thesis dramatically expands the scope of neuroethics: because interventions into the environment of agents can count as interventions into their minds, decisions concerning such interventions become questions for neuroethics.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Criticizes EMT for preserving an inside-outside dualism by treating mind as an inner core that extends into external artifacts. Proposes an artifactual mind concept drawing on Peirce: mind unfolds through artifacts rather than extending from a biological core. Argues that technical artifacts shape cognitive possibilities rather than merely serving pre-established cognitive goals. Mind is technologically constituted, not merely extended.

  RELEVANCE: This critique raises questions about whether EMT truly overcomes traditional boundaries or merely relocates them. The artifactual mind concept suggests that cognitive offloading may not be extension of inner processes but rather transformation of cognitive capacities through technological mediation. This alternative framework may better capture how tools reshape what cognition is rather than merely where it occurs.

According to the author, this is because a pivotal distinction between inside and outside is preserved in the Extended Mind theorist’s account of the relation between the human organism and the world of external objects and artifacts, a distinction which they proclaim to have overcome. Inspired by Charles S. Peirce’s philosophy of mind, in particular, the author tries to find a way out of this ‘inside–outside’ fallacy. External objects, artifacts or processes should, according to him, not be conceived as inanimate and unintelligent matter utilised by a separately living, inner mental sphere that has set certain pre-established goals for itself. Mind has rather an artifactual character. It is not extended by an inner biological cognitive core but rather unfolds itself through objects and artifacts. Mind as such is, especially in our modern technological culture, shaped by virtue of and through technical artifacts. Recognizing this artifactual dimension of mind will, the author concludes, enable a more critical analysis of contemporary claims that ascribe certain original and irreducible features to thinking.},

  RELEVANCE: Baker's concerns about personal identity connect to questions about whether cognitive offloading threatens the integrity of the cognitive subject.

  RELEVANCE: This application to psychiatry demonstrates how stakes of the extended mind debate connect to practical questions about cognitive functioning.

At the same time, the field of psychiatry has remained largely unacquainted with ExM, tending to rely instead upon what ExM proponents would consider to be outdated models of the mind. ExM and psychiatry, therefore, have much to offer one another, but the connection between the two has remained largely unexplored. Here, I consider what implications ExM may have for psychiatry and, in so doing, reveal how psychiatry may lend practical import to ExM. First, I detail the possibility of the extension of one mental state relevant to psychiatry. I augment this example by surveying other possibilities for extension in the context of psychiatric diagnoses. I then consider ways in which such extensions might alter psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Overall, I argue that recognition of the truth of ExM could alter the diagnostic status of certain individuals by correcting both false positives and false negatives, re-conceptualize certain aspects of treatment, help us re-envision psychiatric research, and potentially increase empathy towards those individuals considered to be mentally disordered or mentally different.},

  abstract = {The extended mind thesis (EMT) claims that the cognitive processes that make up the human mind can reach beyond the boundaries of individual to include as proper parts aspects of the individual’s physical and sociocultural environment. Proponents of the extended mind story thus hold that even quite familiar human mental states (such as states of believing that so-and-so) can be realized, in part, by structures and processes located outside the human head. Such claims go far beyond the important, but less challenging, assertion that human cognizing leans heavily on various forms of external scaffolding and support. Instead, they paint mind itself (or better, the physical machinery that realizes some of our cognitive processes and mental states) as, under humanly attainable conditions, extending beyond the bounds of skin and skull. Extended cognition in its most general form occurs when internal and external resources become fluently tuned and deeply integrated in such a way as to enable a cognitive agent to solve problems and accomplish their projects, goals, and interests. Consider, for instance, how technological resources such as pens, paper, and personal computers are now so deeply integrated into our everyday lives that we couldn’t accomplish many of our cognitive goals and purposes without them. The extended mind thesis claims that technological resources have become so thoroughly enmeshed with our internal cognitive machinery that they now count as part of the machinery of thought itself. Underlying (but distinct from) the extended mind thesis is a commonplace observation thatintelligent problem solving of the kind we find in adult humans isn’t something the naked brain can achieve all on its own, but is instead the outcome of the brain and body operating together in an environmental and often technologically loaded setting. As humans, we possess the kinds of high-level cognitive skills and abilities we do in no small part because of the many tools we use for thinking. The extended mind thesis goes further, however, by claiming that it is mere prejudice to suppose that all cognition must take place within the confines of the organism’s skin and skull. Cognitive science, it is then claimed, shouldn’t only concern itself with the more or less enduring processes taking place inside the heads of cognitive agents. Cognitive scientists should also investigate, on a kind of equal footing, temporary, soft-assembled wholes that mesh the problem-solving contributions of the brain and nervous system with the body and physical and sociocultural environment.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rupert's book-length treatment systematically develops the cognitive systems hypothesis (closely related to HEC) and argues that cognitive systems are individuated by persisting, dense causal coupling between components.

The book focuses specifically on the hypothesis of extended cognition, according to which human cognitive processes literally comprise elements beyond the boundary of the human organism. A systems-based approach is held to provide the only plausible criterion distinguishing what is cognitive from what is not. In most human cases, this system appears within the boundary of the human organism. It is argued that the systems-based view explains the existing successes of cognitive psychology and cognate fields in a way that extended conceptions of cognition do not and, furthermore, that once the systems-based view has been adopted, it is especially clear how extant arguments in support of the extended view go wrong. Additional aspects of the situated program, including the embedded and embodied views, are also examined. The book considers whether plausible incarnations of such views depart from orthodox, computational cognitive science, especially with regard to the role of representation and computation. It is argued that the embedded and embodied views do not constitute radical shifts in perspective. For instance, properly understood, the embodied view does not offer a new role for the nonneural body, different in principle from the one presupposed by orthodox cognitive science.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sprevak examines whether functionalism about mental states entails the extended mind thesis. He argues that standard functionalist commitments do not automatically support parity-based arguments for extension because functionalists can individuate realizers at different grain levels. The paper distinguishes between coarse-grained functionalism (which may support extension) and fine-grained functionalism (which resists it), showing that the relationship between functionalism and parity is more complex than often assumed.

  RELEVANCE: Sprevak's paper is crucial for understanding whether parity arguments succeed given functionalist background assumptions common in philosophy of mind. The grain-of-realization issue he raises challenges simplistic appeals to parity, showing that even functional equivalence underdetermines cognitive boundaries. Relevant for assessing whether cognitive offloading cases satisfy functionalist criteria for cognitive status.

  POSITION: Functionalism-parity skepticism. Argues functionalism does not entail extended mind; parity insufficient without grain specification.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wheeler defends "extended functionalism" against critics like Rupert and Adams & Aizawa. He argues that properly understood functionalism does support extended mind when external elements satisfy the right functional profile, including appropriate coupling and reliability conditions. Wheeler contends that critics misconstrue what parity requires—it does not demand perfect identity but rather functional equivalence at the appropriate level of abstraction. The paper develops criteria for when external elements genuinely realize cognitive functions.

  RELEVANCE: Wheeler provides the most sophisticated defense of the compatibility between functionalism and parity. His account of appropriate functional equivalence refines what parity demands, addressing grain-of-realization worries. Essential for understanding how parity-based arguments can respond to internalist critiques while maintaining functionalist commitments.

ExC claims that there are conditions under which thinking and thoughts are spatially distributed over the brain, body, and world in such a way that the external factors concerned are rightly accorded cognitive status. It is concerned mainly with the whereabouts of thinking and thoughts that is separate not only from the position adopted by orthodox cognitive science, but also from the position adopted by any embodied-embedded account of mind. Adams and Aizawa have repeatedly emphasized the insufficiency of thoughts being spatially distributed over brain, body, and world solely in the sense that applies when some instance of intelligent behavior is discovered to be causally dependent on the bodily exploitation of certain external props. The chapter concludes with a brief remark on extended functionalism and phenomenal consciousness.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Wheeler clarifies what the parity principle actually requires, distinguishing it from caricatured versions attacked by critics. He argues that parity is not a simple identity claim but a methodological principle: if an external process would count as cognitive were it internal, then location alone should not disqualify it. The paper specifies that parity operates at the level of functional contribution, not implementational detail, and that it serves as a burden-shifting argument rather than a sufficient condition for cognitive status.

  RELEVANCE: This short paper is essential for understanding what parity claims and what it does not claim. Wheeler's clarifications dissolve some criticisms based on misunderstanding, while highlighting legitimate remaining challenges. The methodological interpretation of parity as burden-shifting rather than sufficient condition shapes how we evaluate cognitive offloading cases—parity shifts the burden to opponents to explain why location matters.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rupert argues that cognitive science terms like "memory" pick out natural kinds defined by specific mechanistic profiles, not mere functional roles. Parity-based arguments mistakenly treat functional equivalence as sufficient for category membership, when in fact cognitive kinds are individuated by deeper structural and mechanistic properties. A notebook may play a memory-like functional role, but this does not make it part of the memory system any more than a Martian with alien mechanisms would have human-type memory.

  RELEVANCE: This paper develops a natural kinds critique of parity that goes beyond the earlier cognitive bloat objection. Rupert's mechanistic individuationism challenges whether functional parity at any grain level suffices for cognitive status. The argument has direct implications for cognitive offloading: even if external tools play functionally equivalent roles, they may not instantiate the cognitive kinds studied by cognitive science.

Standard functionalism is compatible with location-based constraints on cognitive realization.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Candiotto proposes the "not possible without principle" as an alternative to the parity principle for socially extended cognition. While parity emphasizes functional equivalence and multiple realizability, the "not possible without principle" stresses existential necessity: some cognitive achievements are not merely achievable via social interaction but would be impossible without it. This shifts focus from functional substitutability to unique affordances of social, embodied, affectively-charged interactions that cannot be replicated by solitary processes.

  RELEVANCE: Candiotto's alternative principle challenges parity's emphasis on functional equivalence by highlighting cases where extension involves qualitative novelty rather than mere replication. This matters for cognitive offloading: the not-possible-without criterion distinguishes genuinely transformative cognitive extensions from functionally equivalent but existentially substitutable tools. The paper points toward non-functionalist criteria for cognitive extension.

By charging the social parity principle with reductionism about the social dimension of socially extended processes, the paper offers a new argumentative strategy for the socially extended mind that stresses its existential significance. The “not possible without principle” shows that not only is something more achieved through socially located processes of knowledge building, but also that, and more importantly, what is achieved is something that would not have been possible without social interaction . The social parity principle states that the result of an activity achieved via social interaction should be assumed functionally equivalent to a solitary investigation and is characterized by multiple realisability. Contrary to the social parity principle, the “not possible without principle” holds that the result would not have been achieved without the social interaction between (at least) two agents with specific existential needs. The socially extended mind never happens in a void. This means that the "not possible without" principle should be located in real-life, affectively charged, embodied experiences of skilful interactions between agents. This fundamental conceptual change via reference to the “existential necessity” that regulates socially extended processes is necessary in order to effectively lead the socially extended mind to a truly embedded and embodied account.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Goldstone introduces the "Reversed Parity Principle" (RPP): if external tools can become integrated parts of extended cognitive systems, then internal mental structures can likewise function as tools that feel foreign or "other" within the mind. While the extended mind thesis shows how we expand cognitively outward, the RPP reveals how we build internal cognitive tools (mathematical notation in our heads, linguistic scaffolds) that have a tool-like character. This inverts the direction of parity, using external tool integration to illuminate internal cognitive architecture.

  RELEVANCE: The RPP provides a novel perspective on parity by reversing its direction. Rather than asking whether external tools can be cognitive, Goldstone asks what parity reasoning reveals about internal cognitive structures. This matters for cognitive offloading: it suggests that internal and external tools may be more symmetrically related than traditional debates assume, challenging both internalist and externalist orthodoxies.

The Reversed Parity Principle (RRP) invites a perspectival shift that is potentially as illuminating as the extended mind shift.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smithies argues that epistemic accessibilism (the view that justification requires reflective access to one's reasons) is incompatible with vehicle externalism/extended mind. The parity argument assumes that functional equivalence suffices for cognitive status, but this ignores crucial epistemic differences: internal beliefs are introspectively accessible in ways that external information sources are not. Smithies contends that this epistemic asymmetry defeats parity arguments, as it shows that location does make a justificatory difference.

  RELEVANCE: Smithies provides an epistemological rather than metaphysical critique of parity. The access-based argument challenges whether functionally equivalent internal and external states provide the same epistemic support for belief. This matters for cognitive offloading: even if external tools play equivalent functional roles, they may not provide equivalent epistemic access, undermining parity from an internalist epistemological perspective.

On the other hand, there is a compelling argument for accessibilism: the Moorean argument from Smithies (2012). If accessibilism is incompatible with vehicle externalism, then both arguments cannot be sound.

PP theorists appeal to functional parity between internal prediction and external scaffolding, but the Markov blanket formalism used in PP defines cognitive systems by statistical boundaries that typically align with biological organisms. Facchin argues that PP's dual commitments create tension: parity reasoning pulls toward extension, while Markov blanket individuation pulls toward organism-bound cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Oliveira proposes adding "maintainability" as a fourth criterion to Clark and Chalmers' trust-glue-accessibility conditions for cognitive extension in AI contexts. While parity focuses on functional equivalence, maintainability addresses whether users can control and modify the AI systems they cognitively integrate with. This criterion responds to AI's capacity to learn user psychology and potentially manipulate cognitive processes, creating a power asymmetry not addressed by traditional parity reasoning.

  RELEVANCE: This recent paper extends parity debates to AI-human cognitive coupling, showing that functional equivalence is insufficient when external cognitive partners are adaptive and potentially manipulative. The maintainability criterion matters for cognitive offloading involving AI: even functionally equivalent AI tools may fail to constitute genuine cognitive extension if users cannot maintain control over the integration. Points toward power-sensitive supplements to parity.

First, we examine how ExM reshapes perspectives on human-AI interaction, particularly by challenging the Standard model of AI. We argue that AI, as an active non-organic agent, significantly influences cognitive processes beyond initial expectations. Secondly, we propose the maintainability as a fourth criterion in the Trust and Glue criteria of ExM, in addition to trustworthiness, reliability and accessibility. This addition aims to evaluate parity in coupled systems comprehensively addressing concerns about control in human-AI interactions. We highlight the risks posed by AI’s understanding of human psychology, which may lead to unintended shifts in our objectives and choices. Our analysis concludes that maintainability serves as a critical safeguard against the evolving challenges of human-AI integration.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Greif develops an aetiological functionalist approach to extended mind that adds evolutionary and developmental history to parity-based functional equivalence. He argues that extended cognitive traits should be grounded in evolved biological functions shaped by organism-environment coevolution. This historical dimension supplements synchronic parity by requiring that cognitive extensions emerge from long-term adaptive coupling between organisms and environmental features, not merely transient functional equivalence.

By adding historical depth to parity, Greif provides criteria for when functional equivalence reflects genuine cognitive integration versus temporary scaffolding.

Under additional reference to conceptual parallels between the Extended Mind Hypothesis and a set of heterodox theories in biology—environmental constructivism, niche construction, developmental systems theory—an argument for the grounding of environmentally extended cognitive traits in evolved biological functions is developed. In a spirit that seeks to integrate extended functionalism with views from cognitive integration and complementarity, it is argued (ad 1) that instances of environmental coupling should be understood as being constitutive to cognitive functions in either of two distinct ways. It is further argued (ad 2) that the historically and systematically prior environmental counterparts in that coupling are features of the natural environment.

The introduction, written by Don Ross, has the title "Science Catches the Will", and this title provides a good clue to the focal point of the collection and also to the conception of the terrain we find in many of the essays; there is something here we ought to catch, and we ought to catch it by a scientific approach. Putting things like this, we immediately invite a number of further questions, among them questions about what the will is supposed to be, what central philosophers have thought that it is, what science is, and whether science thus understood carries the right approach to the major aspects of the questions raised. That in its turn brings up general questions about the relationship between science and philosophy. While there is no doubt that good philosophy is in deep need of being informed by and fully responsive to developments in science, there is a similar requirement that scientists approaching philosophical issues be responsive to the state of the art and to the nature of the philosophical problems. There are no sharp lines between science and philosophy; the important thing is always to know what you are doing and to do it well.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

There are fourteen good essays here, and the collection is an outgrowth of interaction over some time. The authors are mainly philosophers, all of them with wide interests in neighboring disciplines, many of them with research contributions of great significance in a much wider field than what is called philosophy. Some of the contributors are not professional philosophers; their work is nevertheless philosophical in nature and/or of great relevance to philosophical theorizing.

Looking back at the last fifty years of philosophy of mind and action, we see Davidson and Anscombe as very important contributors to work on and about the will at the beginning of this period. We see them engaging with questions about the will as it was conceived of by earlier philosophers, and we see both agreements and disagreement between them. The present collection starts from Davidson, and many contributors see him as someone who attempted to make room for naturalism by seeing reasons as causes, and, as one contributor, Miriam Thalos, puts it, "He sought to do justice to the idea of agency as ownership over behavior, while nonetheless preserving a basis for some semblance of a science of action" (p. 125 in her essay "The Sources of Behavior"). This idea of ownership is developed like this: "What is mine about a piece of behavior, among the scientifically minded nowadays, is the pro attitude that I direct towards it, in the form of a mental state" (p. 126).

Thalos, in her essay, builds her own position partly by contrasting her views with Davidson's. In particular, she argues against Davidson by trying to undermine what she calls his motivationalism. She presents a simple principle she sees as closely connected with Davidson's principles, and provides a counterexample to it. Her principle states that if you intend to do something, you are able to do it; if no new considerations arise, and you are not prevented from doing it, then you do it.

Of course there are counterexamples to this simple principle, and she provides one where you get lost in thought while driving away to do shopping, and arrive at your workplace instead of at the store. She foresees a Davidsonian response; that arriving at your workplace was not an intentional action. Davidson, when accounting for agency, was aiming for an account of doing something intentionally. Davidson only wants to be committed to the view that you in fact go for the act you want most if you intentionally carry out one of the acts you consider. Therefore, this counterexample to Thalos's principle might not undermine Davidson's position; he might have no reason to think her principle is true or something that is entailed by his views. Thalos holds such a reply to be "unworthy and implausible" (p. 130), since arriving at the workplace was an action in the present example.

Here, it seems to me, Davidson has a further reply that is not an implausible one. Arriving at the workplace was an action also on his account: the result of many "smaller" things we did intentionally while driving. There are on Davidson's picture many things we do in virtue of doing something else. Sometimes we do indeed intend to do A, get lost in thought, do many things intentionally, but fail to do A, and do B instead. Then doing B is an action, but not necessarily something we do intentionally; it might be an unintended result of doing many other things intentionally. It seems to me that this reply works for this case, and that Davidson avoids this particular criticism from Thalos.

There is, I think, a genuine issue about how good the Davidsonian approach is at providing understanding in cases of routine, cases where we act on "auto-pilot", but that is a different matter from the question of whether his account of agency and of doing something intentionally faces a real problem from this particular type of counterexample.

What seems to be happening throughout Thalos's extremely rich essay is that she is pursuing a theory of agency that is different in scope from that considered by Davidson, Anscombe, and others. She also pursues very many dimensions of agency, and is instructively inspired by Michael Bratman. If, however, agency is not restricted to what we do intentionally, many of the problems look very different, and so do the connections between reasons and actions in the account of agency. To illustrate: Davidson gave up giving necessary and sufficient conditions for agency because of the possibility of deviant causal chains. Thalos does not really discuss deviance, and maybe this indicates that the focus has shifted. Maybe her notion of agency does not face this problem at all, with the consequence that the climber who lets the rope go, startled by the thought that this is a possibility, acts in her sense of acting (or exhibiting agency) without intentionally letting the rope go.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that both of Adams and Aizawa's main criticisms fail against extended cognition. Their proposed mark of the cognitive (intrinsic non-derived content) does not successfully secure contingent intracranialism, as it either excludes paradigmatic cognitive processes or fails to exclude external resources. The coupling-constitution fallacy charge misses the point: extended cognition explicitly claims that coupling relations can ground constitution when certain conditions are met.

  RELEVANCE: Represents a sustained recent defense of extended cognition against the coupling-constitution critique. Shows that the debate hinges on what counts as an adequate criterion for cognition and whether location-based criteria are philosophically motivated or arbitrary. Connects the coupling-constitution debate to the mark of the cognitive problem.

  POSITION: Defense of extended mind against coupling-constitution fallacy charge. Argues the fallacy charge is itself mistaken.

  abstract = {Clark and Chalmers (1998) introduced the extended mind hypothesis, according to which some mental states can be realized by non-biological external resources. A lively debate has flourished around this hypothesis, connected with the issues of embodiment, embeddedness, situatedness and enaction (cf. Clark, 2008; Menary, 2010; Shapiro, 2011). Two of the main criticisms addressed to the functionalist version of the extended mind thesis have been the so-called “coupling-constitution fallacy” and the alleged lack of a mark of the cognitive (Adams and Aizawa, 2001, 2005, 2009, 2010a,b). According to Adams and Aizawa, extended cognition is a logical possibility, but is not instantiated in our world. Following this view, they defend a “contingent intracranialism,” based on a specific mark of the cognitive that they propose. In this paper I intend to show that neither criticism is effective against the extended cognition thesis. In particular: the mark of the cognitive proposed by Adams and Aizawa does not secure contingent intracranialism; the coupling-constitution fallacy criticizes extended cognition on precisely the point the theory was intended to defend: namely, that the best way to individuate cognitive systems, given a minimal mark of the cognitive, is to rely on coupling relations between agents and environmental resources.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "cognitive integration" as an alternative framework to the coupling-constitution debate. Integrated cognitive systems involve bidirectional information flow, mutual manipulation, and complementary contributions from neural and external elements. When properly integrated, external resources do not merely support cognition but constitute the cognitive system itself. The coupling-constitution distinction assumes a problematic atomism about cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: Offers a positive alternative to the defensive strategies against Adams and Aizawa. Rather than defending the inference from coupling to constitution, Menary reconceptualizes the relationship: proper integration just is constitution. This framework has been influential in subsequent extended cognition literature and connects to mechanistic approaches in philosophy of science.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Menary advances cognitive integration as an alternative to
  parity-based extended mind theories, arguing that cognitive extension
  occurs through the integration of neural, bodily, and environmental
  resources into hybrid systems via cognitive practices. Rather than
  external resources functionally equivalent to internal ones, integration
  involves complementarity where different resources make distinct
  contributions. Enculturation plays a key role, as cognitive practices are
  culturally transmitted and transform individual cognitive capacities
  through developmental scaffolding.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides the mature formulation of Menary's
  integration framework, directly addressing how cognitive offloading works
  through transformation rather than replication. The emphasis on cognitive
  practices offers a concrete mechanism for understanding how external
  resources become genuinely cognitive. The cultural dimension connects
  individual cognitive extension to social and historical processes,
  situating offloading within broader enculturated practices.

  Clark-Chalmers parity, emphasizing complementarity and transformation

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends extended cognition by reconceptualizing constitution in terms of mutual manipulability and mechanistic integration, drawing on Craver's mechanistic philosophy of neuroscience. External resources constitute parts of cognitive systems when they are mutually manipulable with internal processes and contribute non-redundantly to cognitive functions. This mechanistic criterion avoids both the coupling-constitution fallacy and the mark of the cognitive problem.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces mutual manipulability as a criterion for cognitive constitution, offering a middle path between Adams and Aizawa's intrinsic content criterion and purely functional approaches. This mechanistic framework has become increasingly influential and connects the extended cognition debate to debates about mechanistic explanation in cognitive science. Provides empirically grounded criteria for determining when external resources are constitutive.

  abstract = {Abstract This paper explores several paths by which the extended cognition (EC) thesis may overcome the coupling-constitution fallacy. In so doing, I address a couple of shortcomings in the contemporary literature. First, on the dimension of first-wave EC, I argue that constitutive arguments based on functional parity suffer from either a threat of cognitive bloat or an impasse with respect to determining the correct level of grain in the attribution of causal-functional roles. Second, on the dimension of second-wave EC, I argue that especially the complementarity approach suffers from a similar sort of dilemma as first-wave EC: an inability to justify just what entails the ontological claim of EC over the scaffolding claim of weaker approaches in cognitive science. In this paper I show that two much more promising explanations by which to ground the ontological claim of EC are available, both starting from an exploration of the coordination dynamics between environmental resources and neural resources. On the one hand, I argue that second-wave EC based on cognitive integration, with its focus on bodily manipulations constrained by cognitive norms, is capable of resolving the coupling-constitution fallacy. On the other hand, I argue that the framework of cognitive integration can be supplemented by philosophical accounts of mechanistic explanation, because such accounts enable us to explain the emergence of higher-level cognitive properties due to a system's organization-dependent structure.

Thanks to Richard Menary, John Sutton, and Will Newsome for helpful discussion. I am also grateful for the highly constructive comments made by two anonymous referees. Notes Notes [1] Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for proposing this response. [2] There is a slight disagreement in the mechanistic literature about the extent to which one can apply the mechanistic framework to cases of EC. In particular, Craver argues that “many cognitive mechanisms draw upon resources outside of the brain and outside of the body to such an extent that it is not fruitful to see the skin, or surface of the CNS, as a useful boundary” (2007, p. 141). However, Bechtel (2009 Bechtel, W. 2009. “Explanation: Mechanism, modularity, and situated cognition”. In The Cambridge handbook of situated cognition, Edited by: Robbins, P and Aydede, M. 155–170. New York: Cambridge University Press. [Google Scholar]) thinks that mechanistic explanations are more compatible with weaker embodied and situated approaches to cognition. Note that Bechtel does not think that this necessarily must be this way. As he mentions, what is critical for a mechanistic explanation is first to identify the phenomenon for which one is seeking an explanation (Bechtel, personal communication, January 11, 2011). If the system accomplishing the phenomenon functions as a result of causal interdependence between an individual and artifacts, then that is the place to locate the explanation. But, “my bet is that there will remain the task of explaining how the organism engages their environment, and that this phenomenon is to be explained inside the head and these will resemble the traditional explanations in cognitive psychology” (Bechtel, personal communication, January 11, 2011). This emerging picture between proponents of mechanistic explanation as to whether the framework can be applied to extended and distributed cognitive science is evidence of an important fact, namely that the ideas of EC are being discussed outside the mainstream debates over EC. Moreover, as I have already mentioned, Theiner (2009 Theiner, G. 2009. “Making sense of group cognition: The curious case of transactive memory systems”. In ASCS09: Proceedings of the 9th Conference of the Australasian Society for Cognitive Science, Edited by: Christensen, W, Schier, E and Sutton, J. 334–342.

  abstract = {Abstract The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) has been criticized as committing what is called the coupling–constitution fallacy, but it is the critic's use of this concept which is fallacious. It is true that there is no reason to deny that the line between the self and the world should be drawn at the skull and/or the skin. But the data used to support HEC reveal that there was never a good enough reason to draw the line there in the first place. The burden of proof has fallen on the mind–brain identity theory, now that our intuitions/prejudices no longer support it. One of those “intuitions” is the Aristotelian assumption that the world can be neatly divided into objects that possess intrinsic causal powers, and the causal relations that connect those objects. In modern science, however, the concept of intrinsic causal powers is only a temporary stopgap that makes it possible to begin research in a particular area. It therefore seems best to assume that the line between mind and world is both pragmatic and dynamic. Consequently, the mind might best described as a fluctuating field, rather than an object or structure. Keywords: Behavioral FieldCoupling–Constitution FallacyExtended CognitionFrederick AdamsRobert RupertAndy ClarkKenneth Aizawa Notes [1] This is one of the most common, and most easily answered, objections to HEC. Bickle implies that the mind–brain identity theory must be true because “We cannot—as a matter of empirical fact, not metaphysical intuition—intervene into any environmental components of a causal nexus to change the behavioral effect, without evoking changes in the nervous system” (2008, p. 510). However, this fact, and the other empirical facts that Bickle cites after this quote, only show that the brain is necessary for mental states, and identity requires both necessity and sufficiency. Spark plugs are necessary in order to have a functioning car, but the fact that they are not sufficient prevents one from driving to work with nothing but a set of spark plugs. He also points out that “we can invoke behavioral change by manipulating neural components in the causal nexus, without changing the normal environmental components one iota … experimental techniques exist for doing exactly this” (Bickle, Citation2008, pp. 510–511). This does not, however, prove that these neural components are identical to the experiences of the organism being manipulated. A fuse box can control the lighting system of an entire house, but that does not make the fuse box identical to the lighting system. Neurophilosophers often cite detailed facts to support a position, but the real challenge is often determining whether facts of that sort actually support their position. [2] Or more accurately, societies of cognizers understanding their world, although that idea is still new even for HEC theorists. We obviously do not live in a multisolipsistic universe in which each organism has its own self-contained world. The world in the mind's brain–body–world nexus contains not only other physical items, but also other minds. The symbiotic relationship that mutually constitutes minds and physical items is both different from and similar to the sympathetic relationship that mutually constitutes minds in a shared world. There is obviously a great deal that needs to be said about these similarities and differences. Heidegger acknowledged the differences when he made a distinction between (1) the present-at-hand and ready-to-hand being of physical objects and (2) the being-with that we share with other dasein (Heidegger, Citation1926/1962, pp. 153–163). However, as is his wont, Heidegger said very little about how to explain these differences in scientific terms. In Rockwell (Citation2007), there is some discussion of the possibility that people who have strong sympathetic attachments to each other (family, friends, etc.) could be said in some sense to feel the same emotion, rather than be aware of each other's different emotions. These kinds of sympathetic attachments would fluctuate if the mind is a behavioral field, which would create the illusion that these minds are intrinsically separate and distinct. Like the rest of the HEC, this is counterintuitive and weird, but there is no denying that there are serious problems with the current paradigm of isolated rational egos that has emerged from our Cartesian presuppositions. That, however, is a subject for another book, at the very least.},

Contingent intracranialists deny that extracranial resources can be components of genuine extended cognitive systems. They claim that transcranialists fallaciously conflate coupling with constitution and construe cognition as extending always from brains into world rather than world into brains. By using insights from recent research in developmental psychology and by explicating the nature of one form that deep functional integration can take, I argue that (i) transcranialists do not fallaciously conflate coupling wth constitution, and (ii) human emotional ontogenesis is a world-to-brain transcranial achievement.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sterelny distinguishes between extended and scaffolded
  minds, arguing that while environmental resources are crucial to human
  cognition, they typically scaffold rather than constitute cognitive
  processes. Scaffolding involves resources that support cognitive
  development and performance without becoming parts of the cognitive system
  itself. This occurs through evolutionary and developmental processes that
  structure learning environments, enabling skill acquisition without
  requiring cognitive extension. The distinction turns on whether resources
  are reliably available during cognitive processing versus being
  developmental aids.

  RELEVANCE: This paper presents a major alternative to extended mind
  theory, directly relevant to understanding whether cognitive offloading
  extends or merely supports cognition. The scaffolding framework offers a
  way to acknowledge the importance of external resources while maintaining
  internalist boundaries. The developmental and evolutionary dimensions
  provide timescale-sensitive analyses missing from parity-based approaches.

  POSITION: Defends scaffolded mind as an alternative to extension,
  emphasizing developmental and evolutionary support over constitution.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Palermos develops an epistemological framework for extended
  cognition based on cognitive integration rather than parity. He argues
  that extended cognitive systems can ground knowledge when external
  resources are integrated through reliable coupling that makes them
  cognitively transparent and trust-independent. This integration-based
  approach to extended knowledge avoids problems facing parity-based
  accounts while maintaining that genuine epistemic extension requires more
  than mere reliable access.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects cognitive integration to epistemology,
  addressing whether cognitive offloading can constitute knowledge or merely
  provide information access. The transparency and trust criteria offer
  concrete conditions for when offloaded information becomes part of
  cognitive character. This bears directly on questions about whether
  offloading to external memory genuinely extends knowledge or creates
  epistemic dependencies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schwengerer argues that online intellectual virtues are
  incompatible with first-wave (Clark-Chalmers) extended mind theory but
  compatible with second-wave theories emphasizing gradual cognitive
  integration. First-wave theories treat external resources as cognitive
  when functionally equivalent to internal states, but online virtues
  require critical engagement that presupposes awareness of
  internal/external differences. Second-wave integration theories can
  accommodate virtues because they recognize degrees of integration and
  maintain some internal/external distinction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper connects extended mind debates to virtue
  epistemology, addressing whether cognitive offloading to online resources
  can be virtuous or necessarily involves epistemic vice. The argument that
  integration-based accounts better support online virtues than parity-based
  accounts provides philosophical reasons for preferring integration

For instance, the world wide web seems to foster filter bubbles and echo chambers and includes search results that promote bias and spread misinformation. Richard Heersmink suggests online intellectual virtues to combat these epistemically detrimental effects . These are general epistemic virtues applied to the online environment based on our background knowledge of this online environment. I argue that these online intellectual virtues also demand a particular view of cognitive integration. Online intellectual virtues are incompatible with a popular conception of extended minds proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers . I suggest that if we want to hold on to both a conception of online intellectual virtues and some conception of the extended mind, we have to accept a more gradual theory of cognitive integration along the lines of second-wave theories of the extended mind .},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sganzerla, Hutto, and Kirchhoff develop extensive
  enactivism as an alternative to extended mind theory. They argue that
  cognition extends not through coupled systems satisfying parity or
  integration criteria, but through sensorimotor engagement that constitutes
  cognitive processes. Extensive enactivism rejects representationalism and
  functionalism underlying extended mind debates, instead grounding
  cognitive extension in embodied, environmentally embedded sensorimotor
  activity. This provides new arguments for extensive cognition that avoid
  problems facing both parity and integration approaches.

  RELEVANCE: This paper presents a radical enactivist alternative to both
  parity and integration frameworks, relevant to understanding cognitive
  offloading through sensorimotor rather than representational or functional
  frameworks. The critique of functionalist assumptions challenges whether
  offloading debates have properly understood the nature of cognitive

The extended mind thesis states that under certain (specialized and particular) conditions cognitive processes may be constituted by resources distributed across the brain, the body, and the environment. The extended mind thesis is part of a larger family of theoretical frameworks such as embodied cognition, distributed cognition, and various versions of enactivism (Gallagher in South J Philos 56: 421–447, 2018; Hutchins in Cognition in the wild, The MIT Press, 1995; Varela et al. in The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience, The MIT Press, 1991; Di Paolo in Topoi 28:9–21, 2009; Hutto and Myin in Radicalizing enactivism: basic minds without content, The MIT Press, 2013; Hutto and Myin in Evolving enactivism: basic minds meet content, The MIT Press, 2017).

As AI systems increasingly shape the informational substrate upon which human cognition operates, they transform from passive tools into active cognitive partners. Building on the Extended Mind hypothesis and Heersmink’s criteria for cognitive extension, we argue that AI systems satisfy key conditions for cognitive integration. These include reliability, trust, transparency, individualization, and the ability to enhance and transform human mental functions. However, AI integration creates a paradox: while expanding cognitive capabilities, it may simultaneously constrain thinking through sycophancy and bias amplification. To address these challenges, we propose seven evidence-based frameworks for effective human-AI cognitive integration: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding, which promotes progressive autonomy; Symbiotic Division of Cognitive Labor, strategically allocating tasks based on comparative strengths; Dialectical Cognitive Enhancement, countering AI sycophancy through productive epistemic tension; Agentic Transparency and Control, ensuring users understand and direct AI influence; Expertise Democratization, breaking down knowledge silos; Social-Emotional Augmentation, addressing affective dimensions of cognitive work; and Duration-Optimized Integration, managing the evolving human-AI relationship over time.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Riva addresses the "comfort-growth paradox" in AI

  offloading: external resources can enhance cognition but may simultaneously

In the paper I analyze the place of the epistemic subject within the extended cognitive system. Is it extended as well? In answering this question I focus on the differences between the first and the second wave of arguments for the extended mind thesis. I argue that the position of Cognitive Integration represented by Richard Menary is much more intuitive and fruitful in analyses of cognition and knowledge than the early argument formulated by Andy Clark and David Chalmers. Cognitive Integration is compatible with virtue epistemology of John Greco’s agent reliabilism. The epistemic subject is constituted by its cognitive character composed of an integrated set of cognitive abilities and processes. Some of these processes are extended, they are a manipulation of external informational structures and, as such, they constitute epistemic practices. Epistemic practices are normative; to conduct them correctly the epistemic subject needs to obey epistemic norms embedded in the cultural context. The epistemic subject is not extended because of the casual coupling with external informational artifacts which extend his mind from inside the head and into the world. Rather, cognitive practices constitute the subject’s mind, they transform his cognitive abilities, and this is what makes the mind and epistemic subject “extended”.},

Likewise, defenders of HEC have responded and even retreated into more moderate positions. In this paper, I trace the debate, rehearsing what I take to be the three strongest cases against HEC: nonderived content, causally natural kinds, and informational integration. I then argue that so far, the replies have been unsatisfactory, mainly because they rest on tacit assumptions about the nature of "human organisms," which are the very subjects in question. One such reply, Clark's (2008) recent hypothesis of organism-centered cognition (HOC), is shown to be a particularly hasty retreat, specifically in terms of tackling the issue of informational integration. Namely, my position is that Clark concedes too quickly that the organism is the "chief executor" of this cognitive function and I claim this on the grounds that (1) not all human organisms integrate information in the way Weiskopf (2008 Weiskopf, D. 2008.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Fritzman and Thornburg propose a "fourth wave" of extended
  mind theory drawing on Hegelian philosophy. They argue that previous waves
  (parity, complementarity, integration) inadequately address how cognitive
  extension transforms personal identity and subjectivity. The Hegelian
  framework shows how mind extends through recognition by others and
  participation in social-cultural institutions, constituting rather than
  merely supporting selfhood. This provides a more robust account of how
  cognitive extension relates to personal identity.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses philosophical questions about how
  cognitive offloading relates to personal identity and selfhood, extending
  integration debates into metaphysics of mind. The Hegelian social-cultural
  dimension connects cognitive extension to institutional and historical
  structures. This is relevant to understanding whether and how cognitive
  offloading affects who we are, not just what we can do.

  extension constitutes selfhood through social recognition.

The extended mind theory’s first wave invokes the parity principle, which maintains that processes that occur external to the organism’s skin should be considered mental if they are regarded as mental when they occur inside the organism. The second wave appeals to the complementarity principle, which claims that what is crucial is that these processes together constitute a cognitive system. The first two waves assume that cognitive systems have well-defined territories or boundaries, and that internal and external processes do not switch location. The third wave rejects these assumptions, holding instead that internal processes are not privileged, and internal and external processes can switch, and that processes can be distributed among individuals. The fourth wave would advocate socially distributed group cognition. Groups are deterritorialized collective agents; they are ineliminatively and irreducibly real, they have mental states. Individuals constitute groups, but groups also constitute individuals. What counts as an individual and a group is a function of the level of analysis. And they are conflicted.

Never, never: I’m on strike. Right now, I’m encrapulating myself as much as possible. Why? I want to be a poet, and I’m working to turn myself into a seer: you won’t understand at all, and it’s unlikely that I’ll be able to explain it to you. It has to do with making your way toward the unknown by a derangement of all the senses. The suffering is tremendous, but one must bear up against it, to be born a poet, and I know that’s what I am. It’s not at all my fault. It’s wrong to say I think: one should say I am thought. Forgive the pun. I is someone else. Tough luck to the wood that becomes a violin, and to hell with the unaware who quibble over what they’re completely missing anyway!i dversaries of the extended mind emphasize the importance of the “persisting individual” to cognitive science. They urge that this is incompatible with the extended mind’s transient couplings and hook-ups, linking individuals and aspects of their environments, thereby constituting cognitive systems. Yet, in the nineteenth century, Arthur Rimbaud recognized that individuals are constitutively conjoined to others, always already, who are themselves so conjoined, and that an individual’s persistence is that of a A “I Is Someone Else” | Fritzman & Thornburg 158 continuing process, not a substance. Metaphor: individuals are not trees, much less petrified wood, but rhizomes.ii Asparagus and ginger are rhizomes, Indian lotus too. With uncanny insight, Hindus not only portray Viṣṇu (the god of preservation) and Lakṣmī (the goddess of prosperity) on lotuses, they also depict the universe’s creation as a lotus emerging from Viṣṇu’s navel. Although not his main point, Rimbaud saw that a violin constitutively depends on its wood. And, his main point: I does not think; rather, I is thought’s result. In the “Preface” to the Elements of the Philosophy of Right, Hegel cautions his readers to not expect philosophy to give advice about what should be done.iii This is so, he explains, because philosophy’s comprehension is always retrospective, discerning an era’s essential characteristics only after they have already fully developed. So, it might be anticipated that a project of thinking with Hegel about the extended mind could at most discern what others have already achieved— articulating, clarifying, and making explicit—but that it would not advance the discussion. The extended mind would clarify Hegel’s concept of Geist (“spirit” or “mind”), and his concept of “right” (Recht roughly, social mores and law) serves as an exemplar of the extended mind.iv This could seem like a system of mirrors, mutually illuminating each other— and impatient readers might wonder when the smoke will be introduced. Nevertheless, the project of making things explicit can be valuable, articulating and then synthesizing, thereby making way for further conceptual advance. Moreover, Hegelians have defended the extended mind from Mark Sprevak’s argument that the extended mind is overly permissive in its attributions of mental states, and that—since functionalism entails the extended mind—both should be rejected.v Essays in Philosophy 17(2) 159 Naturally, Hegelians worry, not that the extended mind is too liberal in its attributions of mental states, but rather that it is too conservative. We will discuss the extended mind’s first two waves, suggesting that they really constitute one wave, explain that the third wave is well under way, and show that the resources are in place for a fourth wave. We suggest that the fourth wave is conflicted, constituted, as it were, by various interfering waves.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper introduces a novel paradigm where participants choose between using internal memory versus external information storage (dragging stimuli to visible locations) in a short-term memory task. Results show that participants strategically offload information based on metacognitive assessments of memory difficulty, with greater offloading when memory set sizes are larger. However, participants show systematic biases, sometimes overusing external storage even when internal memory would be more efficient.

  RELEVANCE: This is a foundational paper establishing the cognitive offloading paradigm for memory research. It directly demonstrates that offloading decisions are metacognitively guided, which is crucial for understanding whether external resources function as genuine cognitive extensions (requiring appropriate metacognitive integration) or merely compensatory tools. The finding of offloading biases raises questions about the optimality and rationality of extended cognitive systems.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review synthesizes research on intention offloading—the use of external reminders to support delayed intentions (prospective memory). The review establishes that offloading is highly effective for improving performance, systematically guided by metacognitive beliefs about memory ability, and shows stable individual differences over time. Crucially, offloading decisions are influenced by both accuracy of metacognitive monitoring and biases toward effort minimization, leading to systematic over-reliance on reminders.

  RELEVANCE: This review article provides an authoritative overview of the most developed strand of cognitive offloading research. It demonstrates that offloading involves sophisticated metacognitive control processes, not merely passive tool use, which supports accounts of extended cognition that emphasize integration mechanisms. The documented individual differences and developmental changes challenge unified philosophical theories and suggest offloading strategies are heterogeneous across populations.

  POSITION: Synthesizes the metacognitive model of intention offloading while documenting systematic biases and individual differences that complicate idealized models of optimal cognitive tool use.

  abstract = {How do we remember delayed intentions? Three decades of research into prospective memory have provided insight into the cognitive and neural mechanisms involved in this form of memory. However, we depend on more than just our brains to remember intentions. We also use external props and tools such as calendars and diaries, strategically placed objects, and technologies such as smartphone alerts. This is known as ‘intention offloading’. Despite the progress in our understanding of brain-based prospective memory, we know much less about the role of intention offloading in individuals’ ability to fulfil delayed intentions. Here, we review recent research into intention offloading, with a particular focus on how individuals decide between storing intentions in internal memory versus external reminders. We also review studies investigating how intention offloading changes across the lifespan and how it relates to underlying brain mechanisms. We conclude that intention offloading is highly effective, experimentally tractable, and guided by metacognitive processes. Individuals have systematic biases in their offloading strategies that are stable over time. Evidence also suggests that individual differences and developmental changes in offloading strategies are driven at least in part by metacognitive processes. Therefore, metacognitive interventions could play an important role in promoting individuals’ adaptive use of cognitive tools.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper demonstrates that individuals show systematic biases toward using external reminders even when financially incentivized to choose optimally between internal memory and reminders. The bias is predicted by metacognitive underconfidence—participants underestimate their memory abilities. Crucially, the bias can be eliminated through metacognitive advice (informing participants which strategy maximizes performance) and is mediated by shifts in confidence through feedback manipulation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides strong experimental evidence that offloading is guided by metacognitive evaluations rather than actual cognitive capacity. The finding that metacognitive interventions can shift offloading behavior is critical for normative debates about cognitive autonomy—it suggests people can be trained to use external resources more optimally. The persistent bias toward overuse challenges philosophical views that treat extended systems as inherently rational or well-calibrated.

  POSITION: Establishes that metacognitive error (underconfidence) drives systematic overuse of external cognitive aids, but demonstrates this bias is modifiable through metacognitive training.

  abstract = {Individuals frequently choose between accomplishing goals using unaided cognitive abilities or offloading cognitive demands onto external tools and resources. For example, in order to remember an upcoming appointment one might rely on unaided memory or create a reminder by setting a smartphone alert. Setting a reminder incurs both a cost (the time/effort to set it up) and a benefit (increased likelihood of remembering). Here we investigate whether individuals weigh such costs/benefits optimally or show systematic biases. In 3 experiments, participants performed a memory task where they could choose between (a) earning a maximum reward for each remembered item, using unaided memory; or (b) earning a lesser amount per item, using external reminders to increase the number remembered. Participants were significantly biased toward using external reminders, even when they had a financial incentive to choose optimally. Individual differences in this bias were stable over time, and predicted by participants' erroneous metacognitive underconfidence in their memory abilities. Bias was eliminated, however, when participants received metacognitive advice about which strategy was likely to maximize performance. Furthermore, we found that metacognitive interventions (manipulation of feedback valence and practice-trial difficulty) yielded shifts in participants' reminder bias that were mediated by shifts in confidence. However, the bias could not be fully attributed to metacognitive error. We conclude that individuals have stable biases toward using external versus internal cognitive resources, which result at least in part from inaccurate metacognitive evaluations. Finding interventions to mitigate these biases can improve individuals' adaptive use of cognitive tools. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).},

Experiments show that difficult questions automatically prime concepts related to computers/internet, and that saving information externally reduces subsequent recall. The authors argue the internet has become a primary transactive memory partner, fundamentally altering memory strategies.

The transactive memory framework links individual and extended cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis during an intention offloading task, this paper demonstrates that metacognitive monitoring (confidence judgments) and metacognitive control (reminder-setting decisions) have partially overlapping but distinguishable neural patterns. Both processes engage prefrontal and parietal regions, but they can be decoded separately and show limited cross-classification, suggesting distinct computational mechanisms despite shared neural architecture.

  RELEVANCE: This is one of the first studies to identify neural substrates of cognitive offloading and the metacognitive processes that guide it. The partial overlap between monitoring and control mechanisms has implications for philosophical debates about cognitive integration—if offloading control depends on dissociable neural mechanisms from confidence monitoring, this may indicate that using external tools involves additional cognitive operations beyond simple capacity assessments. The neural evidence grounds abstract philosophical discussions in concrete brain mechanisms.

  POSITION: Provides neuroscientific evidence for dual-process models of offloading where metacognitive monitoring and control involve related but distinct computational and neural mechanisms.

  abstract = {Metacognition describes the process of monitoring one's own mental states, often for the purpose of cognitive control. Previous research has investigated how metacognitive signals are generated (metacognitive monitoring), for example, when people (both female/male) judge their confidence in their decisions and memories. Research has also investigated how metacognitive signals are used to influence behavior (metacognitive control), for example, setting a reminder (i.e., cognitive offloading) for something you are not confident you will remember. However, the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control needs further study on a neural level. We used fMRI to investigate a delayed-intentions task with a reminder element, allowing human participants to use their metacognitive insight to engage metacognitive control. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that we could separately decode both monitoring and control, and, to a lesser extent, cross-classify between them. Therefore, brain patterns associated with monitoring and control are partially, but not fully, overlapping. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Models of metacognition commonly distinguish between monitoring (how metacognition is formed) and control (how metacognition is used for behavioral regulation). Research into these facets of metacognition has often happened in isolation. Here, we provide a study which directly investigates the mapping between metacognitive monitoring and metacognitive control at a neural level. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data from a novel task in which participants separately rated their confidence (metacognitive monitoring) and how much they would like to use a reminder (metacognitive control). We find support for the notion that the two aspects of metacognition overlap partially but not fully. We argue that future research should focus on how different metacognitive signals are selected for control.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper investigates why individuals often set reminders excessively, even for easy-to-remember intentions. Results show that excessive reminder use is driven by two factors: metacognitive underconfidence about memory abilities and effort minimization (cognitive laziness). Importantly, the study demonstrates that even when reminders require effort to set up, participants still overuse them, suggesting the bias toward offloading is robust.

  RELEVANCE: The finding of excessive offloading driven by effort minimization raises normative questions about cognitive autonomy and reliance on external aids. If people offload not because they need to but because it requires less cognitive effort, this challenges views that extended cognitive systems are adaptively optimized. The paper provides empirical evidence for concerns about technology-induced cognitive deskilling—people may offload because it's easier, not because it's necessary.

  POSITION: Argues that offloading decisions reflect a tradeoff between metacognitive accuracy and effort minimization, with effort avoidance sometimes dominating even when internal resources would be sufficient.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study extends laboratory findings on intention offloading to real-world contexts by surveying participants about their actual plans and reminder use. Results show that participants set reminders for plans they are less confident they will remember and judge to be more important. Crucially, lower confidence predicted greater reminder use, which in turn predicted higher fulfillment rates—demonstrating an adaptive metacognitive strategy where underconfidence leads to compensatory offloading and ultimately better real-world outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides critical ecological validity for laboratory findings on metacognitive control of offloading. The fact that lower confidence predicts greater success (via reminder use) in real-world contexts demonstrates that offloading can be an adaptive metacognitive strategy, not merely a bias or failure. This complicates normative philosophical debates—offloading may represent sophisticated self-regulation rather than cognitive decline. The real-world context is essential for evaluating extended cognition theories.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that metacognitive guidance of offloading operates adaptively in naturalistic settings, with underconfidence driving compensatory reminder use that improves real-world performance.

Recent work has explored the triggers of reminder setting, also known as intention offloading, finding that low confidence is associated with more offloading in laboratory tasks. This supports a metacognitive model of cognitive offloading. Here, we investigated whether this model generalizes to real-world intentions. We asked 112 participants about their upcoming plans and subsequent fulfillment of those plans in two online surveys conducted in 2022. Participants were more likely to set reminders for plans that (a) they were less confident they would remember and (b) they judged to be more important. Participants with lower confidence that they would remember to return for the second survey were more likely to set a reminder for this plan. This, in turn, predicted greater fulfillment. Therefore, ironically, lower confidence predicted greater success. These findings show that intention offloading predicts fulfillment of real-world intentions. They also point toward metacognition as a target for interventions to facilitate this. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This large-scale study (N=268) demonstrates that working memory capacity modulates offloading strategies and their effectiveness. Individuals with higher working memory capacity showed better performance when relying on internal memory, but this advantage was eliminated when reminders were available. Crucially, individuals with lower working memory capacity chose to offload more frequently and benefited more from offloading, suggesting adaptive calibration of offloading strategies to internal cognitive capacities.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides strong evidence that offloading is not a uniform phenomenon but varies systematically with individual cognitive capacities. The finding that lower-capacity individuals benefit more from offloading suggests external resources can genuinely compensate for internal limitations, supporting functional accounts of extended cognition. However, it also raises questions about whether offloading strategies are stable traits or context-dependent adaptations, relevant to debates about the constitutive versus instrumental role of external resources.

The current study examined whether the ability to offload intentions onto the environment mitigated these deficits. Participants (N = 268) completed three versions of a delayed intention task with and without the use of reminders, along with three measures of working memory capacity. Results showed that individuals with higher working memory fulfilled more intentions when having to rely on their own memory, but this difference was eliminated when offloading was permitted. Individuals with lower working memory chose to offload more often, suggesting that they were less willing to engage in effortful maintenance of internal representations when given the option. Working memory was not associated with metacognitive confidence or optimal offloading choices based on point value. These findings suggest offloading may help circumvent capacity limitations associated with maintaining and remembering delayed intentions.},

To address this, we conducted a study with 34 participants using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine how white matter connectivity supports metacognition-driven cognitive offloading. Behaviorally, we replicated prior findings showing that under-confidence in internal memory predicts a bias toward using external reminders. At the neural level, we used diffusion tensor imaging to quantify fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of microstructural integrity in white matter. We found the microstructural integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and cingulum bundle (CB) negatively predicted deviations from the optimal use of reminders. The microstructural integrity of the fornix negatively predicted participants’ confidence in performing the task when restricted to internal memory. Our findings reveal the microstructural organization of these fronto-temporal-parietal white-matter tracts are related to metacognition driven cognitive offloading.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study investigates time-based intention offloading (setting reminders for actions at specific times) while participants perform a concurrent working memory task. Offloading increased with longer delays and was reduced when a clock was continuously visible. Crucially, offloading was driven by metacognitive beliefs about the need for reminders rather than actual memory performance, and reminder use significantly improved accuracy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper extends offloading research to time-based prospective memory, showing that similar metacognitive principles apply across different offloading contexts. The finding that cue visibility (clock availability) modulates offloading suggests the decision involves weighing multiple environmental factors, not just internal capacity. This is relevant to philosophical debates about situatedness and the role of environmental structure in shaping cognitive strategies.

In everyday life, people often offload these demands to the external environment by setting alerts and reminders; however, this process of time-based intention offloading has rarely been examined experimentally. Here, we investigated this process in a paradigm where participants had to remember to press a key after a 10, 20, or 30 s delay, while simultaneously engaged in an ongoing two-back working memory task. Use of reminders improved accuracy, and participants were more likely to offload intentions at longer delays. This process was driven at least partially by metacognitive beliefs about the need for reminders, rather than the actual need. There was also an influence of time-monitoring demands: offloading was reduced when a clock was always visible, compared with a condition where participants had to press a button to reveal it. These results show that principles of cognitive offloading established in other domains also apply to time-based prospective memory: it improves performance, is influenced by cognitive demand, and guided by metacognitive beliefs.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study examines whether offloading behavior reflects a domain-general trait by comparing individual differences across two offloading paradigms (intention offloading and pattern copy tasks) and short-term memory capacity. Despite high test-retest reliability for offloading within each task, offloading behavior was uncorrelated between the two tasks. However, both offloading measures correlated with short-term memory capacity, suggesting task-specific offloading strategies that nonetheless respond to general cognitive limitations.

  RELEVANCE: This finding challenges unified theoretical accounts of cognitive offloading by showing that offloading is not a single stable trait but varies across task contexts. This has implications for philosophical theories of extended cognition—if offloading strategies are task-specific rather than domain-general, this suggests multiple distinct mechanisms rather than a unified "extended mind" process. The correlation with memory capacity supports compensatory models where offloading responds to internal limitations.

One strategy to compensate for information overload is cognitive offloading which refers to the externalization of cognitive processes such as reminder setting instead of memorizing. There appears to be remarkable variance in offloading behavior between participants which poses the question whether there is a common factor influencing offloading behavior across different tasks tackling short-term memory processes. To pursue this question, we studied individual differences in offloading behavior between two well-established offloading paradigms: the intention offloading task which tackles memory for intentions and the pattern copy task which tackles continuous short-term memory load. Our study also included an unrelated task measuring short-term memory capacity. Each participant completed all tasks twice on two consecutive days in order to obtain reliability scores. Despite high reliability scores, individual differences in offloading behavior were uncorrelated between the two offloading tasks. In both tasks, however, individual differences in offloading behavior were correlated with the individual differences in an unrelated short-term memory task. Our results therefore show that offloading behavior cannot simply be explained in terms of a single common factor driving offloading behavior across tasks.

Children watched as an experimenter first hid a target in one of three identical opaque containers. The containers were then shuffled out of view before children had to guess where the target was hidden. In the test phase, children could perform perfectly by simply placing a marker in a transparent jar attached to the target container prior to shuffling, and then later selecting the marked container. Children of all ages used this strategy above chance levels if they had seen it demonstrated to them, but only the 4- and 5-year-olds independently devised this external strategy to improve their future performance.

The link to metacognitive accuracy provides a mechanistic explanation for why offloading strategies change across development.

  RELEVANCE: This clinical study demonstrates that offloading strategies can be dissociated from objective memory ability—individuals with ASC show memory impairments but do not increase offloading accordingly. This challenges simple compensatory models of offloading and suggests that using external aids appropriately requires intact metacognitive awareness and strategic control. The findings are relevant to philosophical debates about cognitive disability and the role of external supports.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This large online study (N=600) examines how transdiagnostic compulsivity relates to offloading behavior. Compulsive individuals showed reduced preference for external reminders, partially but not fully explained by relative overconfidence in their memory abilities. Unlike previous studies, compulsive individuals still used metacognition to guide offloading decisions normally, suggesting the reduced offloading reflects a different mechanism than impaired metacognitive control.

  RELEVANCE: This study shows that clinical traits (compulsivity) systematically modulate offloading preferences in ways not fully explained by metacognition, suggesting additional motivational or affective factors influence offloading decisions. The reduced offloading in compulsive individuals implies they may be at risk for inadequate external memory support, which has implications for clinical interventions and normative questions about optimal offloading levels.

  POSITION: Demonstrates that transdiagnostic compulsivity reduces offloading preference beyond what metacognitive confidence alone would predict, suggesting multiple mechanisms influence offloading decisions.

CIT is associated with impaired metacognition, which in turn has been associated with cognitive offloading behaviours such as external reminder setting that play a key role in fulfilling cognitive goals. In an online study (N=600), we investigated individual differences in compulsivity, metacognition, and external reminder usage. Compulsive individuals had reduced preference for external reminders. This was partially, but not fully, attributable to their relative overconfidence. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for an impaired confidence-action link: compulsive individuals used their metacognition to guide offloading just as much as their non-compulsive counterparts. Given the compensatory nature of cognitive offloading, our findings imply that compulsive individuals are at increased risk of inadequate external memory support. Along with transdiagnostic variation in the general population, this finding could also have implications for clinical conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study manipulates the physical effort required to set reminders (easy vs. effortful button presses) across different memory loads. Results show that increased physical effort reduces reminder-setting at all memory loads, with the greatest effect at intermediate loads where participants are most uncertain about strategy choice. Participants with lower confidence in memory abilities set more reminders overall, but physical effort had similar effects across confidence levels.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates that the costs of offloading (here physical effort) directly influence strategic decisions about cognitive tool use, not just the benefits. This is relevant to philosophical debates about the seamlessness of extended cognition—if physical effort to access external resources significantly modulates usage, this suggests external tools are not transparently integrated but require explicit cost-benefit calculation. The finding informs normative debates about interface design and cognitive accessibility.

Recent studies have provided evidence for various cognitive and metacognitive factors that guide intention offloading, but little research has investigated the physical cost of reminder-setting itself. Here, we present two pre-registered experiments investigating how the cost of physical effort associated with reminder-setting influences strategic intention offloading under different levels of memory load. At all memory loads, reminder-setting was reduced when it was more effortful. The ability to set reminders allowed participants to compensate for the influence of memory load on accuracy in the low-effort condition; this effect was attenuated in the high-effort condition. In addition, there was evidence that participants with less confidence in their memory abilities were more likely to set reminders. Contrary to prediction, physical effort had the greatest effect on reminder-setting at intermediate memory loads. We speculate that the physical costs of reminder-setting might have the greatest impact when participants are uncertain about their strategy choice. These results demonstrate the importance of physical effort as one of the factors relevant to cost-benefit decision-making about cognitive offloading strategies.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study investigates whether offloading is guided by domain-general metacognitive confidence (measured in perceptual tasks) or task-specific confidence (in the memory task itself). Results show that domain-general perceptual confidence correlates with overall offloading frequency but not with bias toward optimal offloading. This suggests offloading is influenced by both stable metacognitive traits and task-specific metacognitive assessments.

  RELEVANCE: The finding that both domain-general and task-specific metacognitive signals influence offloading suggests multiple levels of metacognitive control. This has implications for philosophical accounts of metacognition in extended cognition—if offloading decisions draw on general metacognitive traits beyond task-specific monitoring, this suggests a more complex architecture than simple feedback-based control. It also informs debates about transfer of offloading strategies across contexts.

Research has found that metacognitive processes influence offloading such that individual differences in confidence predict individual differences in offloading regardless of objective cognitive ability. The current study investigated the cross-domain organization of this relationship. Participants performed two perceptual discrimination tasks where objective accuracy was equalized using a staircase procedure. In a memory task, two measures of intention offloading were collected, (1) the overall likelihood of setting reminders, and (2) the bias in reminder-setting compared to the optimal strategy. It was found that perceptual confidence was associated with the first measure but not the second. It is shown that this is because individual differences in perceptual confidence capture meaningful differences in objective ability despite the staircase procedure. These findings indicate that intention offloading is influenced by both domain-general and task-specific metacognitive signals. They also show that even when task performance is equalized via staircasing, individual differences in confidence cannot be considered a pure measure of metacognitive bias.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of extended cognition (HEC) casts human cognition as constitutively dependent on its bodily and environmental context. Drawing on recent empirical work on 'cognitive offloading', HEC's defenders claim that information processing offloaded onto such brain-external resources is sometimes 'genuinely' cognitive. But while debates about offloading have a high profile in philosophy of cognitive science, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the fact that paradigm cases of offloading are intentional actions. As a result, opposition to HEC is driven in part by unarticulated intuitions about the metaphysics of human agency. Thinking of action as a kind of interface between separately constituted intentions and bodily movements can make HEC look problematic. But while this view of agency has been popularised – most prominently by Donald Davidson – as analytic philosophy of action's 'standard story', it has come under pressure from philosophers influenced by Elizabeth Anscombe's very different account. According to this, actions express an agent's intention only in so far as they fit into the right kind teleologically structured worldly context. In this paper, I'll argue that HEC's supporters should adopt an Anscombean model of action. That is, they should understand cognitive offloading as a manifestation of human agency's general dependence on its bodily and environmental setting.},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that extended cognition's treatment of cognitive offloading requires an Anscombean rather than Davidsonian action theory, where actions express intentions only within teleologically structured worldly contexts. Opposition to extended mind stems partly from implicit Davidsonian assumptions that treat intentions and bodily movements as separately constituted with action as mere interface.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the project's question about theoretical foundations by showing how metaphysical assumptions about agency shape interpretations of offloading as evidence for extended cognition. Demonstrates that action-theoretic commitments underlie extended mind debates, suggesting offloading should be understood as manifesting agency's general environmental dependence rather than exceptional cognitive extension.

The cognitive roles played by such computational representations in discovery are not well understood. We present a theoretical analysis of the cognitive roles such representations play, based on an ethnographic study of the building of computational models in a systems biology laboratory. Specifically, we focus on a case of model-building by an engineer that led to a remarkable discovery in basic bioscience. Accounting for such discoveries requires a distributed cognition (DC) analysis, as DC focuses on the roles played by external representations in cognitive processes. However, DC analyses by and large have not examined scientific discovery, and they mostly focus on memory offloading, particularly how the use of existing external representations changes the nature of cognitive tasks. In contrast, we study discovery processes and argue that discoveries emerge from the processes of building the computational representation. The building process integrates manipulations in imagination and in the representation, creating a coupled cognitive system of model and modeler, where the model is incorporated into the modeler's imagination. This account extends DC significantly, and we present some of the theoretical and application implications of this extended account.},

  RELEVANCE: Distinguishes memory offloading from model-building as different forms of cognitive distribution, suggesting offloading research may capture only one dimension of external resource use. Shows how building activity creates tighter coupling than using pre-existing resources, bearing on questions about when external resources genuinely extend cognition versus merely support it.

Calls for greater transparency from such systems have been widespread. However, there is considerable ambiguity concerning what “transparency” actually means, and therefore, what greater transparency might entail. While, according to some debates, transparency requires seeing through the artefact or device, widespread calls for transparency imply seeing into different aspects of AI systems. These two notions are in apparent tension with each other, and they are present in two lively but largely disconnected debates. In this paper, we aim to further analyse what these calls for transparency entail, and in so doing, clarify the sorts of transparency that we should want from AI systems. We do so by offering a taxonomy that classifies different notions of transparency. After a careful exploration of the different varieties of transparency, we show how this taxonomy can help us to navigate various domains of human–technology interactions, and more usefully discuss the relationship between technological transparency and human agency. We conclude by arguing that all of these different notions of transparency should be taken into account when designing more ethically adequate AI systems.},

Specifically, we explore how unique features of the online world may be influencing: a) attentional capacities, as the constantly evolving stream of online information encourages our divided attention across multiple media sources, at the expense of sustained concentration; b) memory processes, as this vast and ubiquitous source of online information begins to shift the way we retrieve, store, and even value knowledge; and c) social cognition, as the ability for online social settings to resemble and evoke real‐world social processes creates a new interplay between the Internet and our social lives, including our self‐concepts and self‐esteem. Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly.

  abstract = {Multiple external representations (MERs) are central to the practice and learning of science, mathematics and engineering, as the phenomena and entities investigated and controlled in these domains are often not available for perception and action. MERs therefore play a twofold constitutive role in reasoning in these domains. Firstly, MERs stand in for the phenomena and entities that are imagined, and thus make possible scientific investigations. Secondly, related to the above, sensorimotor and imagination-based interactions with the MERs make possible focused cognitive operations involving these phenomena and entities, such as mental rotation and analogical transformations. These two constitutive roles suggest that acquiring expertise in science, mathematics and engineering requires developing the ability to transform and integrate the MERs in that field, in tandem with running operations in imagination on the phenomena and entities the MERs stand for. This core ability to integrate external and internal representations and operations on them – termed representational competence (RC) – is therefore critical to learning in science, mathematics and engineering. However, no general account of this core process is currently available. We argue that, given the above two constitutive roles played by MERs, a theoretical account of representational competence requires an explicit model of how the cognitive system interacts with external representations, and how imagination abilities develop through this process. At the applied level, this account is required to develop design guidelines for new media interventions for learning science and mathematics, particularly emerging ones that are based on embodied interactions. As a first step to developing such a theoretical account, we review the literature on learning with MERs, as well as acquiring RC, in chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and engineering, from two perspectives. First, we focus on the important theoretical accounts and related empirical studies, and examine what is common about them. Second, we summarise the major trends in each discipline, and then bring together these trends. The results show that most models and empirical studies of RC are framed within the classical information processing approach, and do not take a constitutive view of external representations. To develop an account compatible with the constitutive view of external representations, we outline an interaction-based theoretical account of RC, extending recent advances in distributed and embodied cognition.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes understanding cognition as morphological computation emerging from bodily structures processing information through self-organization. This info-computational approach integrates cognitivist and EEEE (embodied, embedded, enactive, extended) frameworks by treating cognition as complex multiscale phenomenon based on morphological information processing in evolved organisms.

  RELEVANCE: Offers computational framework for understanding cognitive distribution that bridges traditional and 4E approaches. Morphological computation perspective suggests offloading might redistribute computational work across different morphological substrates (neural, bodily, environmental) rather than extending cognition beyond brain per se.

  POSITION: Proposes morphological computation as integrative framework for understanding embodied and distributed cognition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ward and colleagues present the "brain drain hypothesis," arguing that smartphones consume attentional resources even when not in use. Across two experiments, participants performed worse on measures of available working memory capacity and fluid intelligence when smartphones were present (on desk) versus absent (in another room), even with phones turned off. The effect was strongest for high smartphone-dependent individuals, suggesting automatic attentional processes directed toward the phone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides empirical evidence that smartphone presence may undermine the very cognitive resources required for their use as extended cognitive tools. The findings challenge optimistic accounts of smartphones as seamless cognitive extensions by suggesting they impose cognitive costs through attentional capture. The research connects to broader questions about when external resources enhance versus impair cognition, and whether constant availability is compatible with genuine cognitive extension.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart, Heersmink, and Clowes develop a "cognitive ecology" framework for understanding how the Internet transforms cognitive practices and environments. They argue the Internet creates a unique cognitive niche characterized by information abundance, networked social interactions, and constantly evolving knowledge structures. The chapter examines how web technologies enable new forms of distributed cognition, collaborative knowledge production, and cognitive niche construction while also introducing novel forms of cognitive risk.

  RELEVANCE: This work provides comprehensive philosophical analysis of Internet-specific features relevant to extended cognition debates. Unlike generic information tools, the Internet's networked, dynamic, and socially embedded nature raises distinct questions about cognitive coupling, reliability, and the boundaries of cognitive systems. The ecological perspective helps frame how digital environments shape rather than merely support cognitive processes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart provides a comprehensive philosophical analysis of Internet-extended cognition, examining whether and how Internet technologies can constitute part of extended cognitive systems. He distinguishes between different types of Internet-based cognitive extension (e.g., memory extension via cloud storage vs. reasoning extension via search engines) and evaluates them against established criteria for cognitive extension. The paper introduces concerns about "network-extended cognitive bloat" where the boundaries of cognitive systems become unclear.

  RELEVANCE: This paper systematically applies extended mind theory to Internet technologies, identifying both promising cases and potential problems. Smart's analysis helps clarify which Internet-based practices might qualify as genuine cognitive extension versus mere tool use. His discussion of cognitive bloat and boundary problems directly addresses challenges the Internet poses for traditional extended mind criteria, particularly the coupling-constitution distinction.

In particular, the application of active externalist theorizing to the Internet gives rise to the notion of Internet-extended cognition: the idea that the Internet can (on occasion) form part of an integrated nexus of material elements that serves as the realization base for human mental states and processes. The current review attempts to survey a range of issues and controversies that arise in respect of the notion of Internet-extended cognition. These include the issue of whether the Internet, as a technological system, is able to support real-world cases of cognitive extension. It also includes issues concerning the cognitive and epistemic impacts of the Internet. Finally, the review highlights a range of issues and concerns that have not been the focus of previous philosophical attention. These include issues of ‘network-extended cognitive bloat’, ‘conjoined minds’, and an entirely new form of cognitive extension that goes under the heading of ‘human-extended machine cognition’. Together, these issues serve to highlight the value and importance of Internet-extended cognition to contemporary philosophical debates about the extended mind. In particular, the notion of Internet-extended cognition has the potential to highlight points of philosophical progress that are not easily revealed by the kind of technologically low-grade cases that tend to animate the majority of philosophical discussions in this area.},

Participants completed an automated operation span (OSpan) task, a Cue-Dependent Go/No-Go task, and the smartphone attachment and dependency inventory. It was hypothesized that performance on an attention-demanding task (i.e., the OSpan task) would be worse for those in closer proximity to their smartphone (on desk) and that those with greater smartphone attachment and dependency would have a larger "brain drain" effect. Using the same tasks and conditions as in Ward et al.'s (2017) second experiment, the present study found that the "brain drain" effect did not replicate: there was no difference between smartphone location conditions on performance on either the o-span task or the go/no-go task.

Given the current debate about the use of smartphones in classrooms and schools, it seems appropriate to examine their effects on aspects of cognitive performance in more detail. Ward and colleagues not only demonstrated the negative effect of smartphones on cognitive performance but also showed that the mere presence of these devices can have this effect—this is known as the Brain Drain effect. In the present article, a meta-analytic approach was adopted in order to verify these findings. Here we show a significant overall negative effect of smartphone use and presence. In a database search we identified 22 studies with a total of 43 relevant effects that could be assigned to the categories “memory”, “attention”, and “general cognitive performance”. A subgroup analysis suggests that not all cognitive domains are equally affected by the negative effect of smartphones. The heterogeneity of the effects reinforces this finding. The nationality of the test subjects or the origin of the studies was identified as a further key variable. Our findings also indicate that the distracting effect of smartphones varies on the area studies and further research is necessary. In view of the present research results, it seems important that people in general, and especially children and adolescents in schools and classrooms, learn how to deal with the distracting potential of smartphones.},

To assess the strength of evidence for the claim that the mere presence of a smartphone can negatively impact cognitive performance, this study reports a systematic review and six meta-analyses (k = 56, n = 7093). Across cognitive functions, only a single statistically significant pooled effect was found. Working memory capacity was negatively impacted by the mere presence of a smartphone, while results for the remaining cognitive functions produced null summary effects. The analysis also finds that there is substantial methodological heterogeneity and generally poor statistical power in the domain. Overall, while the current meta-analysis provides limited support for a negative albeit smaller than theorized brain drain effect due to the mere presence of a smartphone, given methodological concerns, the extent to which the current body of literature can support or refute the hypothesis is limited.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smart, Andrada, and Clowes argue that phenomenal transparency—the experiential quality of tools seeming to disappear during skilled use—is neither necessary nor sufficient for cognitive extension. They challenge proposals that transparency serves as a criterion for distinguishing genuine cognitive extension from mere tool use. Instead, transparency is a feature of situations supporting certain dispositional cognitive property ascriptions. The paper reframes transparency's role in extended mind debates.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis addresses a key criterion often invoked in evaluating whether smartphones and Internet qualify as extended cognitive systems. If transparency is required for extension, then attention-capturing digital tools would fail to qualify.

The present paper challenges this claim. It also challenges the idea that phenomenological properties can be used to settle disputes regarding the constitutional (versus merely causal) status of bio-external resources in episodes of extended cognizing. Rather than regard phenomenal transparency as a criterion for cognitive extension, we suggest that transparency is a feature of situations that support the ascription of certain cognitive/mental dispositional properties to both ourselves and others. By directing attention to the forces and factors that motivate disposition ascriptions, we arrive at a clearer picture of the role of transparency in arguments for extended cognition and the extended mind. As it turns out, transparency is neither necessary nor sufficient for cognitive extension, but this does not mean that it is entirely irrelevant to our understanding of the circumstances in which episodes of extended cognizing are apt to arise.},

It demonstrates that IoT is not merely a technological infrastructure but a mechanism that embeds cognition within algorithmic and service-based systems, reducing epistemic autonomy and deepening dependence on platforms and automated protocols. The study conceptualizes Homo connectus as a new socio-technical form of subjectivity shaped by platform dependency, technical mediation of action, algorithmic production of meaning, and systemic constraints on reflective decision-making. These transformations affect education, knowledge production, and professional competence by introducing structural reliance on service ecosystems and reducing individual cognitive sovereignty. To analyze these dynamics, the article introduces the Autonomy-Enabling Ratio (AER), a novel metric for assessing the extent of cognitive autonomy within connected environments. AER captures the ratio between autonomous and externally regulated scenarios of knowledge, education, and professional practice, providing a tool to identify algorithmic overreach and the erosion of human agency.

A significant element of the digital environment, in general, and educational, in particular, is the dialogue, the role of which has both cognitive and ideological, existential, social aspects. The purpose of the research is a philosophical analysis of the digital transformation of dialogue in the context of the educational process, an assessment of its potential and impact on the individual. The research methodology has a complex, interdisciplinary character and is associated with the application of an existential approach to understanding the essence of dialogue (M. Bakhtin, M. Buber, G. Marcel, E. Levinas), the theory of the development of individual thinking by L.S. Vygotsky, developed by the author of the theories of electronic (digital) culture and based on modern developments in the field of the introduction of digital tools in education. The study shows that dialogue in the digital learning environment becomes not so much a form of rapprochement, integration of subjects, as a form of autonomy, isolation, individuals, which changes the nature of learning and has social and existential consequences. This creates the need to transform the digital learning environment when using it from the position of supplementing it with ethical, socio-psychological and emotional components and support tools for the student. Based on the existential-axiological analysis, the positive and risky features of digital dialogue as one of the phenomena of electronic culture and online learning tools are revealed. The concept of digital dialogue in learning, the characteristics of its features, functions, role and influence on the learner in the digital environment are presented. The difficulties of dialogic learning characteristic of the digital environment are revealed, recommendations of a methodological and methodical nature for application in the education system are presented.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Windhager and Mayr argue that digital humanities tools exemplify distributed cognition in practice, yet often lack explicit theoretical grounding. They propose that extended mind and distributed cognition theories provide productive frameworks for understanding how visualization tools and computational methods extend humanistic inquiry. The paper bridges philosophical theorizing about extended cognition with practical tool design in digital humanities.

  RELEVANCE: This application of extended mind theory to digital humanities tools illustrates how cognitive extension operates in knowledge work contexts. The focus on visualization as cognitive extension highlights non-linguistic forms of digitally-mediated cognition. The case demonstrates how theoretical frameworks from philosophy can inform practical tool design while being refined through application.

  abstract = {Digital humanists have often been criticized as too technology-driven and for a lack of theoretical work. In this paper, we discuss theories from Cognitive Science on the extended mind, which provide a productive framework to theorize the use of tools and technologies for the sake of cognitive self-enhancement. Viewed through this lens, humans continuously self-amplify their natural cognitive resources and processes by extending and offloading them to interactions with artifacts and other individuals in their environment. Concepts of extended cognition further sharpen the focus on multiple types of distribution: from the outlined internal-external distribution to the propositional-visual distribution of cognition, but also for the multi-instrumental distribution across multiple types of tools and tool specialist. All these aspects are relevant for future debates about a “theory gap” in the digital humanities: DH mainly builds external, technological tools, while traditional humanities develop conceptual tools—including theories—to enable and enhance the study of complex cultural phenomena. Notwithstanding the value of confrontational discussions, we argue for the benefits of understanding the strengths and limitations of instruments on both sides—and for working toward future synergies and ecologies of the humanities’ tools and minds. In this regard, we show how visualization-based DH tools might might play a major role in closing the comprehensibility gap of traditional theories in the arts and humanities.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Leshkevich examines cognitive technosymbiosis—the deep integration of human cognition with AI systems—and explores whether AI exhibits "subject-like" qualities. She warns against cognitive technodependence and "lazy brain" effects where reliance on ready-made AI solutions undermines independent thinking. The analysis distinguishes productive cognitive integration from problematic dependence, emphasizing reflexive comprehension and value-purpose imperatives.

  RELEVANCE: This work extends extended mind debates to AI-augmented cognition, where the external resource itself has computational capabilities. Leshkevich's concern with maintaining human agency and independent thought within symbiotic systems addresses normative questions about desirable forms of cognitive extension. The distinction between technosymbiosis and technodependence parallels debates about genuine extension versus mere causal support.

Conceptual thinking is opposed to “think­ing with technology” with the dominance of an obligatory set of digital functions and the ef­fect of “lazy brain”, when due to the habit of ready-made solutions a person loses the ability for independent mental search. A critical analysis of conceptual alignment in human-AI interactions is proposed based on a set of unambiguous concepts, which implies standardization and formalization of human thinking. The multifunctionality of the cognitive is shown, and the problem of cognitive inequality is analyzed. The focus is on the indirect signs of subjectivity of Artificial neural network, their autonomous and voluntary functioning, their capacity for self-learning and re-training, as well as the process of reprogramming they demonstrate. The author comes to conclusions about the importance of integrating the hu­man body and a high-tech machine, i.e. a brain computer interface; about the potential of cognitive techno-symbiosis based on the bionic approach. It is shown that the function­ing of Chat GPT, which tends to become a common technological option, makes it neces­sary to identify social shock absorbers.

Using comments from 126 undergraduate students in South Florida, this theoretical paper highlights concepts and concerns regarding AI challenges related to cheating, plagiarizing, and biased information. The worries about the impact of AI are analogous to what the internet was three decades ago. People were using the internet as it was being developed, fine-tuned, and improved; it felt like walking over a long and tall bridge as it was being built, and the same is true for the growth of AI. Drawing parallels with the internet’s transformative impact over the past three decades, this paper emphasizes that AI is poised to drive similar positive changes, fostering increased productivity, transparency, accountability, and ethics, but at a much faster pace. In the meantime, due to the availability of data and digital content, the virtual world increased misinformation, disinformation, bias, and prejudiced speech, which AI can easily exacerbate. While AI adoption may cause process-related disruptions, its integration into everyone’s daily life is inevitable. As a natural extension of the information superhighway, AI will usher in a new wave of innovation, ultimately and perpetually transforming the fabric of our personal and professional lives. Drawing on literature and recent trends forecasted by experts, this theoretical manuscript provides an overview of AI uses, its history, challenges, and ethical implications for us all. The conceptual paper ends with recommendations for educators, managers, entrepreneurs, and human resources professionals to create awareness regarding the benefits of this new endemic technology, to ease people’s anxiety, and to reduce or mitigate hallucinations so AI tools can be used to enhance everyone’s effectiveness and efficiency.},

  abstract = {In this short but provocative book, the authors defend a radically enactivist philosophy of mind, upon which all but the most linguistically sophisticated cognitive and perceptual processes are free from representational content. The target of Hutto and Myin's critique is thus not only the standard opponent of the enactivist tradition -- namely, accounts of the mind that treat it in classical intentionalist or information-processing terms -- but also more moderate forms of enactivism itself, plus its close cousins the embodied, embedded, and extended theories of mind. Proponents of the latter views, although their themes and concerns are broadly consonant with radical enactivism in challenging neurocentricism and emphasising the active and world-engaging nature of cognition and perception, are deemed to remain in the grip of an unsustainable background commitment to representationalist thinking. A truly thoroughgoing anti-representationalism, the authors believe, is the logical outcome of the enactivist programme, and it is the role of the book to lay out the groundwork for such a project.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Much of the volume is devoted to delivering a sequence of arguments which aim to force the fan of content to retreat to an ever-narrower conception of when and where representational states are required, with a view to showing that only those creatures with substantial conceptual powers, scaffolded by public language, need be described in content-involving terms. The core proposal is the so-called Hard Problem of Content (chapter 4): the challenge of accommodating the essential features of intentional states -- their truth, reference, accuracy and logical properties -- in naturalistic terms. Reflective scrutiny reveals, the authors argue, that the notion of content as causally efficacious, and hence as serving to explain an individual's intelligent behaviour, is unfounded. Hutto and Myin examine familiar existing naturalistic theories of content, and find them unable to answer the Hard Problem. Models of content that appeal to patterns of reliable causal covariation holding between external states of affairs and components of internal processing systems (e.g., Dretske, 1981), and which rely upon a robust conception of information, are found to be unsuccessful in virtue of failing to explain the relevant truth-bearing properties. A relation of correspondence or indication, however reliable, explains nothing more than the conditions under which an internal state will be tokened; it reveals nothing about what the state "says" or "means".

Underpinning this criticism is the authors' scepticism about the explanatory usefulness of the traditional conception of informational content; naturally occurring meaning that can be transmitted and communicated, picked up and passed on, by biological organisms. The content enthusiast is, Hutto and Myin believe, forced into a dilemma here: either accept that information is nothing but causal covariance, in which case it is not a type of content proper; or hold that content is an irreducible, albeit natural, property of some physical systems (on the model of Chalmers' (2010) non-reductive analysis of qualia). A surprising omission from the chapter on naturalised theories of content is Fodor's (1987) asymmetric dependency thesis, which escapes the authors' critical attention. Perhaps they view it as susceptible to the objections that they take to face causal-covariation accounts, but more work would need to be done to demonstrate that Fodor's additional conditions -- which are after all in place in order to distance his position from simpler alternatives -- provide no way to respond to these challenges.

Teleosemantic theories of content do come under the spotlight, and are judged to fare equally poorly in meeting the demands of the Hard Problem (p71). Accounts of this sort (e.g., Dretske, 1995; Millikan, 1984, 1993) understand the content of an intentional state to be determined by two factors: firstly by the information transmitted by a signal that is received by a system, and with which the state in question covaries, and secondly by the consumers of the state, and their proper functions. States of a creature's visual system, for example, are said to represent features of the world in virtue of these states' consumers having the proper function of responding to signals that indicate those features. As Hutto and Myin point out, teleofunctional theories can accord varying weight to each of the two factors in giving an account of intentional content -- the relevant burden may be shouldered by covariance; by consumption; or by some combination of the two. If they are correct that mere covariation or indication cannot suffice for genuine content, they continue, then the prospects for a teleofunctionalism that relies heavily on the first factor are slim: there are no pre-existing natural meanings out in the world, ready to be consumed. On the other hand, a consumer-emphasising semantics struggles with the perennial problem of accounting for the intensional nature of contentful states: "biology lacks the resources for specifying under which guise such states might represent what they target" (p79).

In a more novel strategem, Hutto and Myin note that a pure consumer-semantic theory (what they call the Strengthened Millikan Maneuver (p75) upon which content is generated solely through the consumption of states, and does not pre-exist this consumption) is, in spirit if not in detail, closely akin to the core tenets of enactivism itself. Where the former speaks of content-creating systems within an organism, the latter talks of the organism's bringing forth meaning and value on the basis of its autonomy. On both programmes, the most basic forms of directedness are biological dealings, respondings, and strivings, all of which -- on Hutto and Myin's view -- can be understood as 'meaningful' for the organism without strict representationalist talk of reference, truth, or accuracy.

Hutto and Myin's anti-representationalist challenges aim to undermine not only these traditional neurocentric approaches to naturalising content, but also more recent embodied-embedded theories of cognition and perception whose explanatory resources include minimal, bodily or action-oriented representations. Sensorimotor theories of perception (e.g., Noë, 2004), upon which experience is said to be mediated by an implicit knowledge of the sensory consequences of skilful, exploratory movement, are said to over-intellectualise a creature's perceptual engagement with her environment by treating this implicit understanding as conceptual in nature. Radical enactivism, in contrast, considers perception to be non-predicative -- experiences do not attribute properties to objects -- and unmediated by stored representational content.

The negative, critical element of Hutto and Myin's discussion is largely compelling, and weighs against an unreflective acceptance of intentionalist thinking about the mind. Less satisfying, however, is the level of detail they offer concerning radical enactivism's alternative to representationalist explanations of mentality. One area where readers may reasonably expect a further degree of analysis is that of the structure of perceptual experience. The claim that perceptual states are non-predicative -- that they do not attribute properties such as shape, size, and colour to objects -- is counter-intuitive, and the authors offer little in the way of a replacement account of the phenomenology of how thingsdoappear in experience. We are told that perceivers are "aspectual respondents" (p121): things can look or feel a certain way to an individual, without their representing anything as being thus and so. Radical enactivism treats experience as a direct engagement with the physical world; it aims to align itself with the sensorimotor approach whilst jettisoning its talk of implicit understanding or representational mediation. But this is to neglect the explanatory work that is performed by such knowledge on the sensorimotor model, namely in providing an understanding of the conscious subject's access to perceptual constancies: the ability to keep track, in perception, of the invariant features of objects in addition to their appearances (looks, feels, sounds). Sensorimotor theories show how aspectual respondents can come to perceive these unchanging properties amid the evolving patterns of motor-induced sensory stimulation. Without this representational component, it appears to be a consequence of radical enactivism that only linguistically expert agents are capable of seeing the observer-independent properties of objects (their shapes, spatial distribution, size, and so forth) at all, and this is a difficult bullet to bite.

From the non-predicative account of perception, with its rejection of associated correctness conditions, it follows that the distinction between veridical and illusory experience is hard for the radical enactivist to draw. Hutto and Myin believe that the standard intentionalist account of misperception as misrepresentation is unsuccessful because it depends upon ascribing to experience an unsustainable kind of content, a content that is both propositional and introspectively accessible, and is reliant upon high-level interpretative capacities being in play (pp124-5). Not only are creatures with basic minds, who are without fully-formed conceptual abilities, thus unable to undergo perceptual illusions, it is difficult to see how to resist this conclusion even for adult human perceivers once perception is understood to be content-free across the board.},

Traditional approaches define cognitive systems in an agent-relative way, that is, via top-down functional decomposition that assumes a cognitive agent as starting point. The extended cognition movement challenged that approach by questioning the primacy of the notion of cognitive agent. In response, [Adams, F., and K. Aizawa. 2001. The Bounds of Cognition. Oxford, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.] suggested that to have a clear understanding of what a cognitive system is we may need to solve "the demarcation challenge": the problem of identifying a reliable way to determine which mechanisms that are causally responsible for the production of a certain cognitive process constitute a cognitive system responsible for such process and which ones do not. Recently, [Rupert, R. 2009. Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind. Oxford: Oxford University Press.] offered a solution based on the idea that the mechanisms that constitute a cognitive system are integrated in a particular sense. In this paper I critically review Rupert's solution and argue against it. Additionally, I argue that a successful account of cognitive system must accommodate the fact that the neural mechanisms causally responsible for the production of a cognitive process are diachronically dynamic and yet functionally stable. At the end, I offer a suggestion as to how to accommodate this diachronic dynamicity without losing functional stability.

  abstract = {Walter (2013) argues in that a bunch of externalist approaches examined in the theory of mind is interesting for psychiatry—especially for biological psychiatry. The externalist approaches state that mental states are not only constituted by internal but also by external factors. He subsumes them under the so-called 4E-thesis: embodied, embedded, extended, enacted. His example is concerned with ADHD such that ADHD is only existent “in an environment that favors attentional distraction and punishes hyperactivity.” 
  abstract_source = {s2},
 
First, using the 4E-thesis seems to be explanatorily attractive: There are factors of the disorder that can be grouped as external constituents and these constituents are not named by internalist vocabulary. For example, punishment is for sure not part of internalist vocabulary. 
 
But there is a figure of a principal argument against using the 4E-thesis in psychiatry. Consider this cookbook theory of the 4E-thesis: 
 
 
Cookbook theory for the 4E-thesis in accord with Henrik Walter's multilevel-approach: 
 
 
There is the phenomenon of a psychiatric disorder instanced in the form of multilevel-complexes. 
 
 
There are embodied, embedded, extended, or enacted (4E) constituents of cognition that realize the cognitive systems. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for the 4E-constituents. 
 
 
Coupled systems of individuated 4E-constituents individuate a multilevel-complex. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for systems of constituents C that realize multilevel-complexes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example, with respect to extended cognition, the cookbook theory is the following: 
 
 
Cookbook theory of extended cognition: 
 
 
There is the phenomenon of cognition of a group of patients in psychiatry instanced in the form of cognitive systems of a specific structure. 
 
 
There are vehicles of cognition that realize the cognitive systems named in 1. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for vehicles named in 2. 
 
 
Coupled systems of individuated vehicles individuate a cognitive system. 
 
 
There are individuation criteria for systems of vehicles of cognition that realize cognitive systems named in 1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As one can see, every attempt of the 4E-thesis needs criteria marking where to stop adding externalist constituents to the constituent base of the psychiatric disorder. For example, extended cognition-constituents should not include the whole world to make the thesis an interesting thesis—otherwise every phenomenon to be explained by extended cognition is constituted by the same constituents (i.e., the whole world). But what kind of criterion can the 4E-externalist provide us with? 
 
First, the 4E-externalist could give a criterion based on intrinsic properties of systems realizing disorders. But as a detailed analysis of criteria of this kind by Adams and Aizawa (2001, 2010) shows, these criteria are regularly based on finding a mark of the cognitive—which seems to be a hopeless endeavor without being a fundamentalist who just adds axiomatically this criterion to the cookbook theory. 
 
But second, the 4E-externalist could maybe give a criterion based on extrinsic properties of systems realizing psychiatric disorders. For example, one could use reliability as a stop-criterion for delineating what is coupled (with respect to point 4 in the cookbook theories). What is reliably coupled builds a constituent base of a system realizing a psychiatric disorder. But as a detailed analysis shows, this is not the case (Bukow and Will, in press). With respect to different criteria of reliability, there are very different reliable systems. This is not trivial, because in accord with the cookbook theory-approach, Bukow and Will argue: 
 
 
Argument for the arbitrariness of the reliability-predicate: 
 
 
Assume the cookbook theory of extended cognition. 
 
 
Give a definition of reliability with an operationalization (e.g., reproducibility as an operationalization). 
 
 
Choose an experimental procedure to test for reliability based on interaction between systems (because reliability is relative to this experimental procedure). 
 
 
Choose a value X%, i.e., that the experimental procedure is reproducible in X% of all series of experiments. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no established decision procedure for the needed choices in points 3 and 4. And whatever procedure you choose, you may get different values for X% which will lead the psychiatrist to different constituent bases of the psychiatric disorder to be explained. Bukow and Will analyze in detail other candidates for criteria based on extrinsic properties, for example functional roles, causal roles, or heuristics. 
 
 
Now, there are two horns for the 4E-externalist: 
 
Horn 1: Use a stop-criterion based on intrinsic properties. The critics of Adam and Aizawa bite the proponent of this kind of criterion. If you add the criterion axiomatically, then you are a fundamentalist and not a scientist. 
 
Horn 2: Use a stop-criterion based on extrinsic properties. Then, there is the need to show in detail how to use such a criterion—which seems to be hopeless in accord with the investigation above. If you add the criterion without detailed analysis, then you are using just so-stories, without guarantee that the criterion fulfills its job. 
 
 
 
 
For these reasons, using the 4E-thesis is tempting but dangerous—there is no well-founded stop-criterion in philosophy of mind that a psychiatrist could use—not in a detailed way and not in a rough way. It is arbitrary what type and what token the psychiatrist may use with respect to the selection of constituents of a disorder. In a principal debate, the 4E-proponent may excuse these deficits because nobody may give in principal such stop-criteria. But in psychiatry, principal deficits are no excuse for misuse. Arbitrariness can smooth the way for use—but also for misuse in psychiatry, which is a dangerous zone with respect to rights and needs of patients of psychiatry. And if a psychiatrist can only give arbitrary constituent bases to a patient's disorder, then disorder and treatment will only arbitrarily be defined. This is, as far as I can see, an objection against Henrik Walter's argument for a mature “third wave” biological psychiatry.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews Adams & Aizawa's book favorably but argues their
  mark of the cognitive (non-derived content) is neither necessary nor
  sufficient for grounding intracranialism. Instead defends systems-based
  approach: cognitive systems are individuated by persisting organizational
  structures with dense causal integration. Brain-based systems exhibit this
  integration while brain-plus-notebook systems typically do not, making the
  distinction empirical rather than conceptual.

  RELEVANCE: Shows diversity within internalist camp—Rupert agrees with Adams
  & Aizawa's conclusion (intracranialism) but rejects their argument (mark of
  the cognitive). Suggests internalist position can be defended on multiple
  grounds. For offloading research, supports focusing on causal integration
  and organizational persistence rather than intrinsic content as basis for
  individuating cognitive systems.

  POSITION: Systems-based internalism defending intracranialism on grounds of
  causal integration rather than intrinsic properties.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies systems-based approach to predictive processing
  framework. Argues that predictive processing supports intracranialism rather
  than extended mind because prediction error minimization mechanisms are
  densely integrated within neural hierarchies but only loosely coupled to
  external resources. Self-model emerges from internal predictive dynamics
  embedded in but not extended into environment.

  RELEVANCE: Shows how internalist position engages with recent predictive
  processing framework. For offloading research, suggests predictive processing
  may offer alternative to extended mind: external resources modulate
  prediction errors without being incorporated into prediction-generating
  system. Raises question whether offloading is better understood as strategic
  niche construction for prediction error management.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Articulates predictive processing framework as unifying
  theory of perception, action, and cognition. Brains are hierarchical
  prediction machines that minimize prediction error through cascading
  top-down predictions and bottom-up error signals. This framework naturally
  extends to action: acting on environment to make predictions come true
  (active inference). Argues predictive processing supports extended mind by
  showing how external resources participate in prediction error minimization
  loops.

  RELEVANCE: Major theoretical framework potentially unifying extended mind
  with neuroscience. For offloading research, suggests reframing: offloading
  as strategic manipulation of environment to reduce prediction error or
  computational load of prediction generation. Action and perception become
  symmetric ways of minimizing error—"perception is controlled hallucination,
  action is self-fulfilling prophecy."

  through active inference and prediction error minimization across brain-
  environment boundaries.

  abstract = {Abstract Brains, it has recently been argued, are essentially prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues predictive processing supports internalism rather than
  extended mind. The brain's task is to infer hidden causes of sensory input
  from behind "evidentiary boundary" of sensory surfaces. This creates
  principled cognitive boundary at sensory periphery: prediction error
  minimization mechanisms are internal to evidentiary boundary, while external
  world is what predictions are about. Action changes sensory input but remains
  external to prediction-generating system. Extended mind conflates being
  predicted with being part of predictor.

  RELEVANCE: Alternative to Clark's reading of predictive processing—same
  framework, opposite implications for extended mind. For offloading research,
  suggests distinction between external resources that generate prediction
  errors (outside cognitive system) and internal mechanisms that process those
  errors (inside cognitive system). Offloading would be strategic manipulation
  of error sources, not cognitive extension.

The purpose of the present paper is to challenge the view that PP entails a wholesale rejection of positions that are interested in the embodied, embedded, extended, or enactive dimensions of cognitive processes. I will argue that Hohwy's argument from analogy, which forces an evidentiary boundary into the picture, lacks the argumentative resources to make a convincing case for the conceptual necessity to interpret PP in solely internalistic terms. For this reason, I will reconsider the postulation and explanatory role of the evidentiary boundary. I will arrive at an account of prediction error minimization and its foundation on the free energy principle that is fully consistent with approaches to cognition that emphasize the embodied and interactive properties of cognitive processes. This gives rise to the suggestion that explanatory pluralism about the application of PP is to be preferred over Hohwy's explanatory monism that follows from his internalistic and neurocentric view of predictive cognitive systems.},

  abstract = {The titleJoint Venturesalludes to Goldman's view that understanding cognition requires both scientific and philosophical expertise. "It would be", he notes, "intellectually irresponsible to ignore the huge swaths of evidence and theory that science has generated" (p. 3). Nevertheless, there is "ample place for philosophers to make theoretical contributions, to argue for this or that theoretical interpretation as the best explanation of the data" (p. 3). Cognitive science is thus a joint venture between philosophy and the behavioral sciences (p. 2). The rich and fascinating essays in this collection are testimony to Goldman's vision. The volume focuses on four themes to which he has made important contributions: simulation theory, empathy, embodied cognition, and the metaphysics of action. I will focus on the first three themes because they are striking examples of the "joint ventures" program.
  abstract_source = {ndpr},

Goldman has been a central figure in the study of mindreading for the last quarter of a century. The term "mindreading" refers to the capacity to predict others' behavior and explain it by attributing mental states to them. This capacity is also commonly referred to as "theory of mind". However, as Goldman points out, "theory of mind" confuses mindreading with a model of mindreading (p. 20). (This will become apparent in a moment.)

Broadly speaking, three models of mindreading exist in the literature (Ch. 1):

1.Theory-theory. Mindreading centrally involves the possession of a theory of mind ("folk psychology") which is deployed in roughly the same way that scientists deploy empirical theories to predict and explain aspect of the natural world.

2.The intentional stance. Mindreading involves taking a "stance" towards other people. They are assumed to be rational agents and the beliefs and desires attributed to them are those that a fully rational agent would have in the target's circumstances. The agent's behavior is predicted on the basis of the attributed states.

3.Simulation theory. The mindreader adopts the target's perspective and determines what she (the mindreader) would do if she were the target. That is, she uses her own mental processors to simulate those of the target, thereby predicting their behavior.

Goldman is without doubt the most significant simulation theorist. His earliest contribution greatly clarified simulation theory, moving it away from loose metaphors such as "putting oneself in the other's shoes" ('Interpretation Psychologized',Mind and Language4: 161-85, 1989). His views are best understood using the terminology, developed by Stephen Stich and Shaun Nichols, of "pretend inputs" and "off-line outputs" ('Folk psychology: Simulation or Tacit Theory?',Mind and Language7: 35-71, 1992). The pretend belief thatphas the same impact on practical decision making as the belief thatp, but differs from the belief thatpbecause it originates in different mental processes. Beliefs arise from perception and memory, and by reasoning from other beliefs; pretend beliefs arise from what is often called the "pretend belief and desire generator". Similarly, the pretend desire thatqhas the same impact on practical decision making as the desire thatq,but also arise from the pretend belief and desire generator.

In a successful episode of mindreading, the mindreader generates pretend beliefs and desires corresponding to the target's beliefs and desires. Provided the mindreader's decision making processes are sufficiently similar to the target's, she will arrive at a decision similar to the target's. However, the mindreader's decision does not lead directly to behavior; rather, her practical decision making processors are "off-line", with the decision leading to a prediction about the target's behavior (pp. 51-2).},
