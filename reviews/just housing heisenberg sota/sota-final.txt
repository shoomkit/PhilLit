## Section 1: Introduction - The Temporal Puzzle of Housing as a Located Good

Housing is fundamentally different from the fungible goods assumed by standard theories of distributive justice. Unlike income that can be redistributed or personal property that can be moved, housing value is inseparable from location. This insight, developed by Fred Hirsch's (1976) analysis of "positional goods," reveals a crucial feature of spatial resources: they cannot simply be expanded to meet demand. A good school, safe neighborhood, or proximity to employment opportunities exists in a specific place—if everyone could access the best locations, those locations would lose their value. Urban economics confirms this intuition with striking empirical magnitudes: agglomeration economies create wage premiums of 10-30% in productive cities (Combes and Gobillon 2015), while five metropolitan areas alone—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Boston—hold 48% of all US urban land value, exceeding $2 trillion (Albouy and Shin 2018). These are not marginal differences but fundamental economic realities that shape life opportunities.

This non-fungibility creates a distinctive justice problem when temporal claims conflict. Consider the competing claims that arise in gentrifying neighborhoods: longtime residents assert rights based on past occupancy, place attachment accumulated through years of residence, investment in community institutions, and life plans built around specific spatial arrangements (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018). Newcomers counter with claims based on current housing need, equal access to opportunity-rich locations, and rights to non-discriminatory housing allocation. Future generations assert claims to housing in productive cities where employment and opportunity concentrate. Each claim appears prima facie legitimate, yet not all can be satisfied given spatial scarcity. Standard distributive justice frameworks struggle to adjudicate among these temporally-structured claims.

The theoretical challenge runs deep. Rawlsian distributive justice treats primary goods as all-purpose means that can be redistributed across society (Rawls 1971), but this framework assumes goods are fungible—location-neutral resources that any rational person values regardless of life plan. Housing defies this assumption. One cannot simply transfer "good location" from San Francisco to Detroit; the value is intrinsically tied to place. Property theory focuses on ownership rights and legitimate acquisition (Locke 1988, Nozick 1974), but this misses occupancy-based claims of renters who constitute the majority in many urban areas yet lack ownership. Historical justice theories address past wrongs and rectification (Waldron 1992, Thompson 2002, Butt 2009), but leave unresolved how long historical claims persist and when changed circumstances might supersede them. Should historical displacement from a neighborhood create permanent claims, or do demographic transformation and economic development eventually override such claims?

The empirical stakes are not marginal. Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) landmark study demonstrates that housing supply constraints in just three cities—New York, San Francisco, and San Jose—reduced US GDP growth by 36% between 1964 and 2009. The mechanism is straightforward but devastating: exclusionary zoning and land use regulations raised housing costs in high-productivity cities, preventing workers from migrating to where they would be more productive. This is not merely an efficiency loss; it is a justice issue affecting who can access location-specific opportunities. Regional income convergence—the process by which poor states caught up to rich states from 1880-1980—halted after 1980 precisely because housing costs in high-income states created barriers preventing low-skilled workers from migrating to opportunity (Ganong and Shoag 2017). Attorneys can still afford to move to expensive coastal cities where housing costs 21% of their income, but janitors cannot when rent consumes 52% of earnings.

This review organizes the literature around three key debates that structure contemporary scholarship. First, the autonomy versus derivative status of spatial justice: must we develop distinctive principles for located goods, or can mainstream distributive frameworks (Rawls, Dworkin, Sen) be extended to accommodate spatial concerns? Proponents of autonomous spatial justice (Soja 2010, Harvey 1973) argue geography itself produces inequality requiring independent normative analysis, while critics contend spatial justice merely applies general principles to geographic contexts (Moroni 2020). Second, the supersession debate: do historical injustices create persistent obligations that survive changing circumstances, or can demographic shifts and economic transformation morally supersede earlier claims? Waldron's (1992) supersession thesis has sparked decades of debate, with recent work by Meyer and Waligore (2022) and Truccone (2024) developing sophisticated frameworks for when and how supersession might apply. Third, the incumbent versus newcomer tension: how should we balance occupancy-based rights protecting established residents (Stilz 2009, 2013, 2019; Moore 2015; Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) against access rights enabling newcomers to pursue opportunities in productive cities (Anderson 2010)?

These debates are not merely academic. Housing policy must navigate the temporal dimension of place-based claims: who has legitimate expectations to remain in a neighborhood? What duties do communities have to accommodate newcomers? How should we weigh past investment against current need and future opportunity? This review establishes that temporal claims to located goods require distinctive theoretical treatment, not merely application of existing distributive frameworks. The non-fungibility of location, the path dependency of urban spatial configurations, and the empirical magnitude of exclusion's costs together demand normative analysis that takes time, place, and the persistence of historical arrangements seriously.
## Section 2: Located Goods and the Limits of Standard Distributive Justice

### The Fungibility Assumption in Mainstream Theory

Modern distributive justice theory largely assumes goods are fungible—resources that maintain their value regardless of spatial allocation. Rawls's (1971) theory of justice defines primary goods as "all-purpose means" that any rational person wants regardless of their specific life plan: rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, and the social bases of self-respect. Crucially, these goods are conceived as location-neutral. The difference principle permits inequalities only when they benefit the least advantaged, but this distributive logic assumes we can identify "the least advantaged" independently of where they live and redistribute resources accordingly. Dworkin's (1981) equality of resources employs a desert island auction thought experiment where shipwrecked people bid for resource bundles using equal initial endowments; distribution is just when no one envies another's bundle. This "envy test" presupposes that goods can be bundled and allocated such that everyone receives a package they find acceptable relative to others.

The problem becomes acute when we recognize housing as non-fungible. We cannot simply auction "good locations" without remainder—someone must necessarily live in less productive, less opportunity-rich cities. Spatial scarcity is not like scarcity of ordinary goods that can be produced in greater quantities to meet demand. Desirable neighborhoods face absolute limits: as Hirsch (1976) argued, positional goods derive their value precisely from relative scarcity, and attempts to expand access destroy the value being sought. If everyone lived in the best location, that location would cease to be best.

### Alternative Frameworks: Pluralism, Capabilities, and Relational Egalitarianism

Recognition of located goods' special character has prompted three major theoretical responses. Walzer's (1983) spheres of justice rejects monistic distributive principles in favor of "complex equality" where different goods (healthcare, education, political power, housing) are distributed according to principles appropriate to their social meanings. Crucially, Walzer argues against "dominance"—success in one sphere (wealth) should not automatically convert to success in others (housing). This suggests housing allocation should follow its own distributive logic rather than simple market mechanisms. However, Walzer's framework, while recognizing housing as a distinct sphere, does not specify which principles should govern spatial goods specifically. The social meanings of housing may themselves be contested, and pluralism alone does not resolve conflicts between competing temporal claims.

The capabilities approach (Sen 1999, Nussbaum 2011) offers a second alternative by shifting focus from resources to what people can actually do and be. Sen argues that justice requires capability equality—expanding the real freedoms people enjoy to achieve functionings they value. This framework naturally accommodates located goods because the same resources yield different capabilities in different places. A given income provides different educational opportunities depending on school quality; the same housing affords different employment access depending on location. Basta (2016) develops this insight through the concept of "spatial primary goods"—location-dependent resources like safe housing, mobility infrastructure, and public space access that shape capability conversion. Israel and Frenkel (2018) operationalize spatial justice using Sen's capabilities combined with Bourdieu's forms of capital (economic, cultural, social, symbolic), demonstrating empirically how geographic location affects opportunities. However, critics note that Nussbaum's sufficientarian capability list inadequately captures housing's positional and relational dimensions (Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025). Segregation by income or race affects capabilities even when absolute housing quality meets minimum thresholds, because self-respect depends on comparative status and social recognition. The capabilities approach illuminates why location matters but struggles with the relative dimensions of spatial goods.

Relational egalitarianism provides a third alternative by focusing on social relations rather than distributive patterns. Anderson (1999) argues that egalitarian justice aims to create a community where people relate as equals, eliminating oppression and domination rather than merely equalizing outcomes. Democratic equality requires citizens relate politically as equals, enjoy equal social standing, and possess capabilities to function as equals in social cooperation. Young (1990) similarly critiques the distributive paradigm for treating justice as static allocation of goods while ignoring processes, power structures, and cultural dimensions. Applied to spatial justice, relational frameworks emphasize whether urban arrangements create relations of equality or hierarchy. Shelby's (2016) analysis of segregated "dark ghettos" demonstrates how concentrated disadvantage violates reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, and civic equality. Anderson's (2010) case for residential integration argues that segregation perpetuates inequality across all dimensions—education, employment, wealth, health, political power—making integration a moral imperative. However, this creates tension with incumbent protection: prioritizing integration may require overriding established communities' preferences and disrupting place attachments that residents value.

### Spatial Justice: Autonomous or Derivative?

These theoretical developments prompt a fundamental question: does spatial distribution constitute an autonomous domain of justice requiring distinctive principles, or does it merely apply general justice principles to geographic contexts? Soja (2010) and Harvey (1973) argue for autonomy—that geography itself produces and reproduces injustice, not merely distributing pre-existing inequality. Spatial arrangements actively generate disadvantage through mechanisms like locational discrimination, exclusionary zoning, and uneven development patterns. Harvey's Marxist analysis shows how capitalism creates unjust urban space through the spatial fix for accumulation crises and commodification of land. Soja establishes "spatial justice" as a distinct field examining both fair distribution across space and just production of space itself. The "right to the city" becomes a collective democratic right to reshape urbanization according to human needs rather than profit imperatives.

Moroni (2020) offers an important critique, arguing that spatial justice is derivative from general principles applied to geographic contexts. He distinguishes institutional justice (concerning rules governing property, land use, and governance) from spatial justice (concerning geographic distributions), contending that institutions are the primary subject of justice. Spatial patterns reflect underlying institutional frameworks—property rights systems, zoning laws, governance structures—and addressing these institutions is the proper target of justice theory. On this view, we need good institutions more than we need autonomous spatial justice principles. Spatial outcomes that appear unjust should be remedied through institutional reform applying established justice principles, not through developing new geographically-specific principles.

This debate matters for housing justice. If spatial justice is autonomous, we might need wholly new principles for allocating located goods that standard distributive frameworks cannot provide. If spatial justice is derivative, existing theories can accommodate geographic considerations through proper institutional design. The synthesis view emerging from recent work (Basta 2016, Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025, Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) suggests that located goods may require specific principles while remaining connected to general justice frameworks. Housing presents distinctive challenges—non-fungibility, positional scarcity, community embeddedness, temporal attachment—that standard theories inadequately address, yet these challenges are not wholly separate from broader questions of equality, capability, and social relations. Located goods call for theoretical development that bridges general principles with spatial specificity.

What remains under-theorized is precisely the temporal dimension that housing exemplifies. Even frameworks recognizing location's importance tend to focus on synchronic distribution at a moment in time rather than diachronic claims across time. How do competing temporal claims—incumbents' historical attachment versus newcomers' current needs versus future generations' opportunity access—fit within these frameworks? This question becomes acute in the context of gentrification, climate displacement, and exclusionary housing policies, where temporal priority conflicts with access rights. To address these tensions, we must examine how justice theories handle time explicitly—the topic of temporal justice.
## Section 3: Temporal Justice and the Supersession Debate

### Waldron's Supersession Thesis

The temporal dimension of justice concerns how obligations and entitlements evolve across time. Waldron's (1992) "supersession thesis" provides the conceptual foundation for these debates: if a historical injustice occurs at time T1 creating an unjust distribution, morally relevant changes in circumstances can occur such that at time T2, justice no longer requires (and may prohibit) rectification to the original distribution. Waldron uses indigenous land claims as his paradigm case. Centuries after colonial dispossession, population has grown dramatically, environments have changed, and new generations with their own legitimate needs have emerged. Under these altered circumstances, restoring original territorial distributions might create new injustices by displacing current occupants who bear no responsibility for historical wrongs. The thesis holds that what was unjust at T1 may become not-unjust (or differently-unjust) at T2, not because the original wrong disappears or is forgiven, but because circumstances change what justice requires going forward.

Applied to housing, supersession raises profound questions. Does gentrification-induced displacement constitute "morally relevant changed circumstances" that supersede earlier residents' historical claims? When urban neighborhoods undergo demographic transformation, economic development, or infrastructure investment, do these changes override occupancy rights established through decades of residence? Alternatively, might displacement itself constitute an injustice creating new historical claims? The supersession debate directly addresses whether temporal priority in housing allocation has persistent moral weight or can be overridden when circumstances evolve.

### Anti-Supersession Responses and the Persistence of Historical Claims

Critics have developed sophisticated responses challenging Waldron's thesis. Thompson (2002) defends robust intergenerational obligations within political societies. Nations as temporally extended entities must keep commitments and repair injustices of predecessors; each generation inherits both benefits and burdens from the past. Displacement—whether through colonial dispossession or urban renewal—creates enduring moral debts that persist across generations. The moral relationship between political communities and affected populations does not simply decay with time. Thompson's framework suggests that historical housing injustices (redlining, contract buying, forced displacement, discriminatory lending) create persistent rectificatory obligations for contemporary cities and housing authorities, regardless of how much time has passed or how circumstances have changed.

Butt (2009, 2012) develops a more nuanced framework identifying three temporal connections that sustain rectificatory obligations across time: benefit (unjust enrichment where current parties profit from past wrongs), entitlement (wrongful taking where resources were illegitimately appropriated), and responsibility (institutional succession where current entities inherit obligations of predecessor institutions). Each connection generates distinct rectificatory duties even when direct causation is attenuated. Contemporary property distributions reflect accumulated injustice: current homeowners benefit from decades of discriminatory policies that channeled wealth to white suburban neighborhoods, displaced communities have entitlement claims to what was wrongfully taken, and cities bear responsibility as successors to institutions that perpetrated urban renewal and redlining. Butt's trichotomy provides analytical framework for tracing how historical wrongs generate present obligations even when specific victims and perpetrators no longer exist.

Meyer and Waligore's (2022) sophisticated conceptual analysis refines the supersession debate through crucial distinctions. They differentiate partial supersession (some but not all rectificatory claims are overridden) from full supersession (historical claims entirely disappear), and dormant supersession (claims temporarily inactive but can reassert if circumstances change again) from final supersession (claims permanently extinguished). These distinctions reveal supersession's complexity: perhaps gentrification partially supersedes incumbent claims (weakening them without eliminating them entirely), or produces dormant supersession where claims might reassert if neighborhood circumstances change again. The framework raises critical empirical and normative questions: what counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances"? How do we distinguish changes that legitimately supersede claims from those that merely make rectification inconvenient? The analytical apparatus provides tools for thinking through temporal housing claims with precision, but leaves the substantive criteria to be developed.

### Diachronic versus Synchronic Justice

Goodin's (2010) concept of "temporal justice" expands distributive justice beyond monetary resources to include time—specifically discretionary time over which individuals have autonomous control after necessary tasks. The magnitude of gaps between discretionary time enjoyed by best and worst off measures temporal injustice. This framework has direct housing implications: long commutes from affordable housing reduce discretionary time, gentrification-induced displacement disrupts temporal rhythms of community participation and family life, and housing stability provides temporal security for long-term planning. Housing allocation affects not merely what people have but their control over time and life-course trajectory. Should justice assessments focus on moment-in-time distributions (synchronic), life-course patterns (diachronic), or intergenerational comparisons?

Bidadanure (2021) develops age-group justice theory combining complete life egalitarianism, lifespan prudence, and relational egalitarianism. Some inequalities between age groups matter independently of their diachronic impact—relational reasons for equality exist at each life stage. She distinguishes temporary age-group inequalities (acceptable if everyone experiences them across their complete life) from generational inequalities (problematic when temporary inequalities become permanent cohort stratification). Applied to housing: young adults priced out of urban housing face both age-group inequality (synchronic comparison with older homeowners) and potential generational inequality (diachronic concern if they never recover access that previous generations enjoyed). Whether housing exclusion constitutes injustice depends on temporal framing: is it temporary life-stage variation where people eventually gain access, or permanent cohort stratification where entire generations are excluded from urban opportunities that their parents accessed? The temporal framing fundamentally shapes normative assessment.

Truccone's (2024) comprehensive treatment of temporal justice argues that circumstances change over time affecting what justice requires (acknowledging supersession's insight), but insists this must be reconciled with—not chosen over—reparative justice imperatives. The core challenge is integrating backward-looking concerns (repairing historical wrongs) with forward-looking priorities (meeting current and future needs). Applied to housing, this means reconciling displaced communities' historical claims with current residents' established attachments and future generations' housing needs. Truccone's four-aspect framework structures analysis: (1) how does time itself affect justice requirements? (2) what connections link current actors to past injustices? (3) when do changed circumstances alter obligations? (4) what forms of reparation are appropriate? His synthesis approach refuses the false choice between reparative and distributive justice, insisting both must be integrated in temporal justice frameworks.

### Path Dependency and Moral Lock-In

Beyond direct historical injustice claims, path dependency creates distinctive temporal constraints on justice. Past decisions constrain present options even when those decisions were not themselves unjust. Baum-Snow's (2007) finding that each Interstate Highway ray through a central city reduced its population approximately 18% demonstrates how 1950s-70s infrastructure investments created suburban development patterns persisting today. These highways cannot easily be removed, suburban investment is sunk, and spatial configurations are locked in. Similarly, zoning regulations enacted decades ago continue shaping current housing markets. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) document that regulation, once adopted, tends to persist and strengthen—a ratchet effect where restrictive policies become institutionally entrenched even as circumstances change.

This raises a distinct normative question: does path dependency create obligations even absent direct historical wrongdoing? When current generations inherit spatial configurations that limit their choices—highway networks from the 1960s, zoning from the 1970s, segregated neighborhood patterns from redlining—do they have obligations to correct inherited spatial lock-in? The moral status of path-dependent constraints differs from explicit historical injustice but still shapes current opportunity structures. Ganong and Shoag's (2017) demonstration that land-use restrictions halted regional income convergence after 1980 shows how past regulatory choices constrain present mobility and opportunity for those who had no voice in those decisions. This suggests a category of "structural historical obligations" distinct from direct rectification: duties to address how inherited spatial configurations limit present justice, regardless of whether those configurations resulted from wrongful intent.

### Temporal Discounting and Intergenerational Claims

Caney's (2014) analysis of climate justice provides conceptual resources for housing's temporal dimension. Pure time discounting—discounting future people's interests simply because they exist later—constitutes unjust discrimination based on when people are alive. Temporal location should not affect moral weight. Applied to housing: should future residents' needs be discounted compared to current residents' attachment? Future generations will need housing in productive cities just as current generations do, yet political systems systematically favor current residents' interests (protection of property values, neighborhood character) over future needs (affordable housing access, climate-safe locations). Caney's argument against temporal discrimination suggests this asymmetry is unjust. However, epistemic uncertainty about the future complicates this: we know current residents' attachments and needs with certainty but must speculate about who will live where and what their needs will be.

Gosseries' (2023) comprehensive treatment of intergenerational justice emphasizes the challenge of temporal non-overlap: generations existing at different times cannot reciprocate, cooperate, or contract with each other. Yet housing policy inherently involves intergenerational claims. Current exclusionary zoning shapes opportunity structures for generations not yet born. Climate change will displace millions, creating housing needs in safe cities where current residents resist newcomers (Stilz 2024). Luoma and Moore (2024) argue that occupancy theory better handles rectification than pure historical entitlement precisely because current occupancy generates claims even without clean historical title—but historical injustice still matters for determining rectification duties. The temporal complexity is irreducible: we must weigh current occupancy claims, historical displacement, and future housing needs simultaneously, each operating on different temporal scales with different epistemic accessibility.

The supersession debate reveals that temporal justice for housing cannot simply apply timeless principles. How we frame the temporal scope of analysis—moment-in-time, life-course, intergenerational—fundamentally affects what justice requires. Historical claims persist through connections (benefit, entitlement, responsibility) but may be partial, dormant, or conditional depending on changed circumstances. Path dependency creates structural constraints even without direct wrongdoing. These temporal complexities demand frameworks that explicitly integrate past, present, and future—a challenge that occupancy rights theory addresses by grounding claims in temporally-established attachment to place.
## Section 4: Occupancy Rights and Place-Based Temporal Claims

### Stilz's Occupancy Theory

Stilz's (2009, 2013, 2019) occupancy theory provides the most systematic philosophical framework for understanding how temporal residence generates moral claims to place. Her account grounds territorial rights in three core values: occupancy (stable possession of geographical space needed for central life projects), basic justice (effective legal institutions), and collective self-determination (capacity for self-governance). The occupancy interest is foundational: people develop "located life plans"—projects, relationships, and commitments intertwined with specific places that cannot simply be relocated without fundamental disruption to agency and identity.

Occupancy rights, as Stilz theorizes them, differ critically from both property rights and mere possession. Unlike property, occupancy rights are not transferable—they attach to persons through their use and residence, not through market exchange. Unlike mere possession, which can be revoked at will, occupancy rights create legitimate expectations of stability and immunity from arbitrary removal. These rights establish through temporal residence: as people invest in place-specific projects, form non-transferable relationships, and build lives around particular spatial configurations, they acquire moral claims to remain that strengthen over time.

Crucially for housing justice debates, Stilz (2019) argues that occupancy rights can arise even after unjust dispossession. Present occupancy creates genuine moral claims despite a neighborhood's potentially unjust origins through redlining, urban renewal, or discriminatory policies. This independence from historical title helps address path dependency: current residents in neighborhoods shaped by past injustice have legitimate occupancy claims even though the spatial configuration itself resulted from wrongdoing. However, this independence does not eliminate rectificatory duties to those historically displaced—it creates a complex scenario where multiple parties have legitimate but conflicting claims.

Stilz's (2013) analysis of removal's wrongfulness establishes that displacement from one's place of occupancy constitutes a distinctive harm. Removal severs connections constitutive of identity and agency, disrupts the ability to be author of one's life commitments, and destroys investments in place-specific projects. Even with full compensation for material losses, displacement wrongs occupants because money cannot restore the particular relationships, community ties, and spatial familiarity that ground autonomous agency. This non-fungible character of place-based attachment explains why gentrification harms cannot be fully remedied through compensation or equivalent housing elsewhere—the value destroyed is location-specific.

### Territorial Rights Theory and Self-Determination

Moore's (2015) political self-determination theory extends occupancy thinking to collective territorial rights. Peoples—understood as groups of persons residing in territory and planning lives around relationship to it—have territorial rights through legitimate occupancy plus collective self-determination interests. Her framework identifies three foundations: individual moral rights of residency (each person's claim to stable residence), collective moral rights of occupancy (group claims emerging from shared residence), and peoples' rights to self-determination (capacity to make collective decisions about shared territorial life). Time matters fundamentally: longer occupancy strengthens both individual and collective claims by deepening attachment, thickening social relationships, and establishing institutional frameworks for self-governance.

Moore's account requires balancing past wrongs against present occupancy claims. Historical territorial injustices create obligations, but these must be weighed against current occupants' legitimate claims established through residence and self-determination. Applied to neighborhoods as sub-state territories, this framework suggests that residential communities constitute "peoples" with collective self-determination interests. Long-term residents have both individual residency rights (claims to stable housing in their neighborhood) and collective occupancy rights (shared claims to neighborhood character, governance, and future trajectory). Gentrification threatens territorial self-determination by disrupting the community's capacity to collectively determine its future, even when individual residents are not physically displaced.

Nine's (2012, 2022, 2025) alternative "river model" challenges assumptions of exclusive bounded territories. Her foundational territories concept envisions transnational, overlapping political units designed to manage shared resource systems that transcend traditional boundaries. Territory emerges from interdependence in managing watersheds, urban infrastructure, and overlapping economic systems. Neighborhoods exemplify foundational territories: residents share infrastructure, public spaces, and resource systems requiring collective management through nested and overlapping jurisdictions rather than exclusive control. This challenges winner-take-all displacement logic—perhaps neighborhoods can accommodate overlapping claims from established residents, newcomers, and broader city/regional populations, each with legitimate but partial territorial authority over different decision domains.

Miller's (2012) nationalist account grounds territorial rights in long-term occupancy and cultural integration with landscape. National communities develop claims through shaping territory across generations—building infrastructure, creating cultural landscapes, establishing institutions. While Miller focuses on nations, the logic potentially extends to neighborhood-level cultural communities that have similarly shaped local spaces over decades. This raises questions about which collectivities count as rights-bearing "peoples" for territorial purposes: nations certainly, but also cities, neighborhoods, ethnic enclaves, cultural communities?

### Urban Applications: Gentrification and Displacement Ethics

Huber and Wolkenstein's (2018) pioneering application of occupancy theory to gentrification establishes that displacement violates occupancy rights even for renters without property ownership. The "located life plans" concept captures how human projects depend on spatial stability: children's schools, employment proximity, social networks, religious communities, cultural institutions, and informal relationships all require geographic continuity. Gentrification-driven displacement disrupts these simultaneously, creating a compound harm distinct from simple distributive injustice. Even if displaced residents find equivalent housing by objective measures (same square footage, similar neighborhood income levels), they suffer irreplaceable loss of place-specific connections. The wrong persists even with compensation because the value destroyed—embeddedness in particular social and spatial networks—is non-fungible.

Krishnamurthy and Moore's (2024) recent work provides the most comprehensive philosophical account of gentrification's wrongfulness through a pluralistic framework. They identify three types of place-based rights that gentrification violates: rights to a home (secure shelter and private space for core life activities), rights of residency (stable political membership and participation in local governance), and place-based rights to community (valued social relationships tied to specific neighborhoods). Each right has temporal dimensions. Home rights require duration—temporary shelter cannot provide the stability needed for life planning. Residency rights strengthen over time through participation in local institutions and democratic processes. Community rights deepen as relationships thicken and collective practices become established across years or decades.

Their framework addresses standard objections effectively. First, occupancy rights don't depend on property ownership—renters develop all three types of place-based claims through residence. Second, the harms are not purely distributive—even if displaced residents receive compensation maintaining their economic position, they lose relational and participatory goods that money cannot replace. Third, occupancy rights don't require community homogeneity—diverse neighborhoods generate place-based rights just as culturally unified ones do, as residents develop attachments to the particular character of their community including its diversity. The pluralistic structure recognizes that gentrification wrongs along multiple dimensions simultaneously, explaining why simple policy responses (compensation, equivalent housing elsewhere) prove inadequate.

### Critical Challenges and Theoretical Limits

Van Leeuwen's (2025) critical examination exposes challenges for autonomy-based displacement accounts. If occupancy rights ground claims through autonomous life planning, what distinguishes wrongful displacement (gentrification) from legitimate relocation (moving for career opportunities, family reunification, personal choice)? Both disrupt located life plans, yet we treat them differently. The autonomy framework risks either over-generating objections (any relocation becomes problematic) or under-specifying when displacement specifically wrongs. Van Leeuwen pushes occupancy theorists to provide more precise criteria for legitimate versus illegitimate displacement, distinguishing voluntary from involuntary moves, and identifying which life plans merit protection through occupancy rights.

Operationalization challenges persist. When exactly does occupancy begin generating rights? Wells (2019) proposes minimum three years for lease-like security, but is this sufficient for deep attachment that Stilz and others emphasize, or too long for mobile populations? How much place-based investment is required—must one participate in local institutions, or does mere residence suffice? Can occupancy rights be forfeited through extended absence, and if so, how long? These questions require answers for occupancy theory to guide policy, yet philosophical work has not fully developed the criteria.

Newcomer exclusion presents perhaps the deepest tension. Strong occupancy rights protecting established residents risk entrenching segregation and exclusion. Anderson's (2010) integration imperative argues that residential segregation fundamentally perpetuates racial inequality across all life dimensions—education, employment, wealth accumulation, health, political power. Achieving integration may require overriding incumbent preferences and disrupting established communities. Kogelmann (2025) demonstrates that autonomy arguments cut both ways: anti-gentrification advocates cite displacement's autonomy violations, while pro-zoning advocates cite homeowners' autonomy to control their property and neighborhood. The same normative principle yields opposed policy conclusions, suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate the incumbent-newcomer tension.

Scale questions remain under-theorized. Do occupancy principles apply differently at individual household level versus community level? Nine's overlapping territories model suggests multiple scales of legitimate claims—individuals, neighborhoods, cities, regions—each with partial authority over different decision domains. But which scales should determine which housing decisions? If neighborhood occupancy rights ground anti-displacement claims, do they also ground exclusionary zoning authority? Or does the broader city/regional scale have legitimate interest in ensuring housing access that overrides neighborhood preferences?

Occupancy theory provides powerful conceptual resources for understanding why temporal duration matters morally—it proxies for depth of place-based life projects meriting protection. Displacement harms are real, substantial, and inadequately addressed through compensation alone. Yet reconciling incumbent protection with newcomer access, integration imperatives, and future housing needs remains the fundamental challenge. Occupancy theory establishes that one dimension of justice (protecting established attachments) but does not resolve how to weigh this against competing dimensions (enabling access, promoting integration, serving future needs). The economic realities of agglomeration and spatial lock-in, to which we now turn, make these tradeoffs unavoidable and urgent.
## Section 5: The Economics of Located Goods: Agglomeration, Lock-in, and Spatial Injustice

### Agglomeration Economics: Why Location is Not Fungible

Urban economics provides the empirical foundation demonstrating that location-specific value is real, substantial, and irreducible. Agglomeration economies—productivity gains from geographic concentration—operate through three fundamental mechanisms (Duranton and Puga 2004). First, sharing: cities enable sharing of indivisible facilities, gains from variety in suppliers and services, and risk pooling in labor markets. Second, matching: thick urban labor markets improve match quality between workers and jobs, and accelerate the matching process through greater numbers of potential partners. Third, learning: dense urban environments facilitate knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face contact that cannot be replicated through telecommunications.

The empirical magnitudes establish that these mechanisms create first-order economic effects. Combes and Gobillon's (2015) comprehensive synthesis, using sophisticated identification strategies to address worker sorting and reverse causality, finds that doubling city population increases wages by 2-5% after controlling for selection effects. These agglomeration benefits are highly localized: Rosenthal and Strange (2004) document that productivity gains decay rapidly with distance, concentrated within 1-5 miles rather than spreading across entire metropolitan areas. The effects are stronger for high-skilled workers and knowledge-intensive industries, but Moretti (2011) demonstrates that low-skilled workers also benefit substantially from proximity to high-skilled workers through local multiplier effects—each high-tech job creates approximately five additional local service jobs, spreading productivity gains broadly within cities.

The distribution of these gains is profoundly unequal. Albouy and Shin's (2018) measurement of metropolitan land values reveals extraordinary concentration: five metro areas (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston) hold 48% of all US urban land value despite representing much smaller shares of population or GDP. Total urban land values exceed twice national GDP, reflecting both productivity differences and quality-of-life amenities. Crucially, Albouy (2016) demonstrates that wage and housing cost differences primarily reflect productivity rather than amenities—high housing costs in San Francisco mainly capitalize higher wages from agglomeration, not just pleasant weather. This matters normatively because productivity-based land values arguably result from positive externalities and public investment, raising questions about whether current residents can legitimately claim exclusive rights to value they did not individually create.

Moretti's (2011) general equilibrium framework reveals how housing supply elasticity determines whether agglomeration benefits manifest as population growth or price increases. In cities with elastic housing supply, demand shocks from productivity growth create building booms—more people can access opportunity-rich locations. In cities with inelastic supply, the same productivity growth generates housing price increases that prevent access, concentrating benefits among existing residents who capture gains through property appreciation rather than sharing them through population growth. This mechanism directly links housing policy to distributional justice: exclusionary regulation transforms agglomeration economies from potentially broadly-shared opportunities into private gains for incumbent property owners.

### Housing Supply Constraints and Spatial Misallocation

Geographic and regulatory constraints combine to create housing supply inelasticity in precisely the most productive cities. Saiz's (2010) analysis using satellite data to measure developable land shows that geographic features—steep slopes exceeding 15 degrees, oceans, wetlands—strongly predict supply inelasticity. The most constrained markets (San Francisco, Miami, New York) face severe natural limits. However, regulation interacts with geography: land-constrained cities tend to adopt stricter regulations, amplifying natural scarcity. Gyourko et al.'s (2008) Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index documents substantial variation in regulatory stringency across 2,000+ jurisdictions, with highly regulated communities featuring multiple approval entities, strict density controls, substantial impact fees, and permitting processes exceeding six months. Importantly, regulation is not randomly distributed—it correlates with coastal location, high home prices, educated populations, and slow historical growth, suggesting endogenous political economy dynamics.

The consequences are severe. Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) demonstrate that supply elasticity determines how urban success manifests: during the 1980s boom, the most inelastic metro areas saw 29% price growth versus only 3.4% in the most elastic markets for equivalent demand shocks. Employment responds less in supply-constrained locations: Saks (2008) finds employment growth approximately 20% lower in highly regulated places compared to unconstrained markets facing equal labor demand shocks. If all metropolitan areas were as elastic as the median, the US housing stock would be 15 million units larger (Glaeser and Gyourko 2018).

Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) landmark study quantifies the aggregate economic costs of spatial misallocation. Using a spatial equilibrium model with 220 metropolitan areas from 1964-2009, they show that housing supply constraints in just three cities—New York, San Francisco, and San Jose—reduced US GDP growth by 36% over this 45-year period. The mechanism is direct: high-productivity cities adopted stringent zoning and land use regulations limiting housing supply, which raised housing costs and prevented workers from migrating to where they would be more productive. Lowering constraints in these three cities to the median would increase GDP by 8.9%. This is not a marginal efficiency loss but a first-order drag on national economic growth and individual opportunity. Workers who would thrive in productive urban environments cannot access them due to exclusionary housing policies.

Gyourko and Molloy's (2015) comprehensive review establishes that regulation's political economy primarily reflects homeowner interests protecting property values—the "homevoter hypothesis" (Fischel 2001). Homeowners dominate local government because, unlike diversified corporate shareholders, they hold most wealth in single illiquid assets making them intensely focused on local policies affecting home values. They rationally support restrictive zoning that raises property values by limiting supply, even though this imposes substantial costs on would-be residents and aggregate welfare. Once enacted, regulation tends to persist and strengthen—a ratchet effect where restrictions become institutionally entrenched. The regulatory frontier is closing: even sunbelt cities historically known for elastic supply are now adopting restrictive regulations, potentially worsening affordability nationwide.

### Path Dependency and Spatial Lock-In

Past decisions create persistent spatial configurations that constrain present justice even when those decisions were not themselves unjust. Baum-Snow's (2007) analysis using planned 1947 Interstate Highway routes as exogenous variation demonstrates that each highway ray passing through a central city reduced its population by approximately 18%. The Interstate System enabled suburbanization by reducing commuting costs, and this suburban development pattern persists today despite changing preferences for urban living. The infrastructure cannot easily be removed, suburban investments are sunk, and spatial lock-in makes reversing these patterns extraordinarily difficult and expensive.

Regulatory path dependency compounds infrastructure lock-in. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) document that regulation, once adopted, rarely relaxes and often strengthens. High-income coastal states that adopted strict land use controls in the 1970s-80s have maintained and expanded those regulations. This creates temporal injustice: current generations inherit regulatory frameworks enacted before they could vote, limiting their housing options in productive cities.

Ganong and Shoag's (2017) analysis reveals the distributional consequences of spatial lock-in. US states experienced steady income convergence from 1880-1980 at approximately 1.8% annually as workers migrated from low-wage to high-wage states. This century-long convergence stopped after 1980. The mechanism: land-use restrictions in high-income states raised housing costs, creating barriers preventing low-skilled workers from migrating to opportunity while high-skilled workers could still afford to move. Migration from low-wage to high-wage states drove 40-75% of historical convergence, but after 1980, high housing costs make this mobility worthwhile only for high-earners. Attorneys can afford to move to expensive coastal cities where housing consumes 21% of income, but janitors cannot when rent would consume 52% of earnings. This asymmetry means housing costs now prevent precisely those workers who would benefit most from accessing high-wage regions, exacerbating rather than reducing inequality.

Autor et al.'s (2013) analysis of Chinese import competition's local labor market effects demonstrates spatial lock-in's persistence. Manufacturing job losses from trade created large persistent effects on unemployment, labor force participation, and wages in exposed commuting zones. Transfer payments (unemployment insurance, disability, retirement benefits, healthcare assistance) rose sharply in trade-exposed areas, indicating that adjustment costs are substantial and long-lasting. Workers in declining regions face barriers relocating to growing areas—partly due to housing costs in growing cities (Ganong and Shoag 2017), partly due to place attachment and community ties. They are trapped between disappearing opportunities in manufacturing regions and inaccessible opportunities in expensive coastal cities.

### Gentrification, Sorting, and Displacement Evidence

Couture et al.'s (2019) analysis of income-based spatial sorting shows how rising incomes manifest geographically. A 10% metropolitan income increase associates with a 13% increase in affluent households living in downtown areas. Rising incomes of the rich explain approximately 50% of the "rich urbanization" and "poor suburbanization" patterns observed since 1980. Poor households either face displacement or pay higher rents for amenities they value less than wealthier incoming residents value them. Income inequality drives spatial sorting with distributional consequences concentrated on lower-income households.

The empirical evidence on gentrification-induced displacement is more nuanced than simple narratives suggest. Ellen and O'Regan (2011), tracking individual homeowners through 1990s neighborhood change using confidential Census data, find no heightened displacement of original residents, even among the most vulnerable. Income gains came from higher-income in-migration, selective exit of lower-income residents, and income gains by original residents. Importantly, original residents reported greater neighborhood satisfaction improvements than those in persistently low-income areas. Dragan et al. (2020), using longitudinal NYC Medicaid records tracking low-income children from 2009-2015, similarly find no evidence that gentrification meaningfully increases mobility rates, though moves that do occur tend to be longer-distance. Children starting in gentrifying areas experience larger residential environment improvements (lower poverty rates, better schools) than counterparts in persistently low-SES areas.

However, these findings require careful interpretation. Both studies focus on either homeowners (Ellen and O'Regan) or very low-income Medicaid-eligible families (Dragan et al.), potentially missing displacement of working-class renters who are neither homeowners nor poor enough for Medicaid. The time periods (1990s, 2009-2015) and location (NYC with rent regulation) may not generalize to more recent gentrification waves in less-regulated markets. Methodological challenges persist: tracking people who leave neighborhoods is inherently difficult, potentially biasing against finding displacement. Aggregate neighborhood improvements do not address whether benefits are fairly distributed or whether more egalitarian improvements were possible. The critical gentrification studies tradition (Lees et al. 2008, Slater 2006) argues that displacement research has been marginalized as attention shifted to gentrification's benefits, creating an "eviction of critical perspectives" that mirrors the physical eviction of low-income residents.

### Normative Implications

The economic evidence establishes three crucial points for normative theory. First, location-specific value is real and enormous. Agglomeration effects create productivity gains of 2-5% from doubling city size, concentrated urban land values exceed $2 trillion, and wage premiums in productive cities reach 10-30%. This is not speculation or noise but fundamental economic reality making location non-fungible. Second, this value is largely socially created rather than individually produced. Agglomeration arises from positive externalities of density, public infrastructure investment, and thick labor markets—not from individual landowners' efforts. This raises questions about who legitimately claims these gains. Third, current allocation mechanisms—housing markets operating under exclusionary regulation—prevent efficient access and entrench inequality. Housing constraints reduced US GDP growth by 36% while halting regional income convergence and blocking low-income mobility to opportunity.

These findings transform the normative landscape for housing justice. Exclusionary housing policies are not merely redistributive (transferring opportunity from newcomers to incumbents) but destructive (preventing value creation and aggregate opportunity). The efficiency losses (36% GDP reduction) suggest these policies are not Pareto-optimal local control but welfare-destroying exclusion. The distributional pattern (blocking low-skilled workers while accommodating high-skilled) exacerbates inequality rather than simply reflecting market outcomes. The path dependency (regulations from decades ago constraining current mobility) creates temporal injustice where present generations inherit spatial configurations limiting their choices. How housing justice philosophy engages with these empirical realities is the subject of the next section.
## Section 6: Housing Justice and the Gentrification Debate

### Right to Housing Frameworks

Philosophical work on housing justice has developed multiple frameworks for why housing deserves special protection beyond ordinary market goods. Waldron's (1991) foundational analysis establishes homelessness as a freedom problem rather than merely resource deficit. Everything that is done must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform an action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. Homeless people lack freedom because they have no space under exclusive control where basic life activities can be performed without permission. Private property and restrictive public space rules combine to make exercise of basic freedoms effectively impossible for those without housing. Essert (2016) develops this insight, arguing that homelessness should be understood as lack of property rights—specifically, lack of any territorial security. The solution requires conferring property rights, not just providing shelter, because property rights uniquely solve the domination and dependence problem by creating a sphere of exclusive control.

Wells's (2016, 2019) Rawlsian framework proposes limited property rights for housing that look more like lease rights than full ownership. Basic justice requires "lease rights" over self-contained living space for minimum three years duration. The right includes living alone (not forced into communal housing) when resources permit. This is more limited than traditional ownership—lacking perpetual duration and alienation rights—but provides the security necessary for life planning. The three-year temporal threshold ensures sufficient stability while remaining more realistic than claims to indefinite ownership. Wells's proposal demonstrates how property theory can ground housing security without requiring full ownership, particularly relevant for tenant protections in rental markets where most urban low-income residents live.

Radin's (1982) personhood theory provides philosophical foundation for why homes deserve stronger property protections than fungible goods. Certain property is "personal"—bound up with identity and self-development—deserving more robust legal protection than "fungible" property held purely instrumentally. Homes are paradigmatic personal property because of their constitutive role in self-development, relationships, and life projects. Long-term residence makes housing personal property meriting enhanced protection against dispossession. This framework supports tenant protections grounded not in welfare or efficiency but in property's relationship to personhood.

Dummer and Neuhäuser's (2025) refined capabilities approach addresses limitations in Nussbaum's sufficientarian framework. Housing has positional and relational dimensions beyond absolute quality thresholds. Segregation by income or race affects capabilities even when housing meets minimum standards because self-respect depends on comparative status and social bases of recognition. Concentrated poverty undermines capabilities through peer effects, reduced access to opportunity networks, and stigmatization, regardless of individual housing unit quality. This relational turn in capabilities theory connects to Anderson's (1999) democratic equality framework, suggesting housing justice requires not just minimum provision but attention to how residential patterns enable or undermine equal social relations.

### Structural Injustice Frameworks

Young's (2011) social connection model shifts focus from individual rights to systemic patterns. Her paradigmatic case is Sandy, a single mother facing homelessness when her building converts to condominiums. Sandy's homelessness results from many actors' actions constituting housing markets and policy contexts, with none doing anything particularly reprehensible individually. Structural injustice exists when social processes systematically threaten groups with domination or deprivation while enabling others' expanded opportunities. All who contribute to structural processes producing injustice have political responsibility to remedy it—responsibility that is collective, forward-looking, and focused on changing structures rather than assigning individual blame.

Shelby's (2016) analysis of "dark ghettos" applies Rawlsian justice principles to spatial structures. Racially segregated, economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods constitute symptoms of systemic injustice in America's basic structure, not cultural pathologies or mere unfortunate outcomes. Segregated ghettos violate reciprocity (mutual benefit from social cooperation), fair equality of opportunity (equal prospects for those with equal talents and motivation), and civic equality (relating as political equals). The injustice lies in basic institutional structures—discrimination in labor and housing markets, segregated education, wealth inequality—not in ghetto residents themselves. Shelby's framework treats spatial arrangements as fundamental components of society's basic structure subject to justice principles, requiring systemic reform rather than targeted neighborhood interventions.

Anderson's (2010) integration imperative establishes residential segregation as the fundamental cause of persistent African American disadvantage across virtually all well-being dimensions. Integration is both moral and democratic imperative because segregation perpetuates inequality in education, employment, wealth accumulation, health, and political power through multiple interlocking mechanisms. This creates profound tension with community protection arguments: achieving integration may require overriding incumbent preferences, disrupting established communities, and enabling neighborhood demographic change that longtime residents resist. Anderson's empirical case for integration's importance is compelling, but it conflicts directly with occupancy rights frameworks emphasizing incumbent protection.

### Political Economy Critiques

Harvey's (2008) Marxist "right to the city" fundamentally challenges liberal rights frameworks. Urbanization under capitalism systematically extracts surplus from working classes while control over urban development lies with capital and property speculators. The right to the city is not merely access to urban resources but an "active right to make the city different"—a collective right to reshape urbanization processes democratically according to human needs rather than profit imperatives. Gentrification represents class dispossession, extracting value from working-class neighborhoods while displacing residents to serve capital accumulation. Liberal rights approaches, Harvey argues, treat symptoms (unequal housing access) without addressing causes (commodification, property relations, capitalism itself).

Madden and Marcuse's (2016) analysis frames housing crisis as rooted in commodification and financialization, not policy failures. "Hypercommodification" makes luxury real estate and displacement two sides of the same process—both serve financial speculation and capital accumulation. Housing crisis is a feature of financialized capitalism, not a bug fixable through policy tweaks. Decommodification—removing housing from market logic—is required, not just affordability programs that leave market mechanisms intact. Aalbers (2016) extends this analysis, showing how financialization represents structural transformation where housing becomes "High-Quality Collateral" for global capital. States actively create conditions for financial actors to dominate housing provision through "regulated deregulation," restructuring to favor finance over residents. Dancygier and Saunders (2025) provide empirical evidence that publics recognize this: Germans experiencing housing financialization express fundamental rejection of treating housing as speculative asset, viewing it instead as social right and holding states responsible for provision.

Erck's (2024) limitarian approach applies Robeyns's framework to housing: it is morally wrong to have too much housing while others lack enough. Multiple-property ownership by individuals and corporations contributes to housing scarcity and unaffordability. Housing wealth ceilings would complement lower-bound rights to housing, constraining excessive accumulation. This approach addresses housing justice from the upper bound—limiting hoarding—rather than only ensuring minimum provision, connecting to financialization critiques of housing as speculative asset.

### Gentrification's Multidimensional Wrongfulness

Recent work identifies multiple dimensions of gentrification's harm beyond simple displacement. Physical displacement—forced relocation of residents—is the most obvious harm. Krishnamurthy and Moore (2024) show how gentrification violates three place-based rights simultaneously: rights to a home (secure shelter), rights of residency (stable political membership), and place-based rights to community (valued relationships tied to place). This pluralistic account explains why displacement harms even when residents receive compensation—the three rights cannot be satisfied by money or equivalent housing elsewhere.

Lopez-Cantero's (2025) phenomenological displacement concept captures non-material harms affecting residents who remain physically but experience erosion of belonging and at-homeness. Symbolic displacement occurs when neighborhood transformation—familiar places closing, social networks dissolving, cultural markers disappearing—destroys the social world residents valued even without forcing them to move. These experiential losses constitute injustice inadequately addressed through compensation or even anti-displacement policies that keep residents in place physically while their neighborhood transforms around them.

Draper's (2024) democratic theory critique identifies gentrification's political harms: undermining everyday democratic communication. Gentrification damages democracy through two mechanisms. Community disintegration in low-income enclaves eliminates social networks and shared spaces for informal political discussion among longtime residents. Homogenization in mixed-income areas reduces diversity of perspectives and limits informal public sphere access as economic and cultural change favors affluent newcomers' preferences. Democratic harm occurs even without physical displacement—gentrification damages the informal political culture and deliberative capacity essential to democratic citizenship.

Lloyd's (2023) Lockean argument grounds incumbent claims in collective labor creating community goods. Long-term residents have labored together to create valuable community objects—social networks, cultural institutions, mutual aid relationships, neighborhood practices. Gentrification appropriates these collectively-created goods for newcomers' benefit without compensating creators. Extending Walzer's spheres of justice, Lloyd argues community goods constitute a separate sphere deserving protection from market dominance. This collective creation framework provides grounds for incumbent claims beyond individual autonomy or property, emphasizing shared investment over time.

### The Integration-Community Stability Tension

The deepest unresolved tension in housing justice literature concerns reconciling integration imperatives with community protection. Anderson's (2010) integration priority argues that segregation perpetuates inequality across all dimensions—education, employment, wealth, health, political power. Residential integration is morally and democratically necessary even when it requires overriding incumbent preferences that maintain segregation. Breaking down segregated patterns justifies policies enabling neighborhood demographic change including gentrification that brings mixed-income residents into formerly low-income areas.

Place-protection theorists (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018, Lloyd 2023, Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) emphasize that occupancy rights, community goods, and located life plans deserve protection from displacement. Gentrification wrongs incumbent residents by disrupting place-based attachments and community relationships built over time. However, strong incumbent protection risks entrenching segregation when protected communities are racially or economically homogeneous. If residents have rights to preserve neighborhood character and resist demographic change, how can integration occur?

Kogelmann's (2025) analysis reveals that autonomy arguments generate this tension. Anti-gentrification advocates cite displacement's autonomy violations—forced relocation disrupts residents' capacity to pursue chosen life plans. Pro-zoning advocates cite homeowners' autonomy to control their property and neighborhood character—exclusionary zoning protects residents' choices about community composition. The same normative principle (autonomy) yields opposed policy conclusions (anti-displacement protection vs. exclusionary zoning), suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate the incumbent-newcomer conflict. This reveals a fundamental theoretical gap: we lack principles for determining when incumbent autonomy interests override access rights and vice versa.

### Empirical Complexity and Normative Assessment

The empirical evidence on displacement reviewed in Section 5 complicates normative assessment. If original low-income residents often remain in gentrifying neighborhoods and report improved satisfaction (Ellen and O'Regan 2011, Dragan et al. 2020), does this vindicate gentrification against displacement critiques? The answer is complex. First, even if many residents benefit from remaining, those who are displaced still suffer wrongful harm—aggregate improvements don't justify individual injustices. Second, non-displacement harms (phenomenological displacement, democratic damage, community dissolution) persist even when residents remain physically. Third, empirical studies may miss displacement of working-class renters, focusing on very low-income (Medicaid) or homeowners while the middle is squeezed out. Fourth, normative assessment cannot reduce to preference satisfaction—residents might adapt preferences to limited options (adaptive preferences problem), or improvements might be unequally distributed within staying populations.

The housing justice literature reveals rich normative frameworks but persistent theoretical gaps. Multiple dimensions of injustice (distributive, recognitional, procedural, relational, structural) apply to housing simultaneously, yet we lack principles for integrating them. Temporal claims create especially difficult tradeoffs: incumbent occupancy versus newcomer access, historical claims versus current needs, community stability versus integration imperatives. Different frameworks (rights-based, capabilities, structural injustice, political economy) identify different problems and generate different solutions. What research gaps remain, and how might they be addressed? Section 7 synthesizes these into a forward-looking research agenda.
## Section 7: Research Gaps and Future Directions

This review has surveyed diverse theoretical frameworks—distributive justice, temporal justice, occupancy rights, property theory, urban economics, and housing justice—addressing temporal claims to located goods. Despite rich interdisciplinary literature, significant gaps remain that future research must address to develop adequate normative frameworks for housing allocation, gentrification ethics, and spatial justice.

### Gap 1: Operationalizing Temporal Thresholds for Occupancy Rights

Occupancy theory establishes that temporal residence generates moral claims, but provides insufficient guidance on when and how these rights accrue. Stilz (2009, 2013, 2019) argues occupancy rights establish through "residence and participation in ongoing practices" but does not specify duration thresholds. Wells (2019) proposes minimum three years for lease-like rights, but is this sufficient for the deep place attachment occupancy theory emphasizes, or too long for mobile populations who may need protection sooner? No systematic account exists of how rights accumulate incrementally over time.

**Research needed**: Develop a graded account of occupancy rights accumulation specifying thresholds for different types of claims. Perhaps basic security rights (protection from arbitrary eviction) emerge quickly (months), residency rights (participation in local governance) at intermediate durations (1-2 years), and full anti-displacement rights (protection from gentrification-induced removal) after extended occupancy (3+ years). Integration with psychological research on place attachment formation could provide empirical grounding. Cross-cultural variation in mobility norms and housing tenure patterns should inform whether universal thresholds are appropriate or context-dependent criteria required. This operationalization is essential for translating philosophical theory into concrete policy guidance.

### Gap 2: Reconciling Incumbent Protection with Newcomer Access

The theoretical stalemate between incumbent protection and newcomer access represents the deepest unresolved tension. Occupancy rights theorists (Stilz, Moore, Krishnamurthy and Moore) emphasize claims of established residents based on temporal attachment and place-based life plans. Integration advocates (Anderson 2010) and cosmopolitans prioritize access to opportunity-rich locations and breaking down unjust segregation. Kogelmann (2025) demonstrates that autonomy arguments yield opposed conclusions, suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate this conflict. No principled framework exists for determining when incumbent claims override access rights and vice versa.

**Research needed**: Develop priority rules specifying conditions under which incumbents' temporal claims take precedence versus when newcomers' access rights prevail. Apply Meyer and Waligore's (2022) supersession framework to identify what "changed circumstances" supersede versus preserve incumbent claims in housing contexts. Address whether there is normatively-significant asymmetry: do historically-displaced communities (those subjected to redlining, urban renewal) have stronger anti-gentrification claims than recent exclusionary suburbs? When does protecting established communities entrench unjust segregation requiring override? This requires integrating historical injustice theory, occupancy rights, and equal opportunity principles into unified framework addressing temporal priority systematically.

### Gap 3: Distributing Agglomeration Rents and Socially-Created Location Value

Urban economics establishes that city land values are largely socially created rather than individually produced. Albouy and Shin (2018) document over $2 trillion in concentrated urban land value. Moretti (2011) shows agglomeration creates 5x multiplier effects distributing productivity broadly through local economies. Combes and Gobillon (2015) confirm that density generates 2-5% productivity gains through sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms requiring social interaction and public infrastructure. Yet this socially-created value is captured by property owners through land appreciation rather than shared with workers who generate it or the public that invested in enabling infrastructure.

**Research needed**: Develop normative framework for distributing socially-created location value. Who deserves to capture agglomeration rents: current residents (rewarding priority), all residents (recognizing collective creation), national population (given public infrastructure investment and equal opportunity principles), or future generations (intergenerational trust)? How does temporal occupancy interact with value creation—do long-term residents have stronger claims than recent arrivals, or does value's social creation undermine occupancy-based appropriation? Consider mechanisms like land value taxation, community land trusts, and benefit-sharing arrangements. Connect to supersession debate: does past occupancy ground claims to future appreciation even when that appreciation results from socially-created agglomeration rather than individual effort?

### Gap 4: Temporal Justice and Path Dependency Obligations

Path dependency creates structural constraints without clear historical injustice, raising distinct normative questions. Baum-Snow (2007) shows that 1950s-70s highway routes reduced central city populations by 18% per ray, creating suburban development persisting today. Ganong and Shoag (2017) demonstrate that regulations enacted decades ago halted regional income convergence by preventing current low-income workers from accessing opportunity. Fischel's (2001) homevoter dynamics create self-reinforcing exclusion as homeowners protecting property values perpetuate restrictive zoning across generations.

**Research needed**: Develop framework for "structural historical obligations" distinct from direct wrongdoing-based rectification. When do inherited spatial configurations create duties even absent historical injustice claims? The current generation didn't enact exclusionary zoning or build Interstate highways, yet these decisions constrain their opportunities—does this generate obligations to reform inherited constraints? How does this relate to supersession: if past decisions weren't unjust initially but create cumulative disadvantage over time, when do obligations arise? Distinguish path dependency from historical injustice, specify when structural lock-in requires remedy, and address the intergenerational justice dimension of inheriting spatial constraints.

### Gap 5: Renters' Property Rights and Temporal Rights Accumulation

Property theory largely focuses on ownership while rental housing remains under-theorized despite renters constituting majorities in many urban areas. Honoré's (1961) bundle-of-rights shows property is disaggregatable, and Wells (2016, 2019) proposes lease-like rights for housing, but limited work develops how temporal occupancy might confer incremental property rights on renters beyond basic tenancy.

**Research needed**: Develop systematic account of how temporal rental occupancy creates accumulating property rights. Consider adverse possession as model—use over time can create ownership even absent formal title. Harding's (2019) Lockean spoilage proviso justification for squatting suggests productive use can trump formal title; does this logic extend to long-term renters? Specify which Honoré incidents (possession, use, management, income, security, residuary character) temporal renters might acquire: after 5 years' occupancy, do renters gain rights to manage property modifications, security against no-cause eviction, or even eventual ownership paths? Practical implications include tenant protections, rent control justification, right-to-purchase programs, and community land trusts. This normative theory should guide institutional design for rental housing justice.

### Gap 6: Scale and Subsidiarity in Housing Governance

Appropriate governmental level for housing decisions remains contested. Fischel (2001) shows local control produces exclusion via homevoter dynamics. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) demonstrate that local restrictions create 36% national GDP loss, suggesting externalities requiring higher-level intervention. Nine's (2025) foundational territories concept envisions overlapping, nested jurisdictions. Yet community self-determination and occupancy suggest local control legitimacy.

**Research needed**: Develop normative framework specifying which housing decisions belong at which governmental levels. Distinguish building standards (appropriately local?), inclusionary zoning requirements (regional?), fair housing enforcement (national?), and climate migration accommodation (international?). Consider overlapping jurisdictional authority (Nine's model) versus hierarchical override. Apply subsidiarity principles: presumption for local control unless clear externalities or rights violations require higher-level intervention, but what counts as sufficient externality? The 36% GDP loss from three cities' housing restrictions seems clearly sufficient, but where are thresholds? Use federalism empirics combined with normative political philosophy to develop principles balancing local self-determination against broader obligations.

### Gap 7: Supersession Criteria for Urban Neighborhood Change

Meyer and Waligore (2022) sophisticate supersession debate by distinguishing partial versus full supersession and dormant versus final supersession, but don't specify criteria for housing contexts. What counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances" when neighborhoods gentrify? Does gentrification partially supersede incumbent claims (weakening without eliminating them) or potentially fully (in extreme transformation)? Is supersession dormant (claims reassert if conditions change) or final?

**Research needed**: Apply Meyer and Waligore framework specifically to urban change, gentrification, and housing. Develop criteria distinguishing legitimate neighborhood evolution from wrongful displacement: population growth, economic development, infrastructure improvement, demographic shifts—which constitute superseding circumstances versus which create new injustices? Consider asymmetry: displacement from historically oppressed communities might resist supersession differently than displacement from exclusionary suburbs benefiting from past discrimination. Temporal dimensions: does supersession clock start immediately upon change or only after sufficient consolidation? Test criteria through case studies of specific gentrification instances to refine principles through reflective equilibrium between theory and intuitions.

### Gap 8: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Urban Research

Limited dialogue exists between philosophy and urban economics/geography despite obvious synergies. Philosophers often lack empirical grounding regarding magnitudes, mechanisms, and causal relationships. Economists rarely engage normative questions about fairness, desert, and just distribution. Notable exceptions like Hsieh and Moretti (2019) provide empirical foundations that could inform normative debates, but such integration remains rare.

**Research needed**: Foster collaborations between philosophers and urban economists/geographers. Empirically test normative intuitions: do temporal thresholds for occupancy rights track psychological place attachment patterns? Do communities' expressed preferences about displacement reflect the values occupancy theory attributes to place-based life plans? Philosophical analysis of economic findings: how should agglomeration rents be distributed? Is spatial misallocation unjust beyond inefficiency? What fairness principles should govern who captures land value appreciation? Housing provides paradigmatic case for empirically-informed normative theory—location value is quantifiable, displacement is measurable, temporal attachment can be studied. Exploit this potential for integrated research bridging normative political philosophy and empirical urban studies.

### Gap 9: Displacement Measurement and Normative Significance

Empirical displacement evidence is contested. Ellen and O'Regan (2011) and Dragan et al. (2020) find limited displacement with environmental improvements for stayers. Critical scholars (Lees et al. 2008, Slater 2006) argue displacement is real but methodologically difficult to measure, and that research focusing on benefits marginalizes displacement harms. Normative questions remain unresolved: if original residents benefit from gentrification on average, does this make it just? Or do non-displacement harms, distributional asymmetries within staying populations, and rights violations against displaced minorities create injustice regardless of aggregate welfare gains?

**Research needed**: Clarify relationship between empirical displacement findings and normative assessment. Specify what empirical evidence would and would not settle normative questions. If residents rarely move but experience phenomenological displacement (Lopez-Cantero 2025), is this sufficient harm? If aggregate neighborhood quality improves but benefits are unequally distributed (affluent newcomers capture most gains), does this constitute injustice? Develop metrics for gentrification benefit/burden distribution beyond simple displacement rates: who gains how much, who loses what, how are non-material losses (community dissolution, democratic damage) weighted against material improvements? Address methodological challenges in displacement measurement to improve empirical foundation for normative theorizing.

### Gap 10: Climate Migration and Housing Justice Integration

Climate change creates urgent new dimensions for temporal housing claims. Stilz (2024) applies occupancy theory to climate displacement, arguing territorial justice requires prioritizing in situ adaptation enabling people to remain. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing costs already prevent mobility to opportunity. Climate refugees will need housing in productive, safe cities where current residents resist demographic change and housing costs exclude low-income migrants.

**Research needed**: Integrate climate justice with housing justice literature systematically. Apply temporal justice frameworks (supersession, occupancy, property) to climate displacement: do climate refugees' urgent needs supersede incumbent residents' occupancy claims? Or do both have legitimate competing claims requiring accommodation? How do future climate impacts affect present housing allocation—should cities expected to become climate refuges face special obligations to expand housing capacity now? Intergenerational dimension: current generation's housing exclusion prevents future generation's climate adaptation. Consider mechanism design: how can housing policy accommodate climate migration while respecting place-based claims? What obligations do productive coastal cities have to climate-displaced populations? This integration is urgently needed as climate migration accelerates.

### Synthesis and Priorities

These ten gaps represent substantial opportunities for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical housing policy. They cluster around four priority themes. First, **operationalizing temporal dimensions** (Gaps 1, 5): translating philosophical concepts of occupancy and rights accumulation into concrete thresholds and institutional designs that can guide policy. Second, **reconciling competing temporal claims** (Gaps 2, 7): developing priority rules for when incumbent attachment overrides access rights versus when equal opportunity or integration imperatives prevail. Third, **empirically-informed normative theory** (Gaps 3, 8, 9): integrating urban economics and geography with philosophical analysis to develop theories responsive to actual magnitudes, mechanisms, and empirical realities. Fourth, **climate integration** (Gap 10): addressing how climate displacement transforms housing justice debates with added urgency.

Addressing these gaps requires genuinely interdisciplinary collaboration. Philosophers must engage empirical urban research to ground normative theorizing in economic and social realities. Economists and geographers must take normative questions seriously rather than assuming efficiency or preference-satisfaction resolve distributive conflicts. Policy researchers and urban planners need philosophical frameworks for thinking through temporal tradeoffs and competing claims beyond political feasibility. Climate scientists and migration scholars should inform housing justice debates about future pressures and constraints.

The stakes are substantial. Housing policy affects not just current distribution but intergenerational opportunity, regional economic development, climate adaptation capacity, and the fundamental question of who can live where. Temporal claims to located goods—incumbents versus newcomers, past versus present versus future, historical injustice versus changed circumstances—structure these debates at every level. Developing adequate normative frameworks for adjudicating these temporal tensions is among the most important tasks for political philosophy, with direct implications for millions facing housing precarity, displacement, or exclusion from opportunity-rich locations. The theoretical resources reviewed here provide foundations, but substantial work remains to build on these foundations toward integrated, empirically-grounded, practically-relevant theories of temporal justice for housing in a non-fungible, path-dependent, rapidly changing spatial economy.
