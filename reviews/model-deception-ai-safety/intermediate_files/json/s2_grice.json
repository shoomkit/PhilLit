Strictly speaking, we, you and I communicate with one another in our day-to-day life and simply understand each other. Paul Grice\u2019s has presented his cooperative principle theory to explain our day-to-day life conversation. This article aims to review the basic Grecian theory of conversational implicature, identifying important consequences, known problems, and useful extensions or modifications. This paper is about how people should consider meeting the cooperative principle in order to perform successfully in communication which is based mainly on Paul Grice\u2019s theory of implicature which is considered one of the most important contributions to pragmatics.

In order to have a good communication, people must obey the maxims. Maxim is a principle proposed by the philosopher Paul Grice whereby those involved in communication assume that both parties will normally seek to cooperate with each other to establish agreed meaning. The aim of this study is to find out the infringement maxim in the story of The Adventure of Tintin and to know the impact of infringement maxim in communication purposes. In obtaining the data, the researcher used descriptive qualitative to find out the out the infringement maxims among the caharcters. The object of this study is the dialogue among the characters of The Adventure of Tintin which infringe Grice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maxim. The results of this research are the most of the characters in the dialogue infringe the maxim of quality in order to entertain the readers. The researcher found out 30 data for the infringement of Qualitative maxim, 27 data for the infringement of Quantitative maxim, 19 data for the infringement of maxim of Manner, and 29 data for the infringement of maxim of Relevance.",

The cooperative principle makes several requirements of speakers (see Figure 1). They must avoid providing less or more information than is required (first and second maxims of quantity), be truthful and avoid saying something lacking adequate evidence (maxim of quality), be relevant to the topic of conversation (maxim of relation), and avoid obscurity of expression and ambiguity and be brief and orderly (maxim of manner). An additional maxim of politeness (be polite) has also be added to the four maxims proposed by Grice.",

      "abstract": "Apart from a passing reference to Kant, Grice never explains in his writings how he came to discover his conversational maxims. He simply proclaims them without justification. Yet regardless of how his ingenious invention really came about, one might wonder how the conversational maxims can be detected and distinguished from other sorts of maxims. We argue that the conversational maxims can be identified by the use of a transcendental argument in the spirit of Kant. To this end, we introduce Grice\u2019s account of conversational maxims and categories and compare it briefly with Kant\u2019s thoughts on categories. Subsequently, we pursue a thought experiment concerning what would happen if speakers constantly broke one or another of the maxims. It seems that it would not be possible for children to recognize a significant number of lexical meanings under such circumstances. Hence, the conversational maxims are rules whose occasional application is a necessary condition of language and conversation.",

      "abstract": "As humans communicate, much of what goes on is not simply about conveying information to themselves. In Grice\u2019s paper \u201cLogic and Conversation (1975)\u201d, he argued that some cooperative principle is assumed to be in operation for a person to interpret what someone else says. In a typical conversational flow, the speaker needs to adhere to a pattern in order to be informative, truthful and clear and there exist a set of principles that direct the hearer to a particular interpretation of what is said.\u00a0 This is because a speaker can mean something either by saying it or by saying (or \u2018making as if to say\u2019) something else. What is implicated by saying something is generally not what is said. This paper attempted to critically review how speakers manage to convey more than what is said and how the hearer arrives at the speaker meaning using a descriptive qualitative approach. This paper employs a descriptive qualitative approach. The key findings of the study is described in two context: first of all, speakers intentionally obey the maxims in conversation which in essence affirms Grice\u2019s theory of cooperative principle in fulfilment of at least some of the maxims. Second, speakers exploit the maxims either deliberately or fail to observe by deciding to violate, suspend, flout, infringe, or opt-out of a conversation. This situation is one premised to give rise to conversational implicatures. A competent hearer should be able to arrive at these possible conclusions in order to draw out the speaker meaning from what was merely said.",

On this basis, the author intends to address the breaches of Grice's maxims in one selected film and to investigate the intent of the infringements in \u201cthe Prince and the Pauper\u201d conversational discourse. Many sections of the film contain violations of Grice's maxim characters. The writer formulates two work problems in order to achieve these goals: Which of Grice's maxims was violated in The Prince and the Pauper movie by the addressees?; For what reasons are the maxims infringed by the addresses?. Based on the analysis, the author argues that the characters, in particular Duke, Tom Canty, King, and the Earl of Hertford, have violated Grice's four maxims in the film dialogue. If they fail to provide sufficient information, tell their addressees to lie, provide irrelevant glosses, and fail to be real, concise, univocal, and orderly, they violate the Quantity, Value, Relevance, and Manner maxims, respectively. In reality, the writer believes that characters are breaching the maxims to trick colleagues, to be sweet, to save face, to avoid discussion, and to show self-interest.",

We claim that many of the observed shortcomings can be attributed to violation of one or more conversational principles. By drawing upon extensive research from both the social science and AI communities, we propose a set of maxims -- quantity, quality, relevance, manner, benevolence, and transparency -- for describing effective human-AI conversation. We first justify the applicability of the first four maxims (from Grice) in the context of human-AI interactions. We then argue that two new maxims, benevolence (concerning the generation of, and engagement with, harmful content) and transparency (concerning recognition of one's knowledge boundaries, operational constraints, and intents), are necessary for addressing behavior unique to modern human-AI interactions. We evaluate the degree to which various language models are able to understand these maxims and find that models possess an internal prioritization of principles that can significantly impact their ability to interpret the maxims accurately.",

It provides a revision of both Grice\u2019s cooperative principle and the principles of truthfulness, relevance, informativeness and clarity, and extends them to include a principle of social conformity, which I collectively refer to as the TRICS-Principles. I demonstrate that the TRICS-Principles operate independently of each other at different levels and show the extent to which the other principles may function under the umbrella of a flouted principle of truthfulness. Furthermore, I distinguish the principle of social conformity from the concept of politeness, offering a nuanced perspective on their relationship. Finally, I provide new insights into factors influencing shifts in the prioritisation of the TRICS-Principles.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we argue that safety claims, when justified by a safety case, are descriptive fallible knowledge claims. Even if the aim of a safety case was to justify infallible knowledge about the safety of a system, such infallible safety knowledge is impossible to attain in the case of AI-enabled systems. By their nature AI-enabled systems preclude the possibility of obtaining infallible knowledge concerning their safety or lack thereof. We suggest that one can communicate knowledge of an AI-enabled system\u2019s safety by structuring their exchange according to Paul Grice\u2019s Cooperative Principle which can be achieved via adherence to the Gricean maxims of communication. Furthermore, these same maxims can be used to evaluate the calibre of the exchange, with the aim being to ensure that communicating knowledge about an AI-enabled system\u2019s safety is of the highest calibre, in short, that the communication is relevant, of sufficient quantity and quality, and communicated perspicuously. The high calibre communication of safety claims to an epistemically diverse group of stakeholders is vitally important given the increasingly participatory nature of AI-enabled system design, development and assessment.",

There were 15 active EZC students were taken as subject of the study. In deciding samples, purposive sampling technique was used. The samples were 4 male students and 5 female students. In the data analysis, descriptive qualitative method was used. For collecting data, there were 2 techniques used: observation and interview. After the data were collected, the recorded conversations (the length of each conversation is about 5 until 10 minutes) were sorted and translated. The result showed that the maxims violated were maxim of quantity (30 times), maxim of quality (20 times), maxim of manner (10) and maxim of relevance (5 times). The reason for violating the maxims approved to be caused by cultural factor and social distance factor. In conclusion, the maxim that dominantly being violated was maxim of quantity.",

      "abstract": "In their daily activities, people will need to interact with other people. In this interaction, people use language as a means of communication. A conversation, as a way of people doing communication, can only\u00a0take place by the presence of both speakers and hearers under a particular circumstance. As one of the pragmatic aspects, cooperative principle becomes something that should be noticed in a conversation. Grice (1975) said that the conversation will run well if both of the speaker and hearer obey the rules of conversation which he arranged into\u00a0four conversational maxims, namely Maxim of Quantity, Maxim of Quality, Maxim of Relevance, and Maxim of Manner. For Islamic followers, these conversational rules, however, have long time been known well since Islam has ruled its people to treat other people well in all aspects, not to mention in speaking. This\u00a0present article will see how Grice\u2019s conversational maxims, which were proposed in 1975, are in line with the\u00a0Islamic\u00a0conversational rules\u00a0which were mentioned in Quran and hadith long time ago, since 600s. It means that this broadly-known pragmatic theory is not something new in Islam. It is also to prove that Islam, to some extent,\u00a0\u00a0is the source of knowledge and value which are often developed further by western scholars. \n\u00a0 \nKeywords: pragmatics,\u00a0Grice\u2019s conversational maxims, Islamic conversational rules",
