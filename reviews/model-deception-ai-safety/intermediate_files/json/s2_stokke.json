      "abstract": "This book is a comprehensive study of lying and insincere language use. Part I is dedicated to developing an account of insincerity qua linguistic phenomenon. It provides a detailed theory of the distinction between lying and ways of speaking insincerely without lying, as well as accounting for the relation between lying and deceiving. A novel theory of assertion in terms of a notion of what is said defined relative to questions under discussion is used to underpin the analysis of lying and insincerity throughout the book. The framework is applied to various kinds of insincere speech, including false implicature, bullshitting, and forms of misleading with presuppositions, prosodic focus, and different types of semantic incompleteness. Part II discusses the relation between what is communicated and the speaker\u2019s attitudes involved in insincere language use. It develops a view on which insincerity is a shallow phenomenon in the sense that whether or not a speaker is being insincere depends on the speaker\u2019s conscious attitudes, rather than on deeper, unconscious attitudes or motivations. An account of a range of ways of speaking while being indifferent toward what one communicates is developed, and the phenomenon of bullshitting is distinguished from lying and other forms of insincerity. This includes insincere uses of language beyond the realm of declarative sentences. The book gives an account of insincere uses of interrogative, imperative, and exclamative utterances.",

The chapter finishes by considering the view that lies are insincere assertion in relation to the Gricean view that Quality maxims have a special status in relation to the other maxims and the Cooperative Principle.",

It distinguishes between different kinds of lying. The difference between ordinary lying and Augustinian real lying is explained. The chapters shows that while there is a sense in which ordinary liars are indifferent toward whether their assertions are true or false answers to questions under discussion, such speakers are nevertheless clearly distinguishable from bullshitters. The chapter uses these observations to argue that while lying and bullshitting are not incompatible, most lying is not bullshitting. Both the ordinary liar and the Augustinian real liar are concerned with truth-values, albeit in different ways, while the bullshitter is indifferent toward truth and falsity.",

A distinction is drawn between what is true in a fiction and the fictional record comprising what the audience has been told. The papers argues that to utter a sentence with fictional force is to intend that its content be added to a fictional record. It is shown that this view accounts for phenomena such as conversational implicatures in fictional discourse. Moreover, the view is seen to provide an attractive way of distinguishing fictional utterances from assertoric utterances. As a consequence, this account of fictional force offers a satisfactory way of distinguishing fiction from lying.",

      "abstract": "This chapter provides an overview of reactions to Harry Frankfurt\u2019s influential theory of bullshitting, addressing the four main features he ascribes to it, and considers some alternatives to Frankfurt\u2019s account. Among others, issues raised by Thomas Carson and G. A. Cohen are examined in the discussion. A proposal to characterize bullshitting in terms of Gricean maxims is discussed, and it is argued that these views fail to capture the full range of cases. Here, works by Stokke and Don Fallis are cited. An alternative view that analyzes bullshitting in terms of the speaker\u2019s attitudes toward the communal project of inquiry is canvassed, and the chapter ends by discussing the relation between bullshitting and lying.",
