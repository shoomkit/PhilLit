      "abstract": "Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring, controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines, multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow, mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations and reflections for various stakeholders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper looks at philosophical questions that arise in the context of AI alignment. It defends three propositions. First, normative and technical aspects of the AI alignment problem are interrelated, creating space for productive engagement between people working in both domains. Second, it is important to be clear about the goal of alignment. There are significant differences between AI that aligns with instructions, intentions, revealed preferences, ideal preferences, interests and values. A principle-based approach to AI alignment, which combines these elements in a systematic way, has considerable advantages in this context. Third, the central challenge for theorists is not to identify \u2018true\u2019 moral principles for AI; rather, it is to identify fair principles for alignment that receive reflective endorsement despite widespread variation in people\u2019s moral beliefs. The final part of the paper explores three ways in which fair principles for AI alignment could potentially be identified.",

While cities endure lockdowns in order to ensure decent levels of health, the challenges linked to the unfolding of the pandemic have led to the need for a radical re-think of the city, leading to the re-emergence of a concept, initially proposed in 2016 by Carlos Moreno: the \u201c15-Minute City\u201d. The concept, offering a novel perspective of \u201cchrono-urbanism\u201d, adds to existing thematic of Smart Cities and the rhetoric of building more humane urban fabrics, outlined by Christopher Alexander, and that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11 of the United Nations. With the concept gaining ground in popular media and its subsequent adoption at policy level in a number of cities of varying scale and geographies, the present paper sets forth to introduce the concept, its origins, intent and future directions.",

The introduction of AI into education marks a significant departure from conventional teaching methods, offering personalized learning and support for diverse educational requirements, including students with special needs. However, this integration presents challenges, including the need for comprehensive educator training and curriculum adaptation to align with societal structures. AI literacy is identified as crucial, encompassing an understanding of AI technologies and their broader societal impacts. Prompt engineering is highlighted as a key skill for eliciting specific responses from AI systems, thereby enriching educational experiences and promoting critical thinking. There is detailed analysis of strategies for embedding these skills within educational curricula and pedagogical practices. This is discussed through a case-study based on a Swiss university and a narrative literature review, followed by practical suggestions of how to implement AI in the classroom.",

      "abstract": "Introduction This mixed methods study examines the effects of AI-mediated language instruction on English learning achievement, L2 motivation, and self-regulated learning among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. It addresses the increasing interest in AI-driven educational technologies and their potential to revolutionize language instruction. Methods Two intact classes, consisting of a total of 60 university students, participated in this study. The experimental group received AI-mediated instruction, while the control group received traditional language instruction. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered to evaluate English learning achievement across various domains, including grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and writing skills. Additionally, self-report questionnaires were employed to assess L2 motivation and self-regulated learning. Results Quantitative analysis revealed that the experimental group achieved significantly higher English learning outcomes in all assessed areas compared to the control group. Furthermore, they exhibited greater L2 motivation and more extensive utilization of self-regulated learning strategies. These results suggest that AI-mediated instruction positively impacts English learning achievement, L2 motivation, and self-regulated learning. Discussion Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 14 students from the experimental group shed light on the transformative effects of the AI platform. It was found to enhance engagement and offer personalized learning experiences, ultimately boosting motivation and fostering self-regulated learning. These findings emphasize the potential of AI-mediated language instruction to improve language learning outcomes, motivate learners, and promote autonomy. Conclusion This study contributes to evidence-based language pedagogy, offering valuable insights to educators and researchers interested in incorporating AI-powered platforms into language classrooms. The results support the notion that AI-mediated language instruction holds promise in revolutionizing language learning, and it highlights the positive impact of AI-driven educational technologies in the realm of language education.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) recently demonstrated extraordinary capability in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including language translation, text generation, question answering, etc. Moreover, LLMs are new and essential part of computerized language processing, having the ability to understand complex verbal patterns and generate coherent and appropriate replies in a given context. Though this success of LLMs has prompted a substantial increase in research contributions, rapid growth has made it difficult to understand the overall impact of these improvements. Since a plethora of research on LLMs have been appeared within a short time, it is quite impossible to track all of these and get an overview of the current state of research in this area. Consequently, the research community would benefit from a short but thorough review of the recent changes in this area. This article thoroughly overviews LLMs, including their history, architectures, transformers, resources, training methods, applications, impacts, challenges, etc. This paper begins by discussing the fundamental concepts of LLMs with its traditional pipeline of the LLMs training phase. Then the paper provides an overview of the existing works, the history of LLMs, their evolution over time, the architecture of transformers in LLMs, the different resources of LLMs, and the different training methods that have been used to train them. The paper also demonstrates the datasets utilized in the studies. After that, the paper discusses the wide range of applications of LLMs, including biomedical and healthcare, education, social, business, and agriculture. The study also illustrates how LLMs create an impact on society and shape the future of AI and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Finally, the paper also explores open issues and challenges to deploy LLMs in real-world scenario. Our review paper aims to help practitioners, researchers, and experts thoroughly understand the evolution of LLMs, pre-trained architectures, applications, challenges, and future goals.",

By using AI technologies in smart buildings, energy consumption can be reduced through better control, improved reliability, and automation. This paper is an in-depth review of recent studies on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in smart buildings through the concept of a building management system (BMS) and demand response programs (DRPs). In addition to elaborating on the principles and applications of the AI-based modeling approaches widely used in building energy use prediction, an evaluation framework is introduced and used for assessing the recent research conducted in this field and across the major AI domains, including energy, comfort, design, and maintenance. Finally, the paper includes a discussion on the open challenges and future directions of research on the application of AI in smart buildings.",

More specifically, it summarizes advances in medical imaging acquisition technologies for different modalities, highlighting the necessity for efficient medical data management strategies in the context of AI in big healthcare data analytics. It then provides a synopsis of contemporary and emerging algorithmic methods for disease classification and organ/ tissue segmentation, focusing on AI and deep learning architectures that have already become the de facto approach. The clinical benefits of in-silico modelling advances linked with evolving 3D reconstruction and visualization applications are further documented. Concluding, integrative analytics approaches driven by associate research branches highlighted in this study promise to revolutionize imaging informatics as known today across the healthcare continuum for both radiology and digital pathology applications. The latter, is projected to enable informed, more accurate diagnosis, timely prognosis, and effective treatment planning, underpinning precision medicine.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A humanoid robot named \u2018Sophia\u2019 has sparked controversy since it has been given citizenship and has done media performances all over the world. The company that made the robot, Hanson Robotics, has touted Sophia as the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Robot scientists and philosophers have been more pessimistic about its capabilities, describing Sophia as a sophisticated puppet or chatbot. Looking behind the rhetoric about Sophia\u2019s citizenship and intelligence and going beyond recent discussions on the moral status or legal personhood of AI robots, we analyse the performativity of Sophia from the perspective of what we call \u2018political choreography\u2019: drawing on phenomenological approaches to performance-oriented philosophy of technology. This paper proposes to interpret and discuss the world tour of Sophia as a political choreography that boosts the rise of the social robot market, rather than a statement about robot citizenship or artificial intelligence. We argue that the media performances of the Sophia robot were choreographed to advance specific political interests. We illustrate our philosophical discussion with media material of the Sophia performance, which helps us to explore the mechanisms through which the media spectacle functions hand in hand with advancing the economic interests of technology industries and their governmental promotors. Using a phenomenological approach and attending to the movement of robots, we also criticize the notion of \u2018embodied intelligence\u2019 used in the context of social robotics and AI. In this way, we put the discussions about the robot\u2019s rights or citizenship in the context of AI politics and economics.",

Through the lens of the resource-based view and based on key AI capabilities such as learning, perception, prediction, interaction, adaptation, and reasoning, we explore how AI and GAI can impact 13 distinct SCOM decision-making areas. These areas include but are not limited to demand forecasting, inventory management, supply chain design, and risk management. With its outcomes, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of AI and GAI's functionality and applications in the SCOM context, offering a practical framework for both practitioners and researchers. The proposed framework systematically identifies where and how AI and GAI can be applied in SCOM, focussing on decision-making enhancement, process optimisation, investment prioritisation, and skills development. Managers can use it as a guidance to evaluate their operational processes and identify areas where AI and GAI can deliver improved efficiency, accuracy, resilience, and overall effectiveness. The research underscores that AI and GAI, with their multifaceted capabilities and applications, open a revolutionary potential and substantial implications for future SCOM practices, innovations, and research.",

      "abstract": "The paper presents an approach for implementing inscrutable (i.e., nonexplainable) artificial intelligence (AI) such as neural networks in an accountable and safe manner in organizational settings. Drawing on an exploratory case study and the recently proposed concept of envelopment, it describes a case of an organization successfully \u201cenveloping\u201d its AI solutions to balance the performance benefits of flexible AI models with the risks that inscrutable models can entail. The authors present several envelopment methods\u2014establishing clear boundaries within which the AI is to interact with its surroundings, choosing and curating the training data well, and appropriately managing input and output sources\u2014alongside their influence on the choice of AI models within the organization. This work makes two key contributions: It introduces the concept of sociotechnical envelopment by demonstrating the ways in which an organization\u2019s successful AI envelopment depends on the interaction of social and technical factors, thus extending the literature\u2019s focus beyond mere technical issues. Secondly, the empirical examples illustrate how operationalizing a sociotechnical envelopment enables an organization to manage the trade-off between low explainability and high performance presented by inscrutable models. These contributions pave the way for more responsible, accountable AI implementations in organizations, whereby humans can gain better control of even inscrutable machine-learning models.",

      "abstract": "The article examines four models of data governance emerging in the current platform society. While major attention is currently given to the dominant model of corporate platforms collecting and economically exploiting massive amounts of personal data, other actors, such as small businesses, public bodies and civic society, take also part in data governance. The article sheds light on four models emerging from the practices of these actors: data sharing pools, data cooperatives, public data trusts and personal data sovereignty. We propose a social science-informed conceptualisation of data governance. Drawing from the notion of data infrastructure we identify the models as a function of the stakeholders\u2019 roles, their interrelationships, articulations of value, and governance principles. Addressing the politics of data, we considered the actors\u2019 competitive struggles for governing data. This conceptualisation brings to the forefront the power relations and multifaceted economic and social interactions within data governance models emerging in an environment mainly dominated by corporate actors. These models highlight that civic society and public bodies are key actors for democratising data governance and redistributing value produced through data. Through the discussion of the models, their underpinning principles and limitations, the article wishes to inform future investigations of socio-technical imaginaries for the governance of data, particularly now that the policy debate around data governance is very active in Europe.",
