      "abstract": "\n I propose an analysis of lying with uninformative speech acts. The orthodox view states that lying is restricted to assertions. However, the growing case for non-assertoric lies made by presuppositions or conventional implicatures challenges this orthodoxy. So far, the only presuppositions to have been considered as lies were informative presuppositions. In fact, uninformative lies were not discussed in the philosophical literature. However, limiting the possibility of lying to informative speech acts is too restrictive. Firstly, I show that standard, uninformative presuppositions can also be lies. Secondly, I extend this picture into uninformative lies made by declarative statements. To implement my proposal, I do not need a new definition of lying. Recently popular commitment-based definitions of lying are able to properly handle uninformative lies.",

      "abstract": "The distinction between lying and mere misleading is commonly tied to the distinction between saying and conversationally implicating. Many definitions of lying are based on the idea that liars say something they believe to be false, while misleaders put forward a believed-false conversational implicature. The aim of this paper is to motivate, spell out, and defend an alternative approach, on which lying and misleading differ in terms of commitment: liars, but not misleaders, commit themselves to something they believe to be false. This approach entails that lying and misleading involve speech-acts of different force. While lying requires the committal speech-act of asserting, misleading involves the non-committal speech-act of suggesting. The approach leads to a broader definition of lying that can account for lies that are told while speaking non-literally or with the help of presuppositions, and it allows for a parallel definition of misleading, which so far is lacking in the debate.",

      "abstract": "Time has multiple aspects and is difficult to define as one unique entity, which therefore led to multiple interpretations in physics and philosophy. However, if the perception of time is considered as a composite time concept, it can be decomposed into basic invariable components for the perception of progressive and support-fixed time and into secondary components with possible association to unit-defined time or tense. Progressive time corresponds to Bergson\u2019s definition of duration without boundaries, which cannot be divided for measurements. Time periods are already lying in the past and fixed on different kinds of support. The human memory is the first automatic support, but any other support suitable for time registration can also be considered. The true reproduction of original time from any support requires conditions identical to the initial conditions, if not time reproduction becomes artificially modified as can be seen with a film. Time reproduction can be artificially accelerated, slowed down, extended or diminished, and also inverted from the present to the past, which only depends on the manipulation of the support, to which time is firmly linked. Tense associated to progressive and support fixed time is a psychological property directly dependent on an observer, who judges his present as immediate, his past as finished and his future as uncertain. Events can be secondarily associated to the tenses of an observer. Unit-defined time is essential for physics and normal live and is obtained by comparison of support-fixed time to systems with regular motions, like clocks. The association of time perception to time units can also be broken. Einstein\u2019s time units became relative, in quantum mechanics, some physicist eliminated time units, others maintained them. Nevertheless, even the complete elimination of time units is not identical to timelessness, since the psychological perception of progressive and support-fixed time still remains and cannot be ignored. It is not seizable by physical methods, but experienced by everybody in everyday life. Contemporary physics can only abandon the association of time units or tenses to the basic components in perceived time.",

It argues that much of what is assumed as novel and unexpected in the ongoing discussion has been anticipated by Arendt in the 1950\u2019s and the 1960\u2019s. Furthermore, it states that her insights and categories provide a deeper understanding of the matter, thus contributing to dismiss common dead-locks in recent debate. Still, there are, in Arendt\u2019s analysis, perplexities \u2013 explored and unexplored by her \u2013 that deserve our attention in order to grasp the nature of facts and truth. In this line, this paper answers the question put forward in its title \u2013 Can there be alternative-facts? - relying on a (Arendt inspired) defense of objective truth, which requires a specific definition of politics and some qualified ontological claims about political reality.",

      "abstract": "Although lying is an action which is fundamental for human communication, there are not many analyses that treat lying from a linguistic point of view. This paper treats lying on the background of recent discussions of the semantics-pragmatics interface. On the one hand, lying has to do with truth and falsehood; since these are semantic notions, there is a semantic side of lying. On the other hand, lying has to do with the speech act of assertion, and this is a genuine pragmatic notion. Semantic and pragmatic aspects go into a proper definition of lying as proposed in this paper. On the basis of typical scenarios it is shown how lying may be distinguished from deception and misleading. It is argued that lying is an act of verbal deception; however, deception has not to be implemented into the definition of lying as a separate condition. This line of argument runs against recent approaches in the philosophy of language (cf. Carson 2010) that defend the view that lying does not include deception. Furthermore, at least some cases of misleading in the sense of Saul (2012) may be analysed as cases of untruthful implicatures. The latter are considered as a part of the total act of lying (see Meibauer 2005, Meibauer 2011, Meibauer 2014a, Meibauer 2014b, and Meibauer 2014c). In the course of this paper further acts such as so-called bald-faced lies, selfless assertions, and bullshitting are discussed and related to the overall topic of lying.",

To answer this question, we have drawn on the reflections of Eliezer Berkovits, who has defined Jewish philosophy as the incorporation of philosophical concepts and reasoning into a distinct Hebraic framework of thought and tradition. Using Mendelssohn\u2019s Jerusalem as a case study, we refine and extend the concept of incorporation to show that Jewish philosophy is articulated between the universality of philosophical thought and the particularity of Jewish tradition.",

The study correlates the post-traditionalist exhaustion of the translation arsenal, intended to transmit God\u2019s Word in human languages, with the shift of a translator\u2019s self-definition dialogic, reduced to the intersubjective communication horizontal in the transition from traditionalism to historicism and predicting the detachment of the elaboration of appropriate criteria of translating the Holy Scripture into different languages from God\u2019s Revealed Truth. The research emphasizes the premises for re-establishing the interpersonal dialogical vertical in the translation theory and practice, which are predicted by the contemporary conceptions of translators\u2019 activity, aimed at reconstructing God Breathed narratives, such as the model of dynamic/functional equivalence, introduced by E.A.Nida and J. de Waard, the cross-cultural approach, proposed by G.Gravelle, the matrix of applying the indicators of the great literature in L.Ryken\u2019s metadiscription and the literary equivalence method, elaborated by A.S.Desnitsky. On the base of the comparing the recent technologies of translation, elaborated to provide the personal access of the different languages speakers to the Old Testament and the New Testament, the analysis proves, that the achievement of the primary and final aim of the interlingual communicative interaction predicts overcoming the secularist separation of the spiritual and the rational dimensions of the personhood in the course of the dialogue arhitechtonics reflective reconstruction, initiated by the post-non-classical rediscovery of the rationally unmediated communicability as the pre-cognitive core of personality.",

The intricacy of this notion concerns the intrinsic question of human existence, guiding individuals toward truth and goodness. It occupies the intersection of human nature and divinity, anthropology and theology. Plato\u2019s description of the cosmic origin of the soul is, to some extent, imbued with the mythological character inherent in Western philosophy. Plato posits that the soul and body are separate; the soul is an eternal, transcendent, and independent spiritual entity, and the existence of the theory of Forms must be mediated through the soul. Aristotle, on the other hand, offers a theory regarding human cognitive abilities; he rejects the separation of the soul and body, while asserting that the soul holds a superior and fundamental existence in relation to the body. Plato\u2019s doctrine (centered on justice) and Aristotle\u2019s theory (centered on virtue) present significant divergences, yet both emphasize the essential value of the human soul, asserting that human reason is the essence of the soul. This reason, as the essential attribute of humanity, ultimately aims to establish a rational order among human beings.",

It is argued that the emergence of philosophy of engineering is a result of a growing empirical orientation and ethical problematization in philosophy and the social studies of science and technology. In the engineered sociotechnical world, both descriptive and normative research of engineering practices is required for responsibilization of technological action. An empirically informed philosophical study of engineering includes the ontological, epistemological, and ethical aspects of engineering activity, overcoming the opposition of its context and content. Engineering is a specifically modern form of action in the world and at the same time can contribute to philosophical anthropology and the theory of human creativity. Institutionalization of philosophy of engineering becomes possible when (and where) a coalition of the interested actors has been formed, including the professional associations of engineering, academy, and policymakers. The overview concludes with deliberations on perspectives of the field in Russia, where a significant corpus of studies of engineering has been accumulated \u2013 yet, philosophy of engineering is not institutionalized, and remains an exotic label.",

In particular, it deals with the work of Roderick Chisholm and Thomas Feehan, Charles Fried, David Simpson, Bernard Williams, Thomas Carson, Roy Sorensen, Don Fallis, Andreas Stokke, and Terence Cuneo. It focuses on their answers to, first, the analytical questions of how lying is to be defined and whether lying involves an intent to deceive, and second, the moral questions of why lying is morally wrong and whether lying is morally worse than other forms of deception. Although their answers to these questions are closely related, it treats them separately. The overall conclusion is that there is much disagreement about the correct answers.",

Constructional and/or complementary theories are defined as general/specific, and interaction theories, relationship theories, and hybrid theories are specifically mentioned. Accordingly, the interactions between the disciplines of law and justice are explained in more detail. Then, the general definition of engineering and philosophy of engineering are explained. The interactions between engineering and law are specifically evaluated, and interactions between engineering and 52 types of law are defined and case studies found in the literature are indicated for each. Then interactions between engineering and justice briefly mentioned.\nRelationships/interactions between engineering and 25 different types of justice discussed and evaluated with specific examples. Emphasis was placed on the historical development of the subject of philosophy in general, and philosophy of law was defined more specifically. Some of the philosophers of law and their areas of interest are presented in a table format and compared. The new perspective of philosophy was defined and the disciplines of R-Philosophy, RScience, R-Justice, R-Law, R-Engineering, and R-Religion were expressed with the relevant basic concepts. New Era Philosophy, new and reconstructed Basic Philosophies, and Ideal Philosophical System explained generally. New perspective for the philosophy of justice is defined by considering the related new theories. Philosophy of defense, philosophy of equity, philosophy of equivalence, philosophy of judgment, philosophy of law, philosophy of protection, philosophy of punishment, and philosophy of rights are defined due to new perspective of philosophy. Also, philosophy of engineering law, philosophy of information technology law, philosophy of telecommunication law, and philosophy of security are defined by taking into account hybrid philosophies and general theories related to them. The interaction of engineering, law, justice, and basic philosophies has been generally expressed.",

      "abstract": "The works of Alexius Meinong are dedicated to various strategies for describing existing and nonexistent things. An important role in his theory is played by the idea of a preju\u00addice in favor of the actual, which explains his desire to find a correct description of the ontological status of nonexistent entities. He specifically examined things like the round square, the existent golden mountain, and many others; however, his writings show no signs or attempts to describe the ontological status of \u201cnothing\u201d. In this regard, one of the objectives of this study is to determine whether it is possible to provide a co\u00adherent description of \u201cnothing\u201d while avoiding contradictions solely using the tools of his theory. Simultaneously, within contemporary analytical metaphysics, this concept has be\u00adgun to be regarded as an independent object of investigation. Many representatives of the so-called nuclear school of Meinongian philosophy have attempted to address the problem of \u201cnothing\u201d by formulating their own theories and approaches. Therefore, this paper also examines such approaches to solving the problem of \u201cnothing\u201d, as presented in the works of Parsons, Routley, and Jacquette. Although Parsons and Jacquette devel\u00adoped and interpreted Meinong\u2019s ideas, they sought to adhere to the fundamental princi\u00adples of his theory, including the distinction between nuclear and extra-nuclear proper\u00adties. In this context, it is necessary to identify the merits and shortcomings of each ap\u00adproach, as well as to compare their principles with the main tenets of the original theory of objects. The problem of \u201cnothing\u201d becomes particularly relevant in the context of the development of modern Meinongian theories, where the question arises about the possibility of considering it as an intentional object in principle. How can we even conceive of \u201cnothing\u201d? What properties might it have? We have attempted to address these questions in this study.",

When these fragments are read in proper relation to each other, they reveal for the first time many of the key innovations of Benjamin as a philosopher, as well as his points of influence on Horkheimer and Adorno. His early \u2018Program\u2019 critiques the Enlightenment conception of experience as a means for gaining empirical knowledge, and announces the need for a new concept of experience. Benjamin follows through on this program with a method of philosophical enquiry that is by turns fragmentary and constellational, developing a series of provisional notions of experience, which form a constellation with one another: perception, mimesis, language as a medium of experience, observation and memory.",

Ultimately, this study seeks to bridge the gap between philosophy and mysticism, demonstrating an argumentative framework for inte- grating mystical insight into philosophical discourse.",

To achieve this goal, the concepts of Islamic philosophy of education were analyzed, along with the socio-cultural realities of Kazakh society. The study identified that the idea of potential development is inherent in the very definition of personality, and its roots are found not only in modern anthropocentric attitudes but also in ancient religious teachings, including Islam. It also high-lighted that the educational influence of Islam is comprehensive. Religious teachings affect people\u2019s moral and ethical lives, their intellectual abilities, their level of spiritual development, happiness, and the well-being of family life, and therefore the upbringing of future generations. In Islamic understanding, self-developmentis not only an individual\u2019s opportunity but also their duty, mission, and potentia (potential), which are inherent from birth. Key concepts of Islamic philosophy of education that fundamentally impact the development of an individual\u2019s educational potential are identified. Among these concepts are aqidah, sharia, akhlaq, sabr, ji-had, zakat, and others. In the Republic of Kazakhstan, Islam\u2019s influence on educational processes is signifi-cant, although secular traditions, introduced during the atheistic worldview of the USSR (Union of Soviet So-cialist Republics), still dominate. Religious self-awareness in Kazakhstan also positively affects patriotic edu-cation, as it emphasizes the ethnic culture of the Kazakh people and their uniqueness. The study contributes to the field of religious studies, particularly in its application to educational and Enlightenment ideas, and it pro-vides a deeper understanding of the socio-cultural environment of Kazakhstan.",

Remarkably, these chatbots are already capable of correctly identifying causes in cases that are hotly debated in the literature. In order to assess the results of these LLMs and future dedicated AI, we propose a definition of cause in neuron diagrams with a wider validity than published hitherto, which challenges the widespread view that such a definition is elusive. We submit that these results are an illustration of how future philosophical research might evolve: as an interplay between human and artificial expertise.",

      "abstract": "The study aims to gain a philosophical understanding of the ethnoreligious essence of the Great Patriotic War as one of the fundamental components of updating philosophy of religion in the context of a philosophical analysis of the problem of ethnocultural identity of modern Russian society. Along with this, the Russian religious studies community is invited to use not only a destructive, but also a constructive understanding of ethnoreligiosity. The scientific novelty of the study lies in the fact that within the framework of the problem under study, the concepts of \u201cfolk religion\u201d, \u201creligious extremism\u201d, \u201cquasi-religious extremism\u201d are discussed and compared. Based on this analysis, the authors, through the identification of the concepts of ethnoreligiosity and folk religion, offer a different definition of ethnoreligiosity. Through understanding the phenomenon of ethnoreligiosity as a practice of identifying the presence of ethnocultural subjectivity within the framework of a historical event of global significance, the authors outline research prospects for ethnoreligious discourse in modern philosophy of religion. At the same time, the fundamental role of ethnoreligiosity is emphasized within the framework of the problem of establishing normal historical continuity of socio-cultural development of Russia as a practice of preventing the loss of historical memory and falsification of the history of its peoples. As a result of the study, the artificiality of the dominance of many deconstructive Russophobic research practices in assessing the meaning of the Great Patriotic War and the Victory in it is noted. Through the analysis of the phenomenon of ethnoreligiosity, the socio-consolidating nature of understanding this event is revealed as a philosophical practice of representing the presence of ethnocultural subjectivity in the framework of mass objectification. The debatable nature of the proposed problematic is noted. At the same time, research prospects for abandoning the dead-end neoliberal discourse in assessing the historical development of the Russian ethno-confessional community are affirmed.",

Berdyaev\u2019s views on his understanding of freedom of will in the context of cultural philosophy (reality created by man through a creative act), since the thinker considered not the category of being as the primary basis of the world, but the category of freedom, on the basis of which God created man as a free creative being capable of creating reality. The scientific novelty lies in N.A. Berdyaev\u2019s definition of the concept of free will not only as an irrational category by its nature, endowed with the ability to lead a person to both good and evil, but also as a cross\u2013cutting theme in his understanding of the conjugacy of God \u2013 the world \u2013 man, where man makes his choice through freedom. It is shown that N.A. Berdyaev\u2019s philosophy of freedom is connected with the personal traits of a person, his spiritual qualities, since it originates in the transcendent infinity and is a defining feature of human existence, its world of values, and the world of culture. It is shown that the realization of a person\u2019s choice of freedom in N.A. Berdyaev\u2019s philosophy are the categories of creativity, creativity, and commitment to religious values; and the negative choice of freedom (a person\u2019s inability to manage it) results in enslavement of the individual to idols: art, science, and technocratic progress. Therefore, in the philosophy of N.A. Berdyaev, the fundamental position is the correctness of a person\u2019s choice of a vector of freedom that can unleash his creative potential and become the basis of life determination.",

These concepts continue to attract considerable attention from modern re-searchers. This article delves into the philosophy of Mikhail Mikhailovich Tareev, professor of the Moscow The-ological Academy, whose stance is distinguished by objectivity and boldness of judgments. The article analyz-es M.M. Tareev's definition of religion, the boundaries of rational cognition concerning morality, and the histori-cal stages of religious development. As a result of the study the moral right to criticize religion by an individual is proved, while simultaneously highlighting the necessity of a close union between religion and morality in the historical evolution of society. M.M. Tareev transcended the boundaries of theological scholarship, addressing the problem from a universal perspective and objectively delineating the key aspects of the relationship be-tween religion and morality. The novelty of this study lies in the introduction of reconciling argumentation into scientific circulation and its focus against the abuse of religious dogmas. This article aims to elucidate the po-tential inherent in studies of morality and religion, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of their com-plex interplay.",

      "abstract": "B a c k g r o u n d . The article reveals the key methodological problems of historical and philosophical research of the creative heritage of Indian thinkers. The first of them is the definition of criteria for recognizing the philosophical component in the content of the intellectual discourse of Indians, reflected in the literary heritage that does not lose its relevance and has been developing for several millennia. The second is the prospects for the historical study of Indian philosophy and the arguments and counterarguments of this approach.\n\nM e t h o d s . We used general scientific methods, such as analysis, synthesis, comparison and description to reveal specific problems of the methodology of studying the history of Indian philosophy. An interdisciplinary approach was implemented, which made it possible to use the best practices of historians, methodologists of science and philologists.\n\nR e s u l t s . The definition of the criteria for the historicity of the original source in historicist theories is inextricably linked with the definition of the criteria for its philosophic nature, in particular, in the works of Chattopadhyay D. and Ruben V. The vulnerability and relevance of historicist concepts in modern times argues for the expediency of recognizing the relative autonomy of questions: \"What is philosophical?\" and, \"What is historical?\" in the methodological substantiation of research on the history of Indian philosophy.\n\nThe lack of a clear and distinct historical identity in the Indian cultural tradition has deprived researchers of the reliance on periodization that would have been formed by the Indians themselves during the development of their philosophical thought. This explains the significant differences between the most well-known methods of periodization of Indian philosophy, among other things, in the works of Radhakrishnan S., Biardo M., Franco E. At the same time, the widespread attitude among Indians to the original texts as timeless and unquestioningly authoritative, the lack of signs of \"Paradigm revolutions\" in the Kun interpretation of this lexeme, led to the rejection of periodization of Indian philosophy, for example, in the works of Chatterjee S. and Dutt D. And a critical reinterpretation of the tradition of periodization of the history of philosophy in the Western world became the basis for the original periodization of Plott J. Due to the lack of verifiable grounds for asserting the objectivity of the historical process as a whole, researchers are free to create certain ways of their own periodization of the history of Indian philosophy in accordance with the needs of their research and with a clear recognition of their convention and instrumentality.\n\nC o n c l u s i o n s . The basis of the discussion about the historicity of Indian philosophy in modern times is the question: is it justified to talk about history when it is not about distinguishing the modern from the outdated? The vulnerability of the assumption that it is possible to study the works of representatives of a tradition that has been going on for several millennia, without taking into account the specifics of the specific historical situation of the time and the conditions of their creation, encourages us to recognize the expediency of observing the principle of historicityin the research of Indian philosophy. The historical approach in the study of Indian philosophy is not the only possible one, but it fully meets the modern needs of scientific discourse and can be recognized as one of the priorities.",

The methodological basis of the work includes historical-philosophical, philological-translation, logical-semantic approach and comparative method. The scientific novelty of the study is that the concept of the thinker is shown by the author as a socio-philosophical system, the elements of which are the goal, subject and sub-subject of the craft. It is emphasized that the subject-chain process allows the elements to interact in the system, which represents the original con-cept of the craft of the Safavid thinker in the light of the Islamic and European philosophical tradition. The main conclusions of the study are: definition of the meaning of craft as any occupation, as a form of knowledge that encourages a person to actions of a certain nature; the division of crafts in the concept of the thinker is made into labor and non-labor, but there is no clear line between them. The relevance of this research lies in drawing attention to a relatively understudied issue in the history of philosophy. The article not only broadens the under-standing of Mir Findiriski\u2019s philosophy but also opens new avenues for further research in this field.",

Legacies of viral pandemics unfortunately do not include sufficient research on how the acute symptoms of infection evolved into chronic health conditions. More so, the idea of surviving a viral pandemic with long-lasting symptoms is not new, yet it is curiously disjointed as a medical concept throughout documented histories on the subject. Individuals with long-term conditions that are rooted in acute viral infections, such as COVID-19, require a coordinated system of care that includes comprehensive rehabilitation. This commentary will discuss the philosophical underpinnings of the historical scarcity of documented incidences of individuals with chronic virus symptoms and the need for a shift in post-viral infection treatment approaches. Long-COVID, also known as Post-COVID Conditions (PCC) or Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), refers to a wide range of health conditions that can involve one or more organ systems, with chronicity manifesting across a wide range of symptoms [1].

Al-Junayd defines taw\u1e25\u012bd in terms of separating the eternally existing (qad\u012bm) from the temporally generated (mu\u1e25dath). This study argues that Plato\u2019s distinction between \u201cthat which is and always is\u201d and \u201cthat which comes to be and never is\u201d in the Timaeus better clarifies neglected aspects of al-Junayds\u2019s definition than the orthodox Neo-Platonic interpretation put forward by Ali Hassen Abdel Kader. Given the lacuna of historically decisive textual evidence in support of either interpretation, this study will demonstrate how the Platonic distinction, which was widely circulating in the theological and philosophical circles of the ninth and early tenth century Baghdad, better furnishes a more coherent interpretation of al-Junayd\u2019s positions. The first part of the study suggests that al-Junayd\u2019s definition of taw\u1e25\u012bd could best be described as a creatively epistemic appropriation and development of the Platonic essentially metaphysical distinction. Through a careful examination of his theory of self-consciousness, the second part of the study explains how al-Junayd developed his epistemic definition of taw\u1e25\u012bd in response to the charges of pantheism addressed to Sufisms. This examination will further support my claim that a Platonic, rather than a Neo-Platonic, framework better explains the philosophical foundation of al-Junayd\u2019s conception and definition of monotheism. I conclude by indicating how this study\u2019s results contribute to the larger scholarship on philosophy and formation of early Sufism.",

Aristotle presents three puzzles about the existence of time with reference to the \u201cNow\u201d. Modern interpretations often view this section as an aporetic prelude with Aristotle\u2019s failure to provide explicit solutions. This paper examines Simplicius\u2019 alternative interpretation, which draws upon the theory of proof and the syllogistic model from the Posterior Analytics. Simplicius contends that the arguments\u2019 failure lies in their inability to fit within the suitable syllogistic framework to establish a demonstrable definition of time, not in their aporetic nature. Every science has to prove the relation between (i) establishing whether X exists and (ii) showing what X is by establishing what the cause of X is. In evaluating Simplicius\u2019 interpretation, this paper addresses two key aspects of the exegesis of IV.10: firstly, Simplicius can show why the \u201cNow\u201d is not part of the definition of time, and secondly, the ancient commentator underscores the close connection between the arguments in Physics IV.10 and the broader context of Aristotle\u2019s discussion of time. Modern interpreters fail to address both of these issues.",

      "abstract": "The inquiry into the moral status of artificial intelligence (AI) is leading to prolific theoretical discussions. A new entity that does not share the material substrate of human beings begins to show signs of a number of properties that are nuclear to the understanding of moral agency. It makes us wonder whether the properties we associate with moral status need to be revised or whether the new artificial entities deserve to enter within the circle of moral consideration. This raises the foreboding that we are at the gates of an anthropological crisis: the properties bound to moral agency have been exclusively possessed in the past by human beings and have shaped the very definition of being human. In this article, I will argue that AI does not lead us to an anthropological crisis and that, if we adhere to the history and philosophy of technology, we will notice that the debate on the moral status of AI uncritically starts from an anthropology of properties and loses sight of the relational dimension of technology. First, I will articulate three criteria for analyzing different anthropological views in philosophy of technology. Second, I will propose six anthropological models: traditional, industrial, phenomenological, postphenomenological, symmetrical, and cyborg. Third, I will show how the emergence of AI breaks with the dynamics of increased relationality in the history and philosophy of technology. I will argue that this aspect is central to debates about the moral status of AI, since it sheds light on an aspect of moral consideration that has been obscured. Finally, I will reject entirely relational approaches to moral status and propose two hybrid possibilities for rethinking it.",

Here, we relate the implications of our Fairness formula to economic theories of fair division. Our analysis makes contributions to both philosophy and economics: to the philosophical literature, we add an axiomatic discussion of proportionality and fairness. To the economic literature, we add an appealing normative theory of absolute and comparative fairness that can be used to evaluate axioms and division rules. Also, we provide a novel definition and characterization of the absolute priority rule.",

      "abstract": "The article examines the artistic and journalistic texts of A. Prokhanov and Z. Prilepin, demonstrating a conscious, multifaceted and multi-genre form of presence in the historical and cultural process. Creating an artistic text is an important, but not the only way to convey personal ideas. The purpose of the study is to identify the individual and common features of the artistic, journalistic and biographical plots of each of the two writers. The scientific novelty lies in the definition of stable artistic and journalistic historiosophical plots of Prokhanov and Prilepin, often carried out through a type of hero specific to each of the two authors. The results showed that the hypothesis put forward about the conscious construction of a historically determined destiny by two writers, in which literary creativity is consistent with ideology and politics, was confirmed. In the construction of artistic plots, with the general intention of the authors to synthesize with journalism, Prokhanov is prone to repetition, while Prilepin in each new work turns to a different genre, hero, plot. A significant difference in the poetics of texts is also the difference in the forms of addressing a particular historical figure. It is possible to establish not just general ideological positions between two writers, but relations of continuity. The desire for a strong state, anti-liberalism, and the synthesis of journalistic and artistic words remain common to all forms of their presence.",

      "abstract": "Rationale of Study \u2013 This paper delves into the interconnectedness of African indigenous knowledge, situating its historical roots and the inherent philosophy embedded in its practice. African indigenous knowledge encompasses formulating a definition of knowledge in an African context and the justification of knowledge, which has its stand on cultural, linguistic, aphorism, and proverbial content. Scholars, however, argue that its historical foundation lies in the depths of time, tracing back to the ancient civilisations that thrived across the continent. On the other hand, its philosophical discourse serves as the guiding force behind the practices and beliefs of various communities. Within this purview, this paper sets out to close this gap.Methodology \u2013 This paper adopts primary and secondary data sources, including oral information, books, articles, and journals. However, it uses argumentative and analytic philosophical and historical inquiry methods to highlight that African indigenous knowledge is pivotal in preserving historical and philosophical insights.Findings \u2013 The study finds an interlink between history and philosophy in advancing African indigenous knowledge and its practice of knowing and justifying the indubitable truth that cannot be objectively attained in Western epistemology.Implications \u2013 The study contributes to the existing debate that the wisdom embedded in proverbs, myths, and folklore is a repository of philosophical principles, offering guidance on ethics, social harmony, and the relationship between humanity and nature through historical insights.Originality \u2013 The paper concludes that African indigenous knowledge has its own social and cultural dimension. It addresses the problem of knowledge by dividing its domain into rational, empirical, and mystical components, solving the problem of justification in the African context.",
