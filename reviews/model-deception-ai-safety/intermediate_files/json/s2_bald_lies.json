      "abstract": "The traditional conception of lying, according to which to lie is to make an assertion with an intention to deceive the hearer, has recently been put under pressure by the phenomenon of bald-faced lies i.e. utterances that prima facie look like lies but because of their blatancy allegedly lack the accompanying intention to deceive. In this paper we propose an intuitive way of reconciling the phenomenon of bald-faced lies with the traditional conception by suggesting that the existing analyses of the phenomenon overlook a non-obvious category of hearers whom the speakers of bald-faced lies intend to deceive. Those hearers are institutions represented by the people involved, such as courts or secret police. We also criticize two recent rival accounts (Jessica Keiser\u2019s and Daniel Harris\u2019s) that attempt to save the traditional conception by saying that some bald-faced lies are not assertions, because they are conventional\u2014rather than illocutionary\u2014speech acts.",

      "abstract": "Bald-faced lies are utterances that seem to lack the intent of the speaker to deceive the hearer, which is usually assumed in the definition of proper lying. Therefore, the so-called non-deceptionists call the latter assumption into question. The so-called deceptionists, sticking to the traditional definition of lying, argue in turn that bald-faced lies either are no real lies or are connected to an intention to deceive. The chapter gives a concise overview of the main positions in this dispute, discusses the cases typically employed to illustrate bald-faced lies, and summarizes recent experimental findings on how ordinary speakers perceive bald-faced lies. It turns out that ordinary speakers often think that bald-faced lies are lies and that they are deceptive at the same time. This poses problems for both the deceptionists and the non-deceptionists.",

At the center of recent discussion stand bald-faced lies, which have proven to be remarkably resistant to philosophical analysis. This chapter focuses on a related, yet curiously under-explored, set of cases: lies that we construct together, as friends, families, colleagues, and communities. This sort of lie exhibits a degree of moral and linguistic complexity not found in more standard examples of lying. That moral complexity will ultimately put pressure on the enduring thesis that the distinctive wrong of lying is that it threatens to undermine the potential for communication. The linguistic complexity, in contrast, will stand as a challenge to standard theories of conversational dynamics.",

It argues that bald-faced lies aren\u2019t lies, because they\u2019re not assertions. The chapter begins by arguing that lies must be assertions. Next, it sketches a view of assertion according to which a constitutive rule of asserting is being responsive to evidence in a particular way. Then, focusing on two well-known examples of bald-faced lies, it argues that those speakers don\u2019t assert anything; rather, they do something more like what an actor does. The argument thus removes an important objection to the intent-to-deceive tradition. It also offers a different way of thinking about lying. Defenders of bald-faced lies sometimes describe them as attempts to \u2018go on record\u2019. This chapter defends an alternate view according to which lying involves taking a kind of (epistemic) responsibility for the content of one\u2019s utterance.",
