      "abstract": "As contemporary asset\u2010pricing models have expanded to include new factors, the empirical literature has carefully studied the time\u2010series fit of competing model specifications. In contrast, comparison of the roles played by characteristics and factor loadings in explaining cross\u2010sectional return variation has received less attention. This paper re\u2010examines the characteristics versus covariance debate. The findings overwhelmingly support the characteristics explanation. Firm size, book\u2010to\u2010market, profitability and investment characteristics are important for understanding differences in returns, over and above how a stock loads on common risk factors. Portfolios designed to be a pure play on a given characteristic generate economically significant trading profits.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This demonstration of study focalizes the melting transport and inclined magnetizing effect of cross fluid with infinite shear rate viscosity along the Skan-Falkner wedge. Transport of energy analysis is brought through the melting process and velocity distribution is numerically achieved under the influence of the inclined magnetic dipole effect. Moreover, this study brings out the numerical effect of the process of thermophoresis diffusion and Brownian motion. The infinite shear rate of viscosity model of cross fluid reveals the set of partial differential equations (PDEs). Similarity transformation of variables converts the PDEs system into nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Furthermore, a numerical bvp4c process is imposed on these resultant ODEs for the pursuit of a numerical solution. From the debate, it is concluded that melting process cases boost the velocity of fluid and velocity ratio parameter. The augmentation of the minimum value of energy needed to activate or energize the molecules or atoms to activate the chemical reaction boosts the concentricity.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease associated with inflammation. Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulatory effects. Whether vitamin D levels are correlated with endometriosis is a subject of ongoing debate. This study aimed to examine the association between endometriosis and serum vitamin D levels. From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this study examined the cross-sectional data of American women aged 20\u201354 years from 2001 to 2006. After adjusting for covariates, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess correlations. A total of 3,232 women were included in this study. The multiple linear regression model demonstrated a negative correlation between the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) concentration and the risk of endometriosis after controlling for all confounding variables. The odds ratio was 0.73 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.54\u20130.97 in the adequate vitamin D level group compared with the insufficient vitamin D level group. Our results showed that endometriosis was inversely correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship and determine the potential benefits of maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels for endometriosis prevention.",

      "abstract": "Background Numerous studies have shown that the dietary inflammatory index (DII) is associated with adverse health effects. However, the relationship between DII and prostate cancer (PCa) remains controversial. Although alcohol is included in DII as a dietary factor, the various adverse health effects of alcohol consumption are not only related to inflammation. On the other hand, it has been a long-standing debate whether alcohol consumption is linked to the risk of PCa. Therefore, to clarify whether drinking affects the relationship between DII and PCa, we evaluated the correlation between DII and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Methods We used data from the NHANES spanning from 2005 to 2010 to analyze the relationship between PCa and DII. Out of the 31,034 NHANES participants, we enrolled 4,120 individuals in our study, utilizing dietary intake data from a twenty-four-hour period to determine DII scores. Demographic data, physical and laboratory test results were collected to compare between low PSA and high PSA groups, and to calculate the odds ratio between both groups, we employed a logistic regression analysis. Results In this cross-sectional investigation of PCa, drinkers and non-drinkers had different relationships between DII and PSA levels (OR: 1.2, 95% Cl: 1-1.44 vs. OR: 0.98, 95% Cl: 0.9\u20131.07), and DII and abstaining from alcohol were effective in reducing the incidence of PSA (p-value for significant interaction\u2009=\u20090.037). Conclusion The results of our study suggest that drinking may influence the relationship between DII and PSA levels. DII is likely to be a reliable indicator for estimating PSA levels among non-drinkers, who may limit their intake of pro-inflammatory ingredients to lower the incidence and death of PCa.",

There is still some debate on whether to do regular or selective upper endoscopy during the preoperative examination. The purpose of this study was to explore various endoscopic findings and Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients having laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) prior to surgery. Methods We investigated a cohort of 132 patients referred to the endoscopy unit from the bariatric surgery outpatient clinic for prebariatric esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as a part of preoperative LSG. Data extraction from medical records included clinical data such as body mass index (BMI), gastrointestinal symptoms (that include heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric pain, and nausea), medical comorbidities, and laboratory investigations. It included data about the endoscopic findings of EGD procedure as esophageal, gastric, and duodenal findings results as well as the results of biopsy specimens that were taken. Results Out of 132 patients, 29 (22%) had a BMI of less than 40\u2009kg/m2 whereas 103 (78%) had a BMI of 40\u2009kg/m2 or above, with an average of 44.4 \u00b1 6.4\u2009kg/m2. The average age of participants was 33.6 \u00b1 10.4 years. HP was detected in 36 patients (35.0%) with a slightly greater prevalence in patients with a higher BMI (33.7%) than in patients with lower BMI (35.0%). Collectively, 73 patients (55.7%) had positive endoscopic findings of various grades, sites, and combinations. Incompetent cardia (35.6%) was the most often seen esophageal finding, antral gastritis (34.1%) was the most frequently encountered gastric finding, and duodenitis 1st part was the commonest duodenal endoscopic finding (7.8%). Among asymptomatic patients, incompetent cardia was detected in 33.3%, antral gastritis was found in 30.1%, and around one-quarter of them were positive on HP testing (26.6%). Additionally, 16.1% of them had signs of reflux esophagitis, 17.2% had hiatal hernia, and 14.0% had nodular gastritis. Conclusion The current study revealed a high prevalence of positive endoscopic findings as well as HP infection upon routine endoscopic examination among patients undergoing bariatric surgery even those who were asymptomatic from any gastrointestinal symptoms.",

The Term Breech Trial (2000) highlighted elective caesarean section as a preferable method over vaginal delivery for breech presentations. This study investigates delivery modes in women who had an elective caesarean section for breech presentation in their first pregnancy. Objective was to evaluate delivery outcomes in the second pregnancy of women who had an elective caesarean section for breech presentation in their first pregnancy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional study was conducted at Jinnah International Hospital Abbottabad from October 10, 2018, to April 10, 2019. Data was collected from 321 women who had an elective caesarean section for breech presentation during their first pregnancy. The study used per-abdominal examination and obstetrical ultrasound to assess foetal presentation and recorded the mode of delivery in the second pregnancy.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants' ages ranged from 18 to 49 years, with a mean age of 28.87\u00b14.07 years. The average interval between deliveries was 1.92\u00b10.92 years, labour duration averaged 5.56\u00b12.41 hours, and foetal head engagement averaged 2.92\u00b11.35. Of the participants, 18.7% achieved a vaginal delivery, while 81.3% had a repeat caesarean section. Reasons for repeat caesarean included recurrent breech presentation in 44.9% and foetal distress in 32.4%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nApproximately 18.7% of women who had an elective caesarean section for breech presentation in their first pregnancy achieved vaginal delivery in their second pregnancy, whereas the majority underwent another elective caesarean section.",

      "abstract": "Detecting and treating glaucoma early is vital to prevent vision loss. Two main instruments, the Air Puff Tonometer and the Gold Standard Applanation Tonometer, are used to measure Intraocular Pressure (IOP). However, there is ongoing debate among ophthalmologists regarding the accuracy and reliability of these devices. Objective: To evaluate and contrast the measurements of intraocular pressure obtained through Air puff tonometry and Goldmann applanation tonometry. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was conducted upon 900 patients of Glaucoma, selected through purposive sampling technique, attending the Eye OPD of Isra University Hospital, Hyderabad. Patients with age more than 18 years, of both genders who provided consent for eye examination and treatment, were included in the study while patients with corneal disease or prior surgery, ocular trauma, or those presenting with active infection or ocular disease were excluded from the study. Results: 396 (44.0%) of patients were males and 504 (56.0%) were females. The results indicate that the mean IOP measurement for air puff tonometry (17.43 mm Hg) is significantly higher (p-value=0.0001) than the mean measurement obtained by Goldman tonometry (13.84 mm Hg). Overall, the distribution of IOP was similar for both types of tonometry, with a slightly higher proportion having high IOP values (19-22 mmHg) with Goldman tonometry compared to air puff tonometry. Conclusions: The findings of this research demonstrated a noteworthy contrast between the two techniques, where the air puff tonometry produced noticeably elevated intraocular pressure measurements in comparison to the widely accepted applanation tonometry",

      "abstract": "Background The effect of caffeine in coffee, a popular beverage, on gastrointestinal symptoms has been the subject of ongoing debate worldwide. The present study explored the association between caffeine intake and bowel habits and Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Methods Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2005\u20132010 were utilized for this cross-sectional survey. Bowel habits and IBD were defined by self-report. Logistic regression models assessed the linear relationship between caffeine intake and chronic constipation. Nonlinear associations were delineated using fitted smoothed curves and threshold effect analyses. Finally, subgroup analyses and interactions were used to test the stability of the findings. Results This population-based study included a total of 12,759 adults. We found that caffeine intake was negatively associated with chronic diarrhea. There was a U-shaped nonlinear relationship between caffeine intake and chronic constipation. To the left of breakpoint 2.04 (100 mg/1 unit), caffeine intake was negatively associated with chronic constipation (OR [95% CI]: 0.82 [0.74, 0.90]), however, to the right of the breakpoint, there was a positive association (OR [95% CI]: 1.06 [1.00, 1.12]). In addition, no significant association was found between caffeine intake and IBD. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests showed that caffeine intake was simply negatively associated with chronic constipation in older adults. Conclusion In conclusion, moderate caffeine intake may help with bowel movements, but excessive caffeine intake may cause chronic constipation. Appropriate caffeine intake in older adults may help prevent chronic constipation. This suggests that in our clinical practice, we need to strategize caffeine intake according to the population\u2019s defecation status.",

COPD is a molecularly based illness and one of the independent risk factors for lung cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma. This study uses spirometry to assess the relationship between the type and stage of LC and COPD in a group of LC patients at Arifin Achmad Hospital.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on lung cancer patients in Arifin Achmad Hospital, Pekanbaru, from June 2022 to December 2022. Based on spirometry examination, patients were grouped according to the degree of COPD. Then, the relationship between the COPD group and the type and degree of cancer was determined.\nResults: The study involved 52 patients predominantly male (71.2%), aged over 40 years (92.3%), Smokers and former smokers with Severe Brinkman index (69.2%), restrictive lung function (34.6%), COPD group D (40.4%), adenocarcinoma (61.5%), stage IV lung cancer (92,3%) and WHO Performance Status Scale 2 (61.5%). The FEV1/FVC rate in this study was 66.67%. There is a link between the stage of lung cancer and the\u00a0group of COPD (P=0.001).\nConclusion: There is a\u00a0relation between the\u00a0stage of LC in the\u00a0COPD group, which is predominantly with stage IV lung cancer, and group D of COPD.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Caffeine consumption, a ubiquitous habit in modern society, has been extensively examined for its effects on the human body. However, there is an ongoing debate about its positive and negative impacts, with an immediate rise in blood pressure and diverse results on an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and potential beneficial effects. In this cross-sectional study, we aim to investigate the effects of caffeine and its main metabolites on blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive patients over an intermediate term. Design and method: Utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2011 to 2014 (non-institutionalized US participants), including demographic variables, questionnaires, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) measurements, blood and urine laboratory results, linear regression analyses were performed, and corrections for established risk factors of hypertension were applied. Results: In the total cohort comprising normo- and hypertensive participants, higher caffeine intake (b=- 0.00485; P<0.0001), higher metabolite levels (theophylline: b=-0.05 5; p=0.010 and paraxanthine levels b=- 0.01 9; p=0.0296) correlated with lower SBP. Caffeine intake (b=0.003640; p<0.0001) and paraxanthine levels (b=0.03940; p<0.0001) were positively correlated with higher DBP. Among hypertensive participants, caffeine intake showed a significant correlation with lower SBP (b=- 0.00648; p=0.0013). Paraxanthine levels in urine the day after caffeine consumption correlated with higher DBP (b=0.0335; p=0.0332). In normotensive participants, higher caffeine intake correlated with lower SBP (b=-0.00265; P=0.001) but higher DBP (b=0.0031; P<0.0001). Paraxanthine levels correlated positively with higher DBP (b=0.01622; p=0.0329). There was a trend towards lower SBP in normotensive participants with higher theophylline levels (b=-0.03 48; p=0.050). Conclusions: Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study, we focused on non-acute effects of caffeine and the effects of its active metabolites and show that caffeine intake on the day before the measurement and paraxanthine and theophylline effects independent of caffeine levels are associated with lowered systolic blood pressure but higher diastolic blood pressure. This association appears irrespective of hypertension status. Our findings underline the importance of carefully considering caffeine intake when diagnosing and treating hypertension, addressing systolic and diastolic blood pressure.",

      "abstract": "Background Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are a real burden in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). They may appear in early pre-symptomatic stage as well as throughout the disease course. However, their relationship with the deterioration of the patient\u2019s quality of life (QoL) is still under debate. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of NMSs and their impact on the QoL in a cohort of Moroccan patients. Methods We carried out a cross-transactional study, where a total of 117 patients were submitted to a structured clinical interview and examination investigating motor and NMSs based on common and conventional scales. Motor symptoms were assessed by the UPDRS I\u2013VI during ON condition. The NMSs were evaluated with common scales and their relationship with the QoL was investigated. Results The mean patient\u2019s age was 60.77\u2009\u00b1\u200911.36\u2009years old, and the median disease duration was 6\u2009years [2.5\u20139.5]. Motor\u2019s phenotype subtypes were the mixed form in 40.2% of patients, akinetic-rigid in 20.5% and a tremor-dominant form in 39.3%. The median Hoehn and Yahr staging was 2 [1\u20132.5]. Regarding NMSs, the most common were urinary dysfunctions (82.6%), sleep (80.6%), and gastrointestinal (80%) disorders. Other autonomic dysfunctions were also frequent: thermoregulatory dysfunctions 58.6%, cardiovascular troubles 50.9%, and sexual dysfunctions 47.9%. Depression was present in 47.9% and fatigue symptoms in 23.1%. The median score of SCOPA-AUT was 14 [7.75\u201321.80]. The median PD questionnaire 39-score index (PDQ39-SI) was 23.22% and the most affected dimension was \u201cmobility.\u201d Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the SCOPA-AUT score impacted the QoL (p\u2009=\u20090.001), especially the gastrointestinal (p\u2009=\u20090.007), and cardiovascular (p\u2009=\u20090.049) dimensions. Conclusion Our data show that all patients have presented at least one NMS. Autonomic and sleep disorders were the most frequent, and in contrast to other studies, digestive and cardiovascular disorders were rather the factors influencing negatively the QoL of patients. Understanding the pathophysiology of these NMSs should be placed at the forefront in order to develop new therapeutic approaches by improving the QoL of PD patients.",

      "abstract": "Ascariasis, caused by the parasitic roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides, is a major public health issue, especially in developing nations such as Pakistan. It impacts millions, causing significant morbidity through starvation, stunted growth in children, and a variety of gastrointestinal issues. The taxonomy of the Ascaris genus, notably the distinction between A. lumbricoides and Ascaris suum, has led to ongoing debate among parasitologists. Consequently, the current study intends to provide morphological characterization of A. lumbricoides from Pakistan, using scanning electron microscopy to uncover precise anatomical traits that may aid in resolving the taxonomic controversy surrounding the Ascaris genus. A cross\u2010sectional survey of 1641 individuals was undertaken. Participants filled out structured questionnaires and provided informed consent. After anthelmintic treatment, expelled worms were collected in sterile jars, washed, and preserved in a glycerin\u2010alcohol solution for morphometric examination. Histological examination of transverse section of female worm reproductive system was performed. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the head, cuticle, and caudal regions of the worms. Statistical analyses were performed using t\u2010tests and ANOVA, with significance determined as p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05. When the worms were collected, they ranged in hue from light to pale pink to reddish, then grayish\u2010white to creamy white. Female were distinguished on their large size, straight posterior end with no copulatory bursa and vulvar waist, while male worms were dorsally curved at posterior end. Of the 90 worms measured, 33 were males and 57 were females. The adult female Ascaris worms were significantly (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.0001) larger in body length and width as compared to adult male worms. Furthermore, adult females from different districts had significant differences in body length (p\u2009=\u20090.003) and width (p\u2009=\u20090.00004), although male body length did not differ substantially among districts (p\u2009=\u20090.243). Scanning electron microscopy of A. lumbricoides revealed a head with two subventral lips and a dorsal lip, as well as dentigerous ridges and a triradiate mouth. The cuticle had thick, transversely striated patterns, with clear contrasts between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. The male's caudal area contained mammiliform precloacal papillae and a rectangular anal orifice, but the female had a knob\u2010like structure with uneven striation pattern. The transverse section of female reproductive system consists of two large uteri containing developing eggs, coiled ovaries, and oviducts. Overall, the study revealed valuable insights on this nematode's complicated morphology. By adding new data to the current body of knowledge, this study seeks to improve our understanding of ascariasis and its implications for public health in affected regions.",

Though the field generally has a positive view of the second-generation nomothetic instruments available, the frequency of use falls far behind this favorable impression. The current paper reviewed two standardized instruments used in CST evaluations, the Evaluation of Competency to Stand Trial \u2013 Revised (ECST-R) and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT-CA). We first review the psychometric properties of both instruments, including a review of limitations. Next, we discuss the legal standing of both instruments, including a review of past admissibility challenges and a discussion of potential issues in cross-examination. Finally, we end with practical guidance for clinicians; namely, that these instruments are generally valid indicators of competence to stand trial and are likely to be particularly useful in cases where competence is ambiguous and the clinician would benefit from additional standardized data to make a clear clinical decision.",

Stresses imposed by the structure of the temporomandibular joint is imbalance and would interfere with the function of the temporomandibular joint. The etiology of temporomandibular disorder is multifactorial so that the relationship between tooth loss with temporomandibular disorders is a matter of debate in the field of dentistry. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship between tooth loss and the signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders which in terms of the number of tooth loss, the number of tooth loss quadrants, and the amount of occlusal support based on Eichner Index classification. The type of this study is descriptive analytic with cross-sectional design. The study was done in RSGM FKG USU, conducted through direct interviews using questionnaires and clinical examination on 100 subjects aged over 18 years with partial tooth loss. The results showed that the prevalence of tooth loss in part with temporomandibular disorder based on questionnaire is 59% while based on clinical examination is 86%. There is significant correlation between the number of tooth loss quadrants with temporomandibular disorder, while the number of tooth loss itself and the occlusal support are not associate with temporomandibular disorder. But it was found that there is an increased incidence of temporomandibular disorders along with an increase in the number of tooth loss.

      "abstract": "Objective: There is very limited evidence in the NHANES database linking serum apolipoprotein B and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) in adults aged 20\u201359 years. There are few studies associating apolipoprotein B concentrations with BMD, and there is some debate about the association between obesity and BMD. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the association between serum apolipoprotein B concentrations and lumbar spine BMD in adults aged 20\u201359 years and to predict its association with risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Methods: A cross-sectional study of the entire US ambulatory population was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database. Weighted multiple regression equation models were used to assess the association between serum apolipoprotein B and lumbar BMD. A logistic weighted regression model was used to assess the association between serum apolipoprotein B concentrations and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis. Subsequent stratified analyses were performed to refine the primary population of association. Results: Our study showed a significant negative association between serum apolipoprotein B concentration and lumbar BMD and a significant positive association with the risk of osteoporosis or osteopenia in the total population. After stratifying by sex, age and race, we concluded differently. The association of serum apolipoprotein B concentration with lumbar spine BMD and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis was significant in male, but not in female. After stratification by age, the negative association between serum apolipoprotein B concentrations and lumbar BMD and the positive association with risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis was more significant in the 30\u201339 and 50\u201359 years age groups. When stratified by race, serum apolipoprotein B concentrations were significantly negatively associated with lumbar BMD and positively associated with risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in Mexican American and non-Hispanic black populations. Thus, these findings suggest that these associations are influenced by sex, age, and race, respectively. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the association between serum apolipoprotein B levels and the risk of lumbar BMD and osteopenia or osteoporosis varies by sex, age, and race. In men, elevated serum apolipoprotein B levels were negative for bone quality. Elevated serum apolipoprotein B levels in the age groups 30\u201339 and 50\u201359 years also had a negative effect on bone quality. In the Mexican American and Non-Hispanic Black populations, elevated serum apolipoprotein B levels also had a significant negative effect on bone quality.",

Objectives: Evaluate the performance of possessors in the MMSE (Mini-mental State Examination) and MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), evaluating the influence of education on the performance of the participants. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, descriptive study with 33 participants without cognitive complaints. These were people aged 40 years or more, and at least four years of schooling. Data were formed in SPSS (v.23), using Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient (CS). Results: The population is predominantly composed of women (87.8%), with a mean age of 58 years (SD = \u00b1 9.5), and education of 11.7 years (SD = \u00b1 4.2 years). The median performance on the MMSE was 25 points (95%CI = 24.5-26.4) and, of these, 75.8% had a value equal to or greater than 24 points. At the same time, the median score in the MoCA was 20 points (95%CI = 18.6-21.7) and 18.2% of those evaluated scored equal to or greater than 26 points. As for the influence of education, there was a correlation for both tools (MMSE: CS = 0.457; p = 0.008; MoCA: CS = 0.556; p = 0.001). Regarding age, there was a correlation with MMSE performance (CS = 0.368; p = 0.035). Conclusion: MoCA and MEEM are correlated with the length of formal education. Thus, it is important to consider this factor when interpreting these scales.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to assess how large language models (LLMs) can be used for fact-checking and contribute to the broader debate on the use of automated means for veracity identification. To achieve this purpose, we use AI auditing methodology that systematically evaluates performance of five LLMs (ChatGPT 4, Llama 3 (70B), Llama 3.1 (405B), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Google Gemini) using prompts regarding a large set of statements fact-checked by professional journalists (16,513). Specifically, we use topic modeling and regression analysis to investigate which factors (e.g. topic of the prompt or the LLM type) affect evaluations of true, false, and mixed statements. Our findings reveal that while ChatGPT 4 and Google Gemini achieved higher accuracy than other models, overall performance across models remains modest. Notably, the results indicate that models are better at identifying false statements, especially on sensitive topics such as COVID-19, American political controversies, and social issues, suggesting possible guardrails that may enhance accuracy on these topics. The major implication of our findings is that there are significant challenges for using LLMs for factchecking, including significant variation in performance across different LLMs and unequal quality of outputs for specific topics which can be attributed to deficits of training data. Our research highlights the potential and limitations of LLMs in political fact-checking, suggesting potential avenues for further improvements in guardrails as well as fine-tuning.",

Yet, little is known about these preferences in today\u2019s polarized media environment, where partisan news consumption has surged. The current study explores this issue by providing a comprehensive and systematic examination of how citizens evaluate AI-attributed news compared to human-based news from like-minded and cross-cutting partisan sources. Using a preregistered conjoint experiment in the United States (\n N\n \u2009=\u20092,011) that mimics a high-choice media environment, we find that citizens evaluate AI-attributed news as negatively as cross-cutting news sources, both in terms of attitudes (perceived trustworthiness) and behavior (willingness to read the news story), while strongly preferring like-minded sources. These patterns remain stable across polarizing and non-polarizing issues and persist regardless of citizens\u2019 preexisting attitudes toward AI, political extremity, and media trust. Our findings thus challenge more optimistic views about AI\u2019s potential to facilitate exposure to diverse viewpoints. Moreover, they suggest that increased automation of news production faces both public mistrust and substantial reader resistance, raising concerns about the future viability of AI in journalism.\n",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is increasingly essential for medical students. However, without systematic characterization of the relevant components, designing targeted medical education interventions may be challenging. Objective This study aimed to systematically describe the levels of and factors associated with multidimensional AI literacy among Chinese medical students. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive analysis was conducted using data from a nationwide survey of Chinese medical students (N=80,335) across 109 medical schools in 2024. AI literacy was assessed with a multidimensional instrument comprising three domains: knowledge, evaluating students\u2019 self-reported proficiency in core areas of medical AI applications; attitude, reflecting their self-perceived views on using AI for teaching and learning; and behavior, capturing the self-perceived usage frequency and application patterns. Multivariate linear regression was applied to examine the associations between individual factors (ie, demographic characteristics, family background, and enrollment motivation) and environmental factors (ie, educational phase, type of education program, and tier of education program) and AI literacy. Results Respondents showed moderate to high levels of AI knowledge (mean 76.0, SD 26.9), followed by moderate AI attitude scores (mean 71.6, SD, 24.4). In contrast, AI behavior scores were much lower (mean 32.5, SD, 28.5), indicating little usage of AI tools. Of the individual factors, male students reported higher levels of AI attitude and behavior; both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation were positively associated with all three dimensions; advantaged family background was positively related to AI attitude and behavior, but not knowledge. Among the environmental factors, attending the prestigious Double First-Class universities was positively associated with higher AI usage. Enrollment in long-track medical education programs was associated with higher AI attitude and behavior, while being in the clinical phase was negatively associated with both AI knowledge and behavior. Environmental factors moderated the associations between individual characteristics and AI literacy, potentially attenuating disparities. Conclusions Medical students reported moderate to high AI knowledge, moderate AI favorability, and low AI use. Individual characteristics and environmental factors were significantly associated with AI literacy, and environmental factors moderated the associations. The moderate AI literacy overall highlights the need for AI-related medical education, ideally with practical use and nuanced by socioeconomic factors.",

The methodology employed a mixed-methods approach combining biometric signal analysis (facial recognition, heart rate, skin conductance), voice stress analytics, and machine learning models (Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks) applied to courtroom data. Findings indicate that Neural Networks achieved the highest accuracy (97%) and recall (98%), outperforming traditional biometric and voice-based models, which showed moderate reliability. The study also reveals that while machine learning significantly improves predictive accuracy, challenges of transparency, bias, and ethical implications remain critical. These findings align with theories of technological mediation in legal decision-making, suggesting that AI can enhance but not replace human judgment in credibility assessment. The conclusion emphasises the necessity of explainable AI and ethical safeguards in legal technologies. Recommendations include the adoption of hybrid AI systems, continuous auditing for fairness, and maintaining judicial oversight to ensure justice is not compromised.",

      "abstract": "Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are widely used in medical education to assess students\u2019 clinical and professional skills. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer opportunities to complement human evaluations. This study aims to explore the consistency between human and AI evaluators in assessing medical students\u2019 clinical skills during OSCE. This cross-sectional study was conducted at a state university in Turkey, focusing on pre-clinical medical students (Years 1, 2, and 3). Four clinical skills\u2014intramuscular injection, square knot tying, basic life support, and urinary catheterization\u2014were evaluated during OSCE at the end of the 2023\u20132024 academic year. Video recordings of the students\u2019 performances were assessed by five evaluators: a real-time human assessor, two video-based expert human assessors, and two AI-based systems (ChatGPT-4o and Gemini Flash 1.5). The evaluations were based on standardized checklists validated by the university. Data were collected from 196 students, with sample sizes ranging from 43 to 58 for each skill. Consistency among evaluators was analyzed using statistical methods. AI models consistently assigned higher scores than human evaluators across all skills. For intramuscular injection, the mean total score given by AI was 28.23, while human evaluators averaged 25.25. For knot tying, AI scores averaged 16.07 versus 10.44 for humans. In basic life support, AI scores were 17.05 versus 16.48 for humans. For urinary catheterization, mean scores were similar (AI: 26.68; humans: 27.02), but showed considerable variance in individual criteria. Inter-rater consistency was higher for visually observable steps, while auditory tasks led to greater discrepancies between AI and human evaluators. AI shows promise as a supplemental tool for OSCE evaluation, especially for visually based clinical skills. However, its reliability varies depending on the perceptual demands of the skill being assessed. The higher and more uniform scores given by AI suggest potential for standardization, yet refinement is needed for accurate assessment of skills requiring verbal communication or auditory cues.",

      "abstract": "The scientific discourse surrounding Chronic Lyme Disease (CLD) and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) has evolved over the past twenty-five years into a complex and polarised debate, shaped by shifting research priorities, institutional influences, and competing explanatory models. This study presents the first large-scale, systematic examination of this discourse using an innovative hybrid AI-driven methodology, combining large language models with structured human validation to analyse thousands of scholarly abstracts spanning 25 years. By integrating computational techniques with expert oversight, we developed a quantitative framework for tracking epistemic shifts in contested medical fields, with applications to other content analysis domains. Our analysis revealed a progressive transition from infection-based models of Lyme disease to immune-mediated explanations for persistent symptoms, a shift that has been particularly pronounced in high-impact clinical and immunology journals. At the same time, research supporting CLD has remained largely confined to hypothesis-driven publications, indicating a persistent asymmetry in how competing perspectives are disseminated and legitimised. The investigation into thematic trends further highlighted the enduring complexity of Lyme disease diagnostics and evolving research focus on therapeutic controversies, even as institutional alignment with PTLDS perspectives continues to grow. This study offers new empirical insights into the structural and epistemic forces shaping Lyme disease research, providing a scalable and replicable methodology for analysing discourse. The findings have implications for policymakers, clinicians, and communication strategists, emphasising the need for more equitable research funding, standardised diagnostic criteria, and improved patient-centred care models. This research also underscores the value of AI-assisted methodologies in social science and medical research by systematically quantifying discourse evolution, offering a foundation for future studies examining other contested conditions and controversies.",

Cultural contexts significantly shape individuals\u2019 perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, particularly in the realm of technology acceptance. By adopting a cross-cultural lens, this research explores the potential variations across Chinese and international students from diverse countries in terms of attitudes and their behavioral intentions toward AI use. With a technology acceptance model (TAM) framework, the research used a survey approach, employing questionnaires as the primary means of data collection. The data were then analyzed through structural equation modeling and descriptive statistics. A substantial discrepancy was found in the prevalence, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward AI use between Chinese and international students. Findings further revealed a stronger effect of perceived ease of use on both attitudes and behavioral intentions among international students compared with their Chinese counterparts. Findings suggest that cultural backgrounds and prior technological exposure play intricate roles in shaping perceptions of AI technology. The study emphasizes the need for tailored educational strategies to regulate diverse cultural perspectives, provide language-specific support, and ensure user-friendly interfaces. These insights contribute to the evolving discourse on technology acceptance in higher education and offer practical implications for educators and institutions toward optimizing AI integration in pedagogical practices.",

      "abstract": "Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is a leading cause of vision loss globally. Routine health check-up data\u2014including demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results\u2014are commonly utilized in clinical settings for disease risk assessment. This study aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict RVO risk in the general population using such tabular health data, without requiring coding expertise or retinal imaging. We utilized data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) collected between 2017 and 2020 to develop the RVO prediction model, with external validation performed using independent data from KNHANES 2021. Model construction was conducted using Orange Data Mining, an open-source, code-free, component-based tool with a user-friendly interface, and Google Vertex AI. An easy-to-use oversampling function was employed to address class imbalance, enhancing the usability of the workflow. Various machine learning algorithms were trained by incorporating all features from the health check-up data in the development set. The primary outcome was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for identifying RVO. All machine learning training was completed without the need for coding experience. An artificial neural network (ANN) with a ReLU activation function, developed using Orange Data Mining, demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUC of 0.856 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.835\u20130.875) in internal validation and 0.784 (95% CI, 0.763\u20130.803) in external validation. The ANN outperformed logistic regression and Google Vertex AI models, though differences were not statistically significant in internal validation. In external validation, the ANN showed a marginally significant improvement over logistic regression (P\u2009=\u20090.044), with no significant difference compared to Google Vertex AI. Key predictive variables included age, household income, and blood pressure-related factors. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing an accessible, cost-effective RVO risk prediction tool using health check-up data and no-code machine learning platforms. Such a tool has the potential to enhance early detection and preventive strategies in general healthcare settings, thereby improving patient outcomes.",

In domains where interpretability is crucial, such as medicine and law, standard models often fall short due to their\"black-box\"nature. ICE-T addresses these limitations by using a series of generated prompts that allow an LLM to approach the problem from multiple directions. The responses from the LLM are then converted into numerical feature vectors and processed by a traditional classifier. This method not only maintains high interpretability but also allows for smaller, less capable models to achieve or exceed the performance of larger, more advanced models under zero-shot conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ICE-T across a diverse set of data sources, including medical records and legal documents, consistently surpassing the zero-shot baseline in terms of classification metrics such as F1 scores. Our results indicate that ICE-T can be used for improving both the performance and transparency of AI applications in complex decision-making environments.",

New tools, new collaborators and new creative processes are transforming the way we make, look at and talk about the value of creative work. This shift is widely discussed in Western scholarship. However, there are certain voices still missing from this discussion. These are the voices of the Global Majority, or the Next Billion Users. The perspectives and values found in global digital cultures represent a massive user base of designers, AI ethicists, cultural changemakers, artists, creatives and users whose contribution to this debate could very well represent the next paradigmatic shift in how we approach creativity. Global AI cultures demand our attention. Going forward, media scholars need to diversify and decolonialise approaches to digital creative labour in the Age of AI by drawing attention to the values and creative practices of global digital cultures. This article is structured around six strategic concepts: Recognition, Resituate, Remix, Resistance, Regenerate/Repair and Reimagine. We propose this framework to decenter universality and problematise normativity. These concepts are meant to provoke new associations and patterns of thought, moving us away from pre-conceived notions of what creativity is to adopt new, equitable and diversified notions of creative work.",

      "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education raises significant concerns about algorithmic bias and its impact on equity. This study examines the linkage between teachers' perceptions of AI bias and their concerns for fairness in the classroom while also assessing the influence of teaching level and AI familiarity. Through a cross-sectional survey of 270 educators in Punjab, Pakistan, we utilized quantitative methods, including correlation and regression analysis, to test our hypotheses. Our findings reveal a strong positive association between perceived algorithmic bias and threats to educational equity. We found that school teachers were significantly more aware of AI bias than university faculty. Furthermore, greater teacher familiarity with AI tools correlated with a more nuanced understanding of their potential biases. These results underscore the urgent need to address the \"black box\" nature of educational AI. The study provides empirical evidence that, without careful regulation and comprehensive teacher training, AI-driven tools risk perpetuating and even exacerbating existing educational inequalities, aligning with global concerns about the ethical deployment of AI in sensitive sectors.",

      "abstract": "This paper seeks to explore how contemporary British fiction recontextualizes posthumanist thought when applied to issues of artificial intelligence through narrative speculations about the technology, using Ian McEwan's Machines Like You (2019) and Kazuo Ishiguro's Klara and the Sun (2021). At the convergence of literary criticism, posthumanist theory, and AI ethics, the study questions how the works speak to human exceptionalism, re-theorise subjectivity, and mediate the question of the moral standing of intelligent machines. The analysis will draw on theoretical approaches and arguments expressed by Haraway, Braidotti, and Hayles, as well as philosophical statements on the debate on AI ethics, and apply them through a close reading approach that identifies theme-based convergences and divergences in the narrative structures of the authors. The historical fantasy of McEwan is based on a vision of an alternative past as a politically loaded context that questions agency, empathy, and the end of life. In contrast, Ishiguro's metaphorical sensitivity is a somber meditation on care and memory, a thoughtful victory of a humane consideration of sentient creatures. Their results indicate that the ontological borders between humans and machines are unstable in both texts, as evidenced by the hybrid identities introduced in both pieces that challenge the moral and lawful systems. Moreover, the research indicates that British AI fiction serves as a reconfiguration of the posthumanist discourse, highlighting the interconnection between speculative stories and the need to establish ethical relationships in the development of future technologies. Where the research makes a contribution to the study of cultural implications of AI as an interdisciplinary field of research, it demonstrates the synthesis of literary analysis and philosophical questioning that proposes a relational approach to the ethical implications of AI as a derivative of interdependence between human and nonhuman beings in the form of a technological lifeworld.",

      "abstract": "The growing complexity of construction projects demands decision processes that can integrate diverse professional perspectives across design, cost control, construction, and acceptance. Traditional sequential management approaches often leave conflicts unresolved until late stages, causing delays, cost overruns, and rework. To address this issue, this study develops a cross-stage workflow for construction projects that embeds artificial intelligence into collaborative decision-making. The workflow employs digital agents representing different roles, which engage in structured debates supported by evidence from building information modeling models, engineering drawings, cost records, and technical standards. Through iterative exchanges, alternative solutions are proposed, challenged, and refined, with the process producing decisions that are transparent, traceable, and adaptable to changing project conditions. Results from four representative scenarios confirm significant improvements over conventional practice: unresolved design clashes were reduced by more than 40%, cost forecast deviations narrowed from around 12% to below 5%, schedule variance under disruption decreased by about 18%, and first-pass acceptance rates increased from 74% to 88% with fewer reworks. A longer-term case study further demonstrated reductions in cost variance and project duration, together with higher stakeholder satisfaction. By coupling AI-enabled debate mechanisms with established digital construction environments, the workflow turns disciplinary conflicts into structured reasoning that enhances decision quality. The findings highlight how intelligent and collaborative approaches can deliver measurable gains in cost, time, and quality, while offering a practical pathway for advancing smart construction practices.",

Methods We implemented a literature-validated questionnaire to examine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the target population during the period between April and August 2023. Themes of ethical debate included privacy breaches, consent, ownership, augmented biases, epistemology, and accountability. Participants\u2019 responses were showcased using descriptive statistics and compared between groups using t-test or ANOVA. Results We included 466 participants. The greater majority of respondents were interns and residents (50.2%), followed by medical students (38.0%). Most participants were affiliated with university institutions (62.4%). In terms of privacy, participants acknowledged that Big Data and AI were susceptible to privacy breaches (39.3%); however, 59.0% found such breaches justifiable under certain conditions. For ethical debacles involving informed consent, 41.6% and 44.6% were aware that obtaining informed consent posed an ethical limitation in Big Data and AI applications and denounced the concept of \u201cbroad consent\u201d, respectively. In terms of ownership, 49.6% acknowledged that data cannot be owned yet accepted that institutions could hold a quasi-control of such data (59.0%). Less than 50% of participants were aware of Big Data and AI\u2019s abilities to augment or create new biases in healthcare. Furthermore, participants agreed that researchers, institutions, and legislative bodies were responsible for ensuring the ethical implementation of Big Data and AI. Finally, while demonstrating limited experience with using such technology, participants generally had positive views of the role of Big Data and AI in complementing healthcare. Conclusion Jordanian medical students, physicians in training and senior practitioners have limited awareness of the ethical risks associated with Big Data and AI. Institutions are responsible for raising awareness, especially with the upsurge of such technology.",

In this study, we focused on analyzing biases using ambiguous sentences across English, Malayalam, and Tamil languages. We evaluated the LLMs to see if they associate occupations with commonly held gender stereotypes, by using specific professions within our test sentences. We examined differences between the biases in the three languages in LLMs. Our findings suggested that strong gender biases exist in all the LLMs across the three languages.

Focusing on Generative AI and ChatGPT in particular, our study examines how AI chatbots impact university teachers\u2019 assessment practices, exploring teachers\u2019 perceptions about how ChatGPT performs in response to home examination prompts in undergraduate contexts. University teachers (n\u2009=\u200924) from four different departments in humanities and social sciences participated in Turing Test-inspired experiments, where they blindly assessed student and ChatGPT-written responses to home examination questions. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews in focus groups with the same teachers examining their reflections about the quality of the texts they assessed. Regarding chatbot-generated texts, we found a passing rate range across the cohort (37.5\u2009\u2212\u200985.7%) and a chatbot-written suspicion range (14\u201323%). Regarding the student-written texts, we identified patterns of downgrading, suggesting that teachers were more critical when grading student-written texts. Drawing on post-phenomenology and mediation theory, we discuss AI chatbots as a potentially disruptive technology in higher education practices.",
