      "abstract": "Abstract Digital humanism is an ethics for the digital age that interprets and shapes the process of digital transformation in accordance with the core concepts of humanist philosophy and practice. The core idea of humanist philosophy is human authorship, which is closely linked to the practice of attributing responsibility and, therefore, also with the concepts of reason and freedom. Digital humanism has several different implications: From a theoretical point of view, it means rejecting both the mechanistic paradigm (\u201chumans are machines\u201d) and the animistic paradigm (\u201cmachines are (like) humans\u201d); from a practical point of view, it especially requires us not to attribute responsibility to AI and not to let AI make ethical decisions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Behavior genetics is a controversial science. For decades, scholars have sought to understand the role of heredity in human behavior and life-course outcomes. Recently, technological advances and the rapid expansion of genomic databases have facilitated the discovery of genes associated with human phenotypes such as educational attainment and substance use disorders. To maximize the potential of this flourishing science, and to minimize potential harms, careful analysis of what it would mean for genes to be causes of human behavior is needed. In this paper, we advance a framework for identifying instances of genetic causes, interpreting those causal relationships, and applying them to advance causal knowledge more generally in the social sciences. Central to thinking about genes as causes is counterfactual reasoning, the cornerstone of causal thinking in statistics, medicine, and philosophy. We argue that within-family genetic effects represent the product of a counterfactual comparison in the same way as average treatment effects (ATEs) from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Both ATEs from RCTs and within-family genetic effects are shallow causes: They operate within intricate causal systems ( non-unitary ), produce heterogeneous effects across individuals ( non-uniform ), and are not mechanistically informative ( non-explanatory ). Despite these limitations, shallow causal knowledge can be used to improve understanding of the etiology of human behavior and to explore sources of heterogeneity and fade-out in treatment effects.",

We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability re- search is a principled approach to understanding models be- cause neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI\u2019s inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.",

In this article we\\nreview explainable machine learning in view of applications in the natural\\nsciences and discuss three core elements which we identified as relevant in\\nthis context: transparency, interpretability, and explainability. With respect\\nto these core elements, we provide a survey of recent scientific works that\\nincorporate machine learning and the way that explainable machine learning is\\nused in combination with domain knowledge from the application areas.\\n",

      "abstract": "Objective To develop an evidence\u2010based guideline for the comprehensive management of osteoarthritis ( OA ) as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) and the Arthritis Foundation, updating the 2012 ACR recommendations for the management of hand, hip, and knee OA . Methods We identified clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes questions and critical outcomes in OA . A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available educational, behavioral, psychosocial, physical, mind\u2010body, and pharmacologic therapies for OA . Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A Voting Panel, including rheumatologists, an internist, physical and occupational therapists, and patients, achieved consensus on the recommendations. Results Based on the available evidence, either strong or conditional recommendations were made for or against the approaches evaluated. Strong recommendations were made for exercise, weight loss in patients with knee and/or hip OA who are overweight or obese, self\u2010efficacy and self\u2010management programs, tai chi, cane use, hand orthoses for first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint OA , tibiofemoral bracing for tibiofemoral knee OA , topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) for knee OA , oral NSAID s, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for knee OA . Conditional recommendations were made for balance exercises, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, kinesiotaping for first CMC OA , orthoses for hand joints other than the first CMC joint, patellofemoral bracing for patellofemoral knee OA , acupuncture, thermal modalities, radiofrequency ablation for knee OA , topical NSAID s, intraarticular steroid injections and chondroitin sulfate for hand OA , topical capsaicin for knee OA , acetaminophen, duloxetine, and tramadol. Conclusion This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for the management of OA . Clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision\u2010making that accounts for patients\u2019 values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

We argue for the Explanatory View Hypothesis: that Mechanistic Interpretability research is a principled approach to understanding models because neural networks contain implicit explanations which can be extracted and understood. We hence show that Explanatory Faithfulness, an assessment of how well an explanation fits a model, is well-defined. We propose a definition of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) as the practice of producing Model-level, Ontic, Causal-Mechanistic, and Falsifiable explanations of neural networks, allowing us to distinguish MI from other interpretability paradigms and detail MI's inherent limits. We formulate the Principle of Explanatory Optimism, a conjecture which we argue is a necessary precondition for the success of Mechanistic Interpretability.",

Recent experiments applying deep learning to rainfall\u2010runoff simulation indicate that there is significantly more information in large\u2010scale hydrological data sets than hydrologists have been able to translate into theory or models. While there is a growing interest in machine learning in the hydrological sciences community, in many ways, our community still holds deeply subjective and nonevidence\u2010based preferences for models based on a certain type of \u201cprocess understanding\u201d that has historically not translated into accurate theory, models, or predictions. This commentary is a call to action for the hydrology community to focus on developing a quantitative understanding of where and when hydrological process understanding is valuable in a modeling discipline increasingly dominated by machine learning. We offer some potential perspectives and preliminary examples about how this might be accomplished.",

      "abstract": "Objective To develop an evidence\u2010based guideline for the comprehensive management of osteoarthritis ( OA ) as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) and the Arthritis Foundation, updating the 2012 ACR recommendations for the management of hand, hip, and knee OA . Methods We identified clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes questions and critical outcomes in OA . A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available educational, behavioral, psychosocial, physical, mind\u2010body, and pharmacologic therapies for OA . Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A Voting Panel, including rheumatologists, an internist, physical and occupational therapists, and patients, achieved consensus on the recommendations. Results Based on the available evidence, either strong or conditional recommendations were made for or against the approaches evaluated. Strong recommendations were made for exercise, weight loss in patients with knee and/or hip OA who are overweight or obese, self\u2010efficacy and self\u2010management programs, tai chi, cane use, hand orthoses for first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint OA , tibiofemoral bracing for tibiofemoral knee OA , topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) for knee OA , oral NSAID s, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for knee OA . Conditional recommendations were made for balance exercises, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, kinesiotaping for first CMC OA , orthoses for hand joints other than the first CMC joint, patellofemoral bracing for patellofemoral knee OA , acupuncture, thermal modalities, radiofrequency ablation for knee OA , topical NSAID s, intraarticular steroid injections and chondroitin sulfate for hand OA , topical capsaicin for knee OA , acetaminophen, duloxetine, and tramadol. Conclusion This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for the management of OA . Clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision\u2010making that accounts for patients\u2019 values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.",

At its center is the question of which cognitive capacities should be included in the ontology of cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience. One common strategy for answering this question is to look at brain structures and determine the cognitive capacities for which they are responsible. Some authors interpret this strategy as a search for neural mechanisms , as understood by the so-called new mechanistic approach . In this article, I will show that this new mechanistic answer is confronted with what I call the triviality problem . A discussion of this problem will show that one cannot derive a meaningful cognitive ontology from neural mechanisms alone. Nonetheless, neural mechanisms play a crucial role in the discovery of a cognitive ontology because they are epistemic proxies for best systematizations .",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disordered eating can underpin a number of debilitating and prevalent chronic diseases, such as obesity. Broader advances in psychopharmacology and biology have motivated some neuroscientists to address diet-induced obesity through reductionist, pre-clinical eating investigations on the rodent brain. Specifically, chemogenetic and optogenetic methods developed in the 21st century allow neuroscientists to perform in vivo , region-specific/projection-specific/promoter-specific circuit manipulations and immediately assess the impact of these manipulations on rodent feeding. These studies are able to rigorously conclude whether a specific neuronal population regulates feeding behaviour in the hope of eventually developing a mechanistic neuroanatomical map of appetite regulation. However, an artificially stimulated/inhibited rodent neuronal population that changes feeding behaviour does not necessarily represent a pharmacological target for treating eating disorders in humans. Chemogenetic/optogenetic findings must therefore be triangulated with the array of theories that contribute to our understanding of appetite. The objective of this review is to provide a wide-ranging discussion of the limitations of chemogenetic/optogenetic circuit manipulation experiments in rodents that are used to investigate appetite. Stepping into and outside of medical science epistemologies, this paper draws on philosophy of science, nutrition, addiction biology and neurophilosophy to prompt more integrative, transdisciplinary interpretations of chemogenetic/optogenetic appetite data. Through discussing the various technical and epistemological limitations of these data, we provide both an overview of chemogenetics and optogenetics accessible to non-neuroscientist obesity researchers, as well as a resource for neuroscientists to expand the number of lenses through which they interpret their circuit manipulation findings.",

      "abstract": "In an era of corporatized health care systems, increasingly overseen by strategic operations specialists and risk managers, nurses are struggling to maintain practice environments within which their nursing intelligence, applied to the unique and distinctive needs of each patient and situation, can be enacted. It has been well recognized that significant changes in the complex forces shaping nursing practice throughout the second half of the 20th century have led to a significant reduction in tolerance for self-regulation and a widespread uptake of expanded external controls. According to McIntyre, Burton and Holmes, as our care organizations are increasingly corporatized, with leadership interpreted as operations oversight rather than professional management, and augmented by the additional mechanistic influence of electronic record keeping systems, we are \"effectively erasing the creativity, judgement and indeed the very humanity that has necessarily and iteratively shaped the construct of professional nursing\" (McIntyre et al., 2020, p. 7). It is important that nurses understand that these trends did not simply happen as a natural evolution of health care growth and development, but have actually been part of a grand design to make health care delivery systems more efficient and effective, to reduce wastage and error, and to benefit from what can be learned from the standardizing mechanisms and processes that have demonstrably advantaged the industrial sector. Systems such as \"lean management,\" borrowed from automobile manufacturing and applied to health care, provide a management philosophy that includes powerful tools for enforcing accountability structures to help systems work relentlessly toward those goals (Kim et al., 2006). Proponents of lean management explicitly seek to dismantle what they consider to be cultural and practical barriers to efficiency within a health care organization. On the practical front, they see the \"silo mentality\" of the individual health care professions to be a structural impediment; they therefore strongly advocate for mechanisms that break down systems of nursing leadership in favor of interprofessional interchangeability across clinical programs and organizational functions. On the cultural front, they recognize the idea of individualized care (i.e., \"each patient is unique\") as a central ideological flaw that requires vigilent surveillance and emphatic disruption (Kim et al., 2006). These kinds of management philosophies have often been described as contributing to the \"McDonaldization\" (Ritzer, 1993) of nursing, in that they seek to create the conditions that enforce standardized solutions to what workers do across all settings, contexts, and patient situations (Bradshaw, 2016; Norlyk et al., 2017). Standardization makes processes and systems much easier to discipline and control, thereby creating the impression of evidence-based practice and accountability. That these corporate management philosophies have been most forcefully applied toward nursing in particular is not, therefore, surprising. Not only do nurses constitute the largest health care workforce, but they are also notoriously resistant to standardizing processes, given their epistemological hardwiring to see patients as distinctive individuals with unmet needs. Further, they are significantly less likely than other disciplines to have appropriate representation at senior health care governance tables and within corporate management structures (Prybil, 2013). Thus it is inevitable that systems of nursing will be the hardest-hit by widespread uptake and implementation of these modern health care management philosophies and practices (Rankin & Campbell, 2006). As many nurses at the point-of-care have noticed, the most obvious manifestation of modern management philosophies is the rapid proliferation of standard protocols, practice guidelines, and reporting requirements that govern an increasing array of their everyday practice activities. Their compliance with these policies and protocols becomes the driving focus of operations managers who, increasingly, are not themselves nurses and may have little understanding of or sympathy for a nursing perspective on what constitutes good care. From their perspective, good care is adherence to standard routines and protocols, not the work of meeting patient needs. Nurses therefore feel disciplined and controlled beyond the point of being able to make independent decisions on behalf of their patients\u2014to enact the intelligence and expertise that their profession stands for. As Austin (2011) explained, this changes the nature of nursing from a moral practice to a routinized activity. \"Seeing suffering while being unable to respond with true compassion, running around meeting targets, delivering 'very good' customer service leaves nurses disoriented. They lose their moral bearings and their self-identification 'nurse' ceases to have meaning\" (p. 164). Thus, she explains, such operational governance is incommensurate with nursing conceived as a moral practice. While COVID-19 has demonstrated to the world the value of humane and compassionate nursing action, even in the most extreme of care contexts, we have not yet been able to effectively mount the argument that our health systems will serve our populations better when nurses are supported in exerting an appropriate amount of control over their practice. Within nursing, it seems patently self-evident why an empowered and actively engaged nursing workforce, supported by strong and astute nursing leadership, significantly improves the likelihood of safe and effective patient care (Murray et al., 2018). [We also know why the opposite is true\u2014that a demoralized and disempowered nursing work force is more likely to create the conditions for poor care (Bradshaw, 2016)]. However, we must find ways to pitch that logic against corporate managerial philosophies that are dedicated to a strategic mission of disarming and dismantling us. Nursing Inquiry readers are among those inclined to be critically curious about the unintended effects of tightening control, circumscribing practice and reducing the inherent complexity of our profession's unique contribution to that which can be captured in a task list. As this trend escalates, we believe we have an increasing imperative to offer a strong countervailing force to the \"task fraternity\" by creating the kinds of thoughtful and critical conversations that engage nurses in the worlds of theorizing, philosophizing, and critical deconstruction. (Thorne et al., 2012, p. 189) It does not seem as if we have made much progress on that front, and perhaps we have slipped behind. However, I still believe that our Nursing Inquiry community contains the wisdom and scholarly capacity to sustain the critique and press for change. Within the pages of this journal, I am confident that we can continue to support and champion those scholars who concern themselves with critical reflection on these global trends, and who remain persistently optimistic that, together, we can do something to turn the tides. Nurses have never just given up and declared defeat. And now is not the time to begin.",

      "abstract": "This Article examines how the metaphors in judicial opinions reveal judicial theories of lawmaking and judicial philosophies. It does so through a close reading of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s majority opinion and Justice Gorsuch\u2019s dissenting opinion in Artis v. District of Columbia, 138 S. Ct. 594 (2018). Artis was about what the phrase \u201cshall be tolled\u201d means in the federal supplemental jurisdiction statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367. Does it pause the statute of limitations while a state-law claim is in federal court or keep it running? In holding that Congress used \u201cstop the clock\u201d tolling, an \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d legal device that pauses the statute of limitations, Justice Ginsburg\u2019s majority opinion uses conventional, mechanistic metaphors. Justice Gorsuch\u2019s dissent uses more elaborate, agrarian metaphors to argue that Congress used a stricter \u201cgrace period\u201d version of tolling because \u201c[w]hen Congress replants the roots of preexisting law in the federal code, this Court assumes it brings with it the surrounding soil.\u201d This Article shows that Justice Ginsburg\u2019s mechanistic metaphors describe lawmaking like engineering and bespeak a mode of judicial interpretation based on purpose and precedent\u2014while Justice Gorsuch\u2019s agrarian metaphors hark back to a pastoral conception of lawmaking and interpretation \u201crooted\u201d in a mythical common-law history and tradition. It then compares Justice Ginsburg\u2019s moreunderstated use of conventional metaphors to Justice Gorsuch\u2019s more performative metaphorical technique, arguing that their different rhetorical strategies reflect their different visions of lawmaking and interpretive philosophies. And it closes by showing how close attention to the metaphors theyuse can reveal the flaws in each approach.",

A potential solution is the additional integration of prior knowledge into the training process which leads to the notion of informed machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches in this field. We provide a definition and propose a concept for informed machine learning which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional machine learning. We introduce a taxonomy that serves as a classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. Based on this taxonomy, we survey related research and describe how different knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The current diagnostic practices are linked to a 20-fold increase in the reported prevalence of ASD over the last 30 years. Fragmenting the autism phenotype into dimensional \u201cautistic traits\u201d results in the alleged recognition of autism-like symptoms in any psychiatric or neurodevelopemental condition and in individuals decreasingly distant from the typical population, and prematurely dismisses the relevance of a diagnostic threshold. Non-specific socio-communicative and repetitive DSM 5 criteria, combined with four quantitative specifiers as well as all their possible combinations, render limitless variety of presentations consistent with the categorical diagnosis of ASD. We propose several remedies to this problem: maintain a line of research on prototypical autism; limit the heterogeneity compatible with a categorical diagnosis to situations with a phenotypic overlap and a validated etiological link with prototypical autism; reintroduce the qualitative properties of autism presentations and of current dimensional specifiers, language, intelligence, comorbidity, and severity in the criteria used to diagnose autism in replacement of quantitative \u201csocial\u201d and \u201crepetitive\u201d criteria; use these qualitative features combined with the clinical intuition of experts and machine-learning algorithms to differentiate coherent subgroups in today\u2019s autism spectrum; study these subgroups separately, and then compare them; and question the autistic nature of \u201cautistic traits\u201d",

Although anthropogenic land use change is known to be the major driver of zoonotic pathogen spillover from wildlife to human populations, the scientific underpinnings of land use-induced zoonotic spillover have rarely been investigated from the landscape perspective. We call for interdisciplinary collaborations to advance knowledge on land use implications for zoonotic disease emergence with a view toward informing the decisions needed to protect human health. In particular, we urge a mechanistic focus on the zoonotic pathogen infect-shed-spill-spread cascade to enable protection of landscape immunity-the ecological conditions that reduce the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir hosts-as a conservation and biosecurity priority. Results are urgently needed to formulate an integrated, holistic set of science-based policy and management measures that effectively and cost-efficiently minimise zoonotic disease risk. We consider opportunities to better institute the necessary scientific collaboration, address primary technical challenges, and advance policy and management issues that warrant particular attention to effectively address health security from local to global scales.",

For this reason,&#13;\\narticles and reviews that present taxonomies of XAI methods seem&#13;\\nto be a welcomed way to get an overview of the field. Building on&#13;\\nthis idea, there is currently a trend of producing such taxonomies,&#13;\\nleading to several competing approaches to construct them. In this&#13;\\npaper, we will review recent approaches to constructing taxonomies&#13;\\nof XAI methods and discuss general challenges concerning them as&#13;\\nwell as their individual advantages and limitations. Our review is&#13;\\nintended to help scholars be aware of challenges current taxonomies&#13;\\nface. As we will argue, when charting the field of XAI, it may not&#13;\\nbe sufficient to rely on one of the approaches we found. To amend&#13;\\nthis problem, we will propose and discuss three possible solutions:&#13;\\na new taxonomy that incorporates the reviewed ones, a database of&#13;\\nXAI methods, and a decision tree to help choose fitting methods.",

Here, we systematically assess the mitigation potential of demand-side options categorized into avoid, shift and improve, and their human well-being links. We show that these options, bridging socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological domains, can reduce counterfactual sectoral emissions by 40\u201380% in end-use sectors. Based on expert judgement and an extensive literature database, we evaluate 306 combinations of well-being outcomes and demand-side options, finding largely beneficial effects in improvement in well-being (79% positive, 18% neutral and 3% negative), even though we find low confidence on the social dimensions of well-being. Implementing such nuanced solutions is based axiomatically on an understanding of malleable rather than fixed preferences, and procedurally on changing infrastructures and choice architectures. Results demonstrate the high mitigation potential of demand-side mitigation options that are synergistic with well-being.",

Some philosophers have suggested treating opaque systems instrumentally, but computer scientists developing strategies for increasing transparency are correct in finding this unsatisfying. Instead, I propose an analysis of transparency as having three forms: transparency of the algorithm, the realization of the algorithm in code, and the way that code is run on particular hardware and data. This targets the transparency most useful for a task, avoiding instrumentalism by providing partial transparency when full transparency is impossible.",

Within a study, multiple observations are combined by averaging, or as factors in a likelihood or prediction algorithm. In multilevel modeling or Bayesian analysis, population or prior information is combined with data using the weighted averaging derived from probability modeling. In a scientific research project, inferences from data analysis are interpreted in light of mechanistic models and substantive theories. Within a scholarly or applied research community, data and conclusions from separate laboratories are amalgamated through a series of steps, including peer review, meta-analysis, review articles, and replication studies. These issues have been discussed for many years in the philosophy of science and statistics, gaining attention in recent decades first with the renewed popularity of Bayesian inference and then with concerns about the replication crisis in science. In this article, we review the amalgamation of statistical evidence from different perspectives, connecting the foundations of statistics to the social processes of validation, criticism, and consensus building.",

The focus is mainly on Multiple Linear Regression, particularly Ordinary Least Squares, using a Genetic Algorithm for variable selection from various theoretical molecular descriptors, but the comments can be useful also for other QSAR methods. The need for rigorous validation, also external, and for applicability domain check to guarantee predictivity and reliability of QSAR models is particularly highlighted. The commented approach is the \u201cpredictive\u201d one, based on chemometrics, and is usefully applied to the prioritization of environmental pollutants. All the discussed points and the author's ideas are implemented in the software QSARINS, as a legacy to the QSAR community.",

Here, we propose the predictive processing framework for brain function as a promising candidate for providing this systematic foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework\u2019s ability to address three general challenges to identifying the neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two constraints common to many theories of consciousness. Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed, systematic mappings between neural substrates and phenomenological structure. We conclude that the predictive processing framework, precisely because it at the outset is not itself a theory of consciousness, has significant potential for advancing the neuroscience of consciousness.",

      "abstract": "Across the spectrum of industrial sectors, including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, personal care products, food additives and their associated regulatory agencies, there is a need to develop robust and reliable methods to reduce or replace animal testing. It is generally recognised that no single alternative method will be able to provide a one-to-one replacement for assays based on more complex toxicological endpoints. Hence, information from a combination of techniques is required. A greater understanding of the time and concentration-dependent mechanisms, underlying the interactions between chemicals and biological systems, and the sequence of events that can lead to apical effects, will help to move forward the science of reducing and replacing animal experiments. In silico modelling, in vitro assays, high-throughput screening, organ-on-a-chip technology, omics and mathematical biology, can provide complementary information to develop a complete picture of the potential response of an organism to a chemical stressor. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and systems biology frameworks enable relevant information from diverse sources to be logically integrated. While individual researchers do not need to be experts across all disciplines, it is useful to have a fundamental understanding of what other areas of science have to offer, and how knowledge can be integrated with other disciplines. The purpose of this review is to provide those who are unfamiliar with predictive in silico tools, with a fundamental understanding of the underlying theory. Current applications, software, barriers to acceptance, new developments and the use of integrated approaches are all discussed, with additional resources being signposted for each of the topics.",
