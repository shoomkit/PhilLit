All articles are available for free download on the open web. Often research findings are available on arXiv before they are published in a peer-reviewed journal. arXiv relies on a collaborative support business model where institutions that most heavily\n utilize arXiv contribute financially. Support also comes from Cornell University and the Simons Foundation.",
