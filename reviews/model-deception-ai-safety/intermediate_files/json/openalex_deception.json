      "abstract": "Abstract Conversation is often cast as a cooperative effort, and some aspects of it, such as implicatures, have been claimed to depend on an assumption of cooperation (Grice, 1989). But any systematic class of inference derived from assumptions of cooperation, such as implicatures, could also be, on occasion, used to deceive listeners strategically. Here, we explore the extent to which speakers might choose different kinds of implicature triggers in an uncooperative game of communication. Concretely, we present a study in the form of a cooperative or competitive signaling game where communicators can exploit three kinds of implicatures: exact reading of numeral expressions, scalar implicatures linked to the quantifier some and ad hoc scalar implicatures. We compare how these implicatures are used depending on whether the participants' co\u2010player is cooperative, a strategic opponent, or a non\u2010strategic opponent. We find that when the strategy of the co\u2010player is clear to the participants, the three types of implicatures are used to exploit the co\u2010player's interpretation strategy. Indeed, participants use numeral implicatures as reliably as truth conditional content in all three conditions, while scalar quantifiers and ad hoc implicature elicit different strategies. We interpret these findings as evidence that speakers expect their interlocutors to infer implicatures from their utterances even in contexts where they know that they will be perceived as uncooperative.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Lying is a deliberate attempt to transmit messages that mislead others. Analysis of language behaviors holds great promise as an objective method of detecting deception. The current study reports on the frequency of use and acoustic nature of \u201cum\u201d and \u201clike\u201d during laboratory-elicited lying versus truth-telling. Results obtained using a within-participants false opinion paradigm showed that instances of \u201cum\u201d occur less frequently and are of shorter duration during lying compared to truth-telling. There were no significant differences in relation to \u201clike.\u201d These findings contribute to our understanding of the linguistic markers of deception behavior. They also assist in our understanding of the role of \u201cum\u201d in communication more generally. Our results suggest that \u201cum\u201d may not be accurately conceptualized as a filled pause/hesitation or speech disfluency/error whose increased usage coincides with increased cognitive load or increased arousal during lying. It may instead carry a lexical status similar to interjections and form an important part of authentic, effortless communication, which is somewhat lacking during lying.",

While there is a consensus view that providing false information is not permitted, there are also \u201cgray areas\u201d with respect to practices that omit information or are misleading without an explicit lie being told. In this paper, we report the results of a large survey among experimental economists and students concerning various specific gray areas. We find that there is substantial heterogeneity across respondent choices. The data indicate a perception that costs and benefits matter, so that such practices might in fact be appropriate when the topic is important and there is no other way to gather data. Compared to researchers, students have different attitudes about some of the methods in the specific scenarios that we ask about. Few students express awareness of the no-deception policy at their schools. We also briefly discuss some potential alternatives to \u201cgray-area\u201d deception, primarily based on suggestions offered by respondents.",

      "abstract": "Although lying is an action which is fundamental for human communication, there are not many analyses that treat lying from a linguistic point of view. This paper treats lying on the background of recent discussions of the semantics-pragmatics interface. On the one hand, lying has to do with truth and falsehood; since these are semantic notions, there is a semantic side of lying. On the other hand, lying has to do with the speech act of assertion, and this is a genuine pragmatic notion. Semantic and pragmatic aspects go into a proper definition of lying as proposed in this paper. On the basis of typical scenarios it is shown how lying may be distinguished from deception and misleading. It is argued that lying is an act of verbal deception; however, deception has not to be implemented into the definition of lying as a separate condition. This line of argument runs against recent approaches in the philosophy of language (cf. Carson 2010) that defend the view that lying does not include deception. Furthermore, at least some cases of misleading in the sense of Saul (2012) may be analysed as cases of untruthful implicatures. The latter are considered as a part of the total act of lying (see Meibauer 2005, Meibauer 2011, Meibauer 2014a, Meibauer 2014b, and Meibauer 2014c). In the course of this paper further acts such as so-called bald-faced lies, selfless assertions, and bullshitting are discussed and related to the overall topic of lying.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An important moral category\u2014dishonest speech\u2014has been overlooked in theoretical ethics despite its importance in legal, political, and everyday social exchanges. Discussion in this area has instead been fixated on a binary debate over the contrast between lying and \u2018merely misleading\u2019 (that is, attempting to deceive someone without uttering a literal falsehood). Some see lying as a distinctive wrong; others see it as morally equivalent to deliberately omitting relevant truths, falsely insinuating, or any other species of attempted verbal deception. Parties to this debate have missed the relevance to their disagreement of the notion of communicative dishonesty. Communicative dishonesty need not take the form of a lie, yet its wrongness does not reduce to the wrongness of seeking to deceive. This paper therefore proposes a major shift of attention away from the lying/misleading debate and towards the topic of communicative dishonesty (or \u2018dishonesty\u2019 for short). Dishonesty is not a simple notion to define, however. It presupposes a difficult distinction between what is and is not expressed in a given utterance. This differs from the more familiar distinction between what is and is not said, the distinction at the heart of the lying/misleading debate. This paper uses an idea central to speech act theory to characterize dishonesty in terms of the utterer\u2019s communicative intentions, and applies the resulting definition to a variety of contexts.",

      "abstract": "In modern practice, doctors who outright lie to their patients are often condemned, yet those who employ non-lying deceptions tend to be judged less critically. Some areas of non-disclosure have recently been challenged: not telling patients about resuscitation decisions; inadequately informing patients about risks of alternative procedures and withholding information about medical errors. Despite this, there remain many areas of clinical practice where non-disclosures of information are accepted, where lies about such information would not be. Using illustrative hypothetical situations, all based on common clinical practice, we explore the extent to which we should consider other deceptive practices in medicine to be morally equivalent to lying. We suggest that there is no significant moral difference between lying to a patient and intentionally withholding relevant information: non-disclosures could be subjected to Bok's 'Test of Publicity' to assess permissibility in the same way that lies are. The moral equivalence of lying and relevant non-disclosure is particularly compelling when the agent's motivations, and the consequences of the actions (from the patient's perspectives), are the same. We conclude that it is arbitrary to claim that there is anything inherently worse about lying to a patient to mislead them than intentionally deceiving them using other methods, such as euphemism or non-disclosure. We should question our intuition that non-lying deceptive practices in clinical practice are more permissible and should thus subject non-disclosures to the same scrutiny we afford to lies.",

I argue that there is a limited range of reasonable views about the definition of lying and defend the following claims on which all of the reasonable definitions agree: A necessary condition for telling a lie is that one makes a statement or assertion that is insincere, namely, a statement that one believes to be false or doesn't believe to be true. (One can't lie unless one makes an insincere statement.) A sufficient condition for telling a lie is that one makes a statement that: a. is false, b. one believes is false, c. one makes with the intention to deceive others, and d. one makes in a context in which one implicitly or explicitly assures others that what one says is true. (Any statement that satisfies conditions a-d is a lie.) I explain the differences between lying, deception, and withholding information and propose a distinction between misleading and deceiving. Then I explain Frankfurt's concept of bullshit (which involves indifference to the truth of one's statements), the concepts of spin and partial truths, and the distinction between the truth and truthfulness of statements. I conclude by discussing two other important concepts: preventing people from acquiring true beliefs and undermining knowledge and trust in reliable sources of information.",

      "abstract": "... All warfare is the way (Tao) of deception. Therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active, inactivity. When near, make it appear that you are far away; when far away, that you are near. Offer the enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike him... Sun Tzu. The concept of strategic deception is not new in strategy and can be traced to early writings of Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, and Aristotle, among others. Over time, classic stratagems that had military and political origins have found their way into strategic management concepts. The term strategy is derived from strategos, a Greek term used to describe a military commander during the Hellenistic times that marked the zenith of Greek influence around the Mediterranean region. Bracket (1980) offers meaningful insight into the Greek verb stratego: a plan to destroy one's enemies through effective use of resources. Many terminologies in the corporate environment such as feints and guerilla tactics remind one of the similarities between military strategy and business. This romanticized view of strategy, is evident in the way strategy studies have treated the exploits of Sun Tzu, Hannibal, Machiavelli, and the Normandy invasion, among others. The writings of Sun Tzu are an important reading in many business schools while a whole stream of organizational research is devoted on Machiavelli. Despite the rich anecdotal evidence of strategic deception in business, there are many gaps to be filled by the research. Scholars have hypothesized on different dimensions of strategic deception such as feints, bluffs, gambits, and curveballs (Carr, 1968; McGrath et al., 1998; Hendricks and McAfee, 2006; Stalk, 2006) based on descriptive, game-theoretic or signaling theory. Tiffs paper identifies gaps in the existing knowledge of strategic deception literature, and suggests promising directions for future research. Areas that have not been addressed in the literature include the integration of existing perspectives on deception, evaluating key variables that affect deception and contexts that lead to deception. A contextual framework for deception has been developed. Deception is framed in a context of uncertainty, while the rationale for deception is described from a transaction cost perspective. The paper also highlights the role of strategic leaders as key players in the decision-making process. Ultimately, deception has wider unintended implications that are discussed. Strategic deception refers to strategic actions aimed at misleading rivals from the true strategic intent of the firm or the environment. The extent and nature of deception may vary from simple concealment of trivial information to outright lies and disinformation. Consequently, deceptive strategies may range from perfectly legal competitive strategies to illegal practices of lying to gain an advantage. While the interest here is to examine realistic conditions that lead to strategic deception in competitive environments, the concern in this paper is not to delve into the ethics of deception. Senior corporate executives are responsible for strategic decisions within their firms, including strategic deception. From the strategic leadership literature, key firm executives have significant influence over firm strategies and organizations and the strategies they adapt are a reflection of those executives (Hambrick and Mason, 1984; Boal and Hooijberg, 2000; Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1996). It is these senior corporate executives that make deceptive strategic choices. Consequently, the firm's strategic choices can be better understood by evaluating top executives' behavioral orientations, decision-making processes, and organizational context. CEOs are motivated to make strategic choices on the basis of many variables. Evaluating the context and CEO's behavioral orientations helps shed more light on how deceptive strategies emerge in the decision-making process. The current competitive environment is characterized by uncertainty that has been compounded by the state of the global environment. \u2026",

To be effective, observers must also be able to infer the person's thoughts and feelings about what he or she is looking at, but this has only rarely been investigated in laboratory studies. In this study, participants' eye movements were recorded while they chose which of four patterns they preferred. New observers were subsequently able to reliably guess the preference response by watching a replay of the fixations. Moreover, when asked to mislead the person guessing, participants changed their looking behavior and guessing success was reduced. In a second experiment, na\u00efve participants could also guess the preference of the original observers but were unable to identify trials which were lies.

Such processes of organizational decoupling may in turn threaten corporate legitimacy. Therefore this article explores public acceptance of deceptive corporate practices that range between the poles of veracity and lying: They involve half-truths and concealment but no blatant lies and they neglect veracity only to conform to conflicting ethical values. The analysis builds on the assumption that specific types of corporate deception fulfill protective functions, such as privacy protection, self-defense, and social cohesion, and are therefore socially accepted. Results from an experimental online survey (n = 1,417) indicate that protective functions are ascribed to corporate deception, yet participants show only moderate levels of acceptance and advocacy on behalf of the corporation. Corporate deception is most likely to be perceived as legitimate when it serves privacy protection and when it involves altruistic intentions. These findings point out limits of organizational decoupling and emphasize the need for pluralistic ethics in strategic communication that provide a framework for the resolution of ethical dilemmas under consideration of situational conditions.",

      "abstract": "Self-deception cuts across the behavior of persons, organizations, and states. Self-deception amounts to wearing a weightless mask: While the wearer is unaware of it, spectators usually recognize it. As soon as the wearer becomes conscious of the weightless mask, self-deception ceases to exist. This gives rise to a paradox: How could it ever be possible for the person to succeed in hiding the weightless mask from his or her own conscious self? To solve the paradox, this paper proposes that self-deception involves \u201ctwo structural choices\u201d: 1) an agent identifies the optimal decision \u2014 but the agent may fail (as a result of temptation) to choose it, which gives rise to self-blame; 2)\u00a0The agent under focus may choose to invent a misleader (a lie) to make the choice appear \u201cas if\u201d it were optimal in order to avoid self-blame. The quest for a blameless choice makes it possible for the person to succeed in hiding the weightless mask from the conscious self. Aside from solving the Self-Deception Paradox, the proposed two-structural choice theory sheds light on three kinds of self-deception: red herring, self-rationalization, and denial.",

We critique two of Cohen and Shapiro's primary arguments. First, Cohen and Shapiro argue that offering undisclosed placebos is not lying to the patient, but rather is making a self-fulfilling prophecy--telling a \"lie\" that, ideally, will become true. We argue that offering undisclosed placebos is not a \"lie\" but is a straightforward case of deceptively misleading the patient. Second, Cohen and Shapiro argue that offering undisclosed CPTs is not equivocation. We argue that it typically is equivocation or deception of another sort. If justifiable, undisclosed placebo use will have to be justified as a practice that is deceptive in most instances.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the issue of lying from a semiotic perspective and its specific aim is the analysis of the theory of the lie as conceived by Aurelius Augustinus, bishop of Hippo (354\u2013430 A.D.), also known as Augustine or St. Augustine. The latter devoted two short treatises to the issue of lying: De mendacio (On lying) and Contra mendacium (Against lying), written in ca. 395 DC and 420 DC, respectively. The paper will focus on duplicity and intention to deceive as fundamental and necessary features of the lie. Augustine\u2019s chief contribution to the study of human deception was to have severed the assessment of what is a lie from factual falsity. For Augustine, at the kernel of the notion of lying lies the idea of intentionality. Following this line of thought, the paper singles out two types of intentionality, namely the intention to assert a falsehood and the intention to mislead. On the basis of this double nature of intentionality, the present paper seeks to outline a theoretical framework for the study of species of falsehoods. The outcome is a typology of untruthfulness that envisages a fourfold inventory of falsehoods based on the difference between jokes, errors, lies and pretences.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic: an overabundance of information, some accurate and some not. At this pandemic we have seen a large scale of fake news and misinformation, leading to anti-vaccine, anti-mask, and anti-5G protests.1 Fake news is intentionally misleading and deceptive news that is written and published with the intent to damage an entity or a person. They may contain false, misleading, imposter, manipulated or fabricated content. Much of the discourse on fake news conflates three notions, named \"information disorders\": (a) Misinformation: false information someone shares without knowing it's untrue, (b) Disinformation: false information that's shared with the intention to harm or mislead, and (c) Malinformation: true information that's used to harm others.2 False beliefs generally arise through the same mechanisms that establish accurate beliefs. People appear to encode all new information as if it were true and later tag the information as being either true or false. Different cognitive, social and affective factors lead people to form or endorse misinformed views. The emotional content of the information shared also affects false-belief formation. An angry mood can boost misinformation sharing, while social exclusion, which is likely to induce a negative mood, can increase susceptibility to conspiratorial content.3 As shown by the Illusory Truth Effect, repeated exposure to an article, whether real or fake, increases people's perceptions of its accuracy. In social media, falsehood seems to diffuse significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects are more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, and science. Moreover, although prior knowledge of a statement leads people to confirm the statement the next time, they see it (confirmation bias), novelty facilitates decision making since it updates our understanding of the world.4 The fitness value of accurate information seems so obvious, while self-deception seems to threaten such hard-won informational gains. Then, why has not it selected out? The American evolutionary biologist and sociobiologist Robert Trivers5 suggested that although our senses have evolved to give us an exquisitely detailed perception of the outside world, as soon as that information hits our brains, it often becomes biased and distorted, usually without conscious effort. Why should this be so? For Trivers, the evolutionary origins of the human propensity for self-deception lie in the adaptive benefits of deceiving others. An animal becomes a better liar when it believes its own lies, or we deceive ourselves the better to deceive others. Deception in animals is the transmission of misinformation by one animal to another, and natural selection favors deceptive signaling when aggression either confers a great benefit to signalers or imposes a great cost to receivers.6 In humans, self-deception process may have a protective role against depression, while depression on its own may reduce mechanisms of self-deception.7, 8 Humans are biased information-seekers that prefer to receive information that confirms their values and worldviews. Maybe, this is why myths and conspiracy theories around COVID-19 and vaccines exist. We may suggest that underlined neuropsychological processes, probably based on biologically determined self- or other-deceptive mechanisms, may serve in the development, and even the conservation, of at least some of the social behaviors related to the fake news phenomenon. These mechanisms may support the human tendency for biased information-seeking, and even the evolutionary persistence of the fake news phenomenon.9 However, in cases such as of COVID-19 pandemic, the native urge to deceive ourselves and others is not without risk. Beliefs in COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives and fake news are negatively associated with vaccination willingness and infection-preventive behavior.1 The COVID-19 pandemic and associated infodemic have magnified the underlying problem of trust. The vaccine hesitancy is primarily a trust issue rather than an informational problem. Fake news, rumors and conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and vaccines should not be understood only as false beliefs, but also as indicators of popular anxieties and fears. Stress inoculation treatment can help people prepare for subsequent misinformation exposure and to increase misinformation detection.10 Finally, policymakers are advised to build information literacy skills for different levels and environments, and to move away from polarization attitudes and behaviors.",

However, this practice overlooks important sources of variability resulting in potentially misleading estimates and may conflate response bias with participants\u2019 underlying sensitivity to detect lies from truths. We showcase an alternative approach using a signal detection theory (SDT) with generalized linear mixed models framework to address these limitations. This SDT approach incorporates individual differences from both judges and senders, which are a principal source of spurious findings in deception research. By avoiding data transformations and aggregations, this methodology outperforms traditional methods and provides more informative and reliable effect estimates. This well-established framework offers researchers a powerful tool for analyzing deception data and advances our understanding of veracity judgments. All code and data are openly available.",

I deal with the definition of lying, and present new empirical data supporting the traditional account of the notion (called the \u2018subjective definition\u2019), contradicting recent claims in favour of a falsity clause (leading to an \u2018objective definition\u2019). Next, I analyze non-standard cases of deception through the categories of misleading defaults and omissions of information. I use qualitative belief revision to examine a puzzle due to R. Smullyan about the possibility of triggering a default inference to deceive an addressee by omission. Secondly, I consider evaluative aspects. I take the perspective of military intelligence data processing to offer a typology of informational messages based on the descriptive dimensions of truth (for message contents) and honesty (for message sources). I also propose a numerical procedure to evaluate these messages based on the evaluative dimensions of credibility (for truth) and reliability (for honesty). Quantitative plausibility models are used to capture degrees of prior credibility of messages, and dynamic rules are defined to update these degrees depending on the reliability of the source.",

      "abstract": "The terms \"post-truth\" and \"fake news\" have become increasingly prevalent in public discourse over the last year. This article explores the growing abundance of misinformation, how it influences people, and how to counter it. We examine the ways in which misinformation can have an adverse impact on society. We summarize how people respond to corrections of misinformation, and what kinds of corrections are most effective. We argue that to be effective, scientific research into misinformation must be considered within a larger political, technological, and societal context. The post-truth world emerged as a result of societal mega-trends such as a decline in social capital, growing economic inequality, increased polarization, declining trust in science, and an increasingly fractionated media landscape. We suggest that responses to this malaise must involve technological solutions incorporating psychological principles, an interdisciplinary approach that we describe as \"technocognition.\" We outline a number of recommendations to counter misinformation in a post-truth world.",

      "abstract": "Although the existence of propaganda in liberal democratic states is frequently denied it continues to play a central role especially with respect to war and conflict. Propaganda, understood as a non-consensual approach to influencing beliefs and behaviour, involves a variety of manipulative techniques including deception through lying, omission and distortion as well as incentivization and coercion. Also, it is generated across multiple sites including government, media, academia, think tanks, NGOs and popular culture. A preliminary analysis of the 2011-present Syrian War and UK propaganda indicates how a range of non-governmental and civil society actors, purportedly independent but many with links to Western governments, have been involved in promoting Western government narratives regarding the war and underpinned a misleading impression that Western governments are bystanders to the conflict. As such, the role of the UK in fostering 'regime-change' in Syria has remained obfuscated with serious consequences for democratic control over foreign policy.",

      "abstract": "Is lying morally worse than misleading? The traditional view in philosophy is that it is, although convincing arguments have also been offered for the view that lying and misleading are morally equal (Saul, 2012a). I here report the results of addressing this question empirically. Specifically, I tested ordinary English speakers\u2019 intuitions on the question whether the moral status of lying versus misleading depends on whether it is overall forbidden, permissible, or obligatory to deceive someone. Timmermann &amp;amp; Viebahn (2021) recently proposed that lies are, on average, stronger causes of false beliefs than misleading statements. When morality demands that we deceive someone (such as Kant\u2019s murderer at the door, asking for the location of his innocent victims), lying may thus even be morally better than misleading, since lying is the stronger cause of a desirable outcome here. I could confirm that people take lies to be the more reliable means of deception than misleading statements, possibly because they take speakers to be more committed to the deceptive content of their utterance when they lie. When deception was forbidden, lying was accordingly judged as morally worse than misleading, as Timmermann and Viebahn\u2019s (2021) account predicts. In cases of obligatory deception, lying was indeed sometimes seen as morally better than misleading (in a scenario modelled closely on the murderer at the door case), but not in two other tested scenarios. I discuss possible reasons and outline avenues for further research. Since lying and misleading are concepts that are deeply embedded in everyday life and discourse, I argue that philosophers should take ordinary speakers\u2019 moral intuitions on this matter seriously.",

However, many user profiles in OSNs contain misleading, inconsistent or false information. Existing studies have shown that lying in OSNs is quite widespread, often for protecting a user's privacy. In order for OSNs to continue expanding their role as a communication medium in our society, it is crucial for information posted on OSNs to be trusted. Here we define a set of analysis methods for detecting deceptive information about user genders in Twitter. In addition, we report empirical results with our stratified data set consisting of 174,600 Twitter profiles with a 50-50 breakdown between male and female users. Our automated approach compares gender indicators obtained from different profile characteristics including first name, user name, and layout colors. We establish the overall accuracy of each indicator and the strength of all possible values for each indicator through extensive experimentations with our data set. We define male trending users and female trending users based on two factors, namely the overall accuracy of each characteristic and the relative strength of the value of each characteristic for a given user. We apply a Bayesian classifier to the weighted average of characteristics for each user. We flag for possible deception profiles that we classify as male or female in contrast with a self-declared gender that we obtain independently of Twitter profiles. Finally, we use manual inspections on a subset of profiles that we identify as potentially deceptive in order to verify the correctness of our predictions.",

Some companies mislead their stakeholders through a phenomenon called greenwashing. Results This paper aims to explore the phenomenon of greenwashing through a systematic literature review in search of its main concepts and typologies in the past 10 years. This research has followed the proceedings of a systematic review of the literature, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). We identified a major classification of greenwashing: firm-level executional, firm-level claim, product-level executional, and product-level claim. Conclusion It was possible to highlight and catalog the types of the phenomenon. A structure based on such type has been observed in the literature.",

To save her from useless pain in the moments before her death, you say, \u2018I saw him yesterday and he was well\u2019, which is true. This answer is intended to deceive her; you want her to believe that he is now well. But you did not lie because you believe what you said.

Yet Jennifer Mather Saul argues that the distinction between lying and what she calls misleading\u2014that is, deceiving while saying only what you believe\u2014has important implications in the philosophy of language. Suppose, for example, that you identified what is said by an utterance with all the beliefs the speaker intended the hearer to get from it. Then, in Saul's example of the dying mother, you will have to count your kind deception as a lie. You intended to make her think that her son is now well, which you know to be false. But, Saul claims, your kind deception obviously is not a lie. So any theory of what is said that entails that it is a lie must be wrong.",

Disinformation can cause significant harm if people are misled by it. In order to address this critical threat to information quality, we first need to understand exactly what disinformation is. This paper surveys the various analyses of this concept that have been proposed by information scientists and philosophers (most notably, Luciano Floridi). It argues that these analyses are either too broad (that is, that they include things that are not disinformation), or too narrow (they exclude things that are disinformation), or both. Indeed, several of these analyses exclude important forms of disinformation, such as true disinformation, visual disinformation, side-effect disinformation, and adaptive disinformation. After considering the shortcomings of these analyses, the paper argues that disinformation is misleading information that has the function of misleading. Finally, in addition to responding to Floridi\u2019s claim that such a precise analysis of disinformation is not necessary, it briefly discusses how this analysis can help us develop techniques for detecting disinformation and policies for deterring its spread.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A fake news detection system aims to assist users in detecting and filtering out varieties of potentially deceptive news. The prediction of the chances that a particular news item is intentionally deceptive is based on the analysis of previously seen truthful and deceptive news. A scarcity of deceptive news, available as corpora for predictive modeling, is a major stumbling block in this field of natural language processing (NLP) and deception detection. This paper discusses three types of fake news, each in contrast to genuine serious reporting, and weighs their pros and cons as a corpus for text analytics and predictive modeling. Filtering, vetting, and verifying online information continues to be essential in library and information science (LIS), as the lines between traditional news and online information are blurring.",

      "abstract": "Efficient communication leaves gaps between message and meaning. Interlocutors, by reasoning about how each other reasons, can help to fill these gaps. To the extent that such meta-inference is not calibrated, communication is impaired, raising the possibility of manipulation for deceptive ends. We examined how people reason when acting as the perpetrator or target of deception across two related experiments. Importantly, the nature of the task precluded outright lying. Thus, deception required withholding information or providing data that was factually correct but nonetheless misleading. We find evidence for two distinct patterns of behaviour. One group of people appear to make assumptions about communicative intent based on context and message content. Senders in this group were more likely to mislead, and receivers were more effectively misled. A second group of people appeared to adopt a more defensive stance, displaying the same cautious approach in all situations. We explain this behaviour using a computational account of the kinds of inferences required by both receiver and sender. These distinct patterns arise from different assumptions about the generative process behind communication.",

In the latter, informed consent is the rule; in the first, while consent may be informed in some narrow sense of the word, deception is common. However, the trickery of placebo experimentation goes beyond straightforward lies to include the use of crafty ambiguities, half-truths, and deliberate omissions in scripts read to the subjects of these studies. As words come to resemble therapeutic agents in their own right, it is only to be expected that researchers would methodically exploit verbal effects to evoke the responses they are looking for. Even experiments in which placebo is disclosed as placebo have used language in leading and misleading ways. Such studies are conducted in the hope of yielding results that might translate into clinical practice, but it should be noted that good clinical practice has a placebo value of its own--that is, confers a benefit over and beyond the specific effects of treatments--even if nothing like a sugar pill is administered.",

In the era of cut-throat competition, the advertisers resort to certain practices such as puffery, deception, etc. and this leads to misleading advertising. The present study examines the ethical issues involved in misleading advertising as perceived by the respondents. This study attempts to explore the various attributes that constitute misleading advertisement. The central issue of the ethical discussion is to determine the various factors revealing the perceptions of the respondents towards the issue of misleading advertising as a whole. The sample of 460 respondents was drawn from the major districts of Punjab, one of the prosperous states of India, and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The scale reliability was tested and factor analysis was used. The study reveals that the most of the respondents are well aware of the various unethical practices of misleading advertisements and perceive these as untruthful business. There are also a few respondents who feel that the exaggeration in advertising may be allowed as a permissible lie. The study provides an ethical implication to the advertisers, who are in the business of making profits, and leaving a word of caution for them to re-evaluate their communication strategies to come out with a new equation of advertising maintaining the balance of professionalism and ethics.",

A corpus of 1,627 articles from 9 political publishers, three each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left, and the hyperpartisan right, have been fact-checked by professional journalists at BuzzFeed: 97% of the 299 fake news articles identified are also hyperpartisan. We show how a style analysis can distinguish hyperpartisan news from the mainstream (F1 = 0.78), and satire from both (F1 = 0.81). But stylometry is no silver bullet as style-based fake news detection does not work (F1 = 0.46). We further reveal that left-wing and right-wing news share significantly more stylistic similarities than either does with the mainstream. This result is robust: it has been confirmed by three different modeling approaches, one of which employs Unmasking in a novel way. Applications of our results include partisanship detection and pre-screening for semi-automatic fake news detection.",

He has a long day of work ahead of him before that, but he is very excited and can\u2019t wait to get there. Dennis\u2019s annoying friend Rebecca comes up to him and starts talking about the party. Dennis is fairly sure that Rebecca won\u2019t go unless she thinks he\u2019s going, too. Rebecca: Are you going to Paul\u2019s party? (1) Dennis: No, I\u2019m not going to Paul\u2019s party. (2) Dennis: I have to work. Rebecca comes to believe that Dennis is not going to Paul\u2019s party. In (1), Dennis tricks Rebecca into a false belief by explicitly expressing a falsehood. By contrast, in (2) Dennis achieves his aim in a less direct way, namely by means of a conversational implicature. Cases of the first kind are usually described as cases of lying, while cases of the second kind are characterized as merely misleading. Philosophers have discussed such pairs of cases with regard to the question of whether lying is morally different from misleading. In this paper, we report the results of approaching this question empirically, by presenting 761 participants with ten matched cases of lying versus misleading in separate as well as joint evaluation designs. By and large, we found that cases of lying and misleading were judged to be morally on a par, to have roughly the same consequences for future trust, and to elicit roughly the same inferences about the speaker\u2019s moral character. When asked what kind of deception participants would choose if they had to deceive another person, the clear majority preferred misleading over lying.

      "abstract": "Satire is an attractive subject in deception detection research: it is a type of deception that intentionally incorporates cues revealing its own deceptiveness.Whereas other types of fabrications aim to instill a false sense of truth in the reader, a successful satirical hoax must eventually be exposed as a jest.This paper provides a conceptual overview of satire and humor, elaborating and illustrating the unique features of satirical news, which mimics the format and style of journalistic reporting.Satirical news stories were carefully matched and examined in contrast with their legitimate news counterparts in 12 contemporary news topics in 4 domains (civics, science, business, and \"soft\" news).Building on previous work in satire detection, we proposed an SVMbased algorithm, enriched with 5 predictive features (Absurdity, Humor, Grammar, Negative Affect, and Punctuation) and tested their combinations on 360 news articles.Our best predicting feature combination (Absurdity, Grammar and Punctuation) detects satirical news with a 90% precision and 84% recall (F-score=87%).Our work in algorithmically identifying satirical news pieces can aid in minimizing the potential deceptive impact of satire.",

      "abstract": "In the past few years, human-robot deception has been receiving growing attention in several fields (e.g., human-robot interaction, laws, philosophy, and psychology). While deception both in human-human and human-robot interactions may have positive consequences, it still presents philosophical and psychological controversy. In particular, verbal deceptions (i.e., in the form of lies or misleading information) may be judged as intentional behaviour at times. While intentionality has been recognised as fundamental in the development of trust, it is not yet fully clear which mechanisms can be designed to foster trust and the potential issues connected to deception. To this extent, in this study, we investigate whether the ability of mentalizing may be one of such mechanisms. We conducted a user study during a public fair, where participants played an assistive game with a robot endowed with Theory of Mind (ToM). We collected the responses from 37 participants to evaluate their perception of trust in the robot. During the game, the robot may occasionally have deceptive behaviours suggesting the wrong move to the human players. Our results showed that a deceptive robot was less trusted compared to a non-deceiving one. We also found that people's perception of the robot was positively affected by the frequency of exposure to deception (i.e., wrong suggestions).",
