      "abstract": "Despite their broad applicability, transformer-based models still fall short in System~2 reasoning, lacking the generality and adaptivity needed for human--AI alignment. We examine weaknesses on ARC-AGI tasks, revealing gaps in compositional generalization and novel-rule adaptation, and argue that closing these gaps requires overhauling the reasoning pipeline and its evaluation. We propose three research axes: (1) Symbolic representation pipeline for compositional generality, (2) Interactive feedback-driven reasoning loop for adaptivity, and (3) Test-time task augmentation balancing both qualities. Finally, we demonstrate how ARC-AGI's evaluation suite can be adapted to track progress in symbolic generality, feedback-driven adaptivity, and task-level robustness, thereby guiding future work on robust human--AI alignment.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential in healthcare but face critical challenges in ethical and safety compliance. We present a lightweight multi-agent refinement framework that enhances medical LLM safety through structured, iterative alignment. The system pairs DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM as generative models with LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4 as evaluator agents that iteratively assess and refine responses against the American Medical Association's nine Principles (AMA-9) and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5). Using 900 adversarial clinical prompts from the MedSafety-Eval subset, we measure convergence, violation reduction, and risk downgrading under a structured five-iteration refinement loop. The multi-agent pipeline reduced ethical violations by 89% and achieved a 92% risk-downgrade rate. DeepSeek R1 outperforms Med-PaLM in convergence efficiency (94.2% convergence; mean 2.34 iterations) compared with Med-PaLM (91.8% convergence; mean 2.67 iterations). Domain analyses reveal consistent gains across emergency, diagnostic, and therapeutic scenarios, while non-convergent cases highlight areas for improvement in legal and privacy domains. Our approach offers a scalable, cost-effective protocol for enhancing medical AI trustworthiness and provides a practical pathway toward regulator-aligned deployment of LLMs in clinical settings.",

Despite its potential, many AI systems fail to meet real-world expectations due to limited evaluation practices that focus narrowly on short-term metrics like efficiency and technical accuracy. Ignoring factors such as usability, trust, transparency, and adaptability hinders AI adoption, scalability, and long-term impact in health care. This paper emphasizes the importance of embedding scientific evaluation as a core operational layer throughout the AI life cycle. We outline practical guidelines for digital health companies to improve AI integration and evaluation, informed by over 35 years of experience in science, the digital health industry, and AI development. It describes a multistep approach, including stakeholder analysis, real-time monitoring, and iterative improvement, that digital health companies can adopt to ensure robust AI integration. Key recommendations include assessing stakeholder needs, designing AI systems that can check its own work, conducting testing to address usability and biases, and ensuring continuous improvement to keep systems user-centered and adaptable. By integrating these guidelines, digital health companies can improve AI reliability, scalability, and trustworthiness, driving better health care delivery and stakeholder alignment.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated growing interest in their structured reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks involving abstraction and pattern recognition. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark plays a crucial role in evaluating these capabilities by testing how well AI models generalize to novel problems. While GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance by solving all ARC tasks under zero-noise conditions, other models like DeepSeek R1 and LLaMA 3.2 fail to solve any, suggesting limitations in their ability to reason beyond simple pattern matching. To explore this gap, we systematically evaluate these models across different noise levels and temperature settings. Our results reveal that the introduction of noise consistently impairs model performance, regardless of architecture. This decline highlights a shared vulnerability: current LLMs, despite showing signs of abstract reasoning, remain highly sensitive to input perturbations. Such fragility raises concerns about their real-world applicability, where noise and uncertainty are common. By comparing how different model architectures respond to these challenges, we offer insights into the structural weaknesses of modern LLMs in reasoning tasks. This work underscores the need for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems capable of handling the ambiguity and variability inherent in real-world scenarios. Our findings aim to guide future research toward enhancing model generalization, robustness, and alignment with human-like cognitive flexibility.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of benchmarks has created significant challenges in reproducibility, transparency, and informed decision-making. However, unlike datasets and models -- which benefit from structured documentation frameworks like Datasheets and Model Cards -- evaluation methodologies lack systematic documentation standards. We introduce Eval Factsheets, a structured, descriptive framework for documenting AI system evaluations through a comprehensive taxonomy and questionnaire-based approach. Our framework organizes evaluation characteristics across five fundamental dimensions: Context (Who made the evaluation and when?), Scope (What does it evaluate?), Structure (With what the evaluation is built?), Method (How does it work?) and Alignment (In what ways is it reliable/valid/robust?). We implement this taxonomy as a practical questionnaire spanning five sections with mandatory and recommended documentation elements. Through case studies on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that Eval Factsheets effectively captures diverse evaluation paradigms -- from traditional benchmarks to LLM-as-judge methodologies -- while maintaining consistency and comparability. We hope Eval Factsheets are incorporated into both existing and newly released evaluation frameworks and lead to more transparency and reproducibility.",

Current methods typically rely on limited real-world data or simplified simulated representations that do not capture the complexity and variability of human digital twin and AI agent behavior. VirTLab-Eval is a novel agentic framework of human digital twins (HDTs) and AI agents to model and evaluate HAT behaviors and interventions across operational scenarios. A comprehensive set of measures, including novel socio-cognitive-emotional and behavioral metrics automatically extracted from team communications and interactions, for evaluating HAT performance is integrated into visual analytics enabling the assessment of interventions that target the attributes of HDTs and agents. VirTLab-Eval measurements capture nuanced aspects of trust development, emotional alignment, and team cohesion that conventional performance metrics might miss, providing richer insights into the HAT dynamics. Example results from search and rescue missions indicate that AI teammate reliability has a significant effect on communication dynamics and assistance behaviors, while Human Digital Twin (HDT) personality traits shape trust development and team coordination. These insights directly inform the design of Human-AI Teaming (HAT) training programs aimed at optimizing the use of AI systems, mitigating both over-reliance and under-utilization, and ultimately enhancing mission effectiveness while reducing risk to personnel.",

      "abstract": "Large language models generate plausible text responses to medical questions, but inaccurate responses pose significant risks in medical decision-making. Grading LLM outputs to determine the best model or answer is time-consuming and impractical in clinical settings; therefore, we introduce EVAL (Expert-of-Experts Verification and Alignment) to streamline this process and enhance LLM safety for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). We evaluated OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5/4/4o/o1-preview, Anthropic\u2019s Claude-3-Opus, Meta\u2019s LLaMA-2 (7B/13B/70B), and Mistral AI\u2019s Mixtral (7B) across 27 configurations, including zero-shot baseline, retrieval-augmented generation, and supervised fine-tuning. EVAL uses similarity-based ranking and a reward model trained on human-graded responses for rejection sampling. Among the employed similarity metrics, Fine-Tuned ColBERT achieved the highest alignment with human performance across three separate datasets (\u03c1\u2009=\u20090.81\u20130.91). The reward model replicated human grading with 87.9% of cases across temperature settings and significantly improved accuracy through rejection sampling by 8.36% overall. EVAL offers scalable potential to assess accuracy for high-stakes medical decision-making.",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an opportunity to create transparent, evidence-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems tailored to surgical practice.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe authors developed CASPER, a domain-specific, multimodal RAG system with text and image analysis capabilities, built with RAPTOR hierarchical architecture and a knowledge base of 8561 open-access craniofacial surgery articles (2000-2025). The system retrieved and synthesized peer-reviewed literature in response to 25 clinical questions spanning craniofacial subspecialties. Performance was evaluated using semantic similarity (SEM-eval) to retrieved documents, manual content coverage review, and manual citation accuracy verification.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCASPER achieved strong alignment with supporting literature (mean SEM-eval 0.89\u00b10.04; range: 0.81-0.96), integrating an average of 7.8 sources per query. Highest performance was observed in pediatric airway (0.93), facial trauma (0.93), and oncologic surgery (0.95), with top scores for Pierre-Robin mandibular distraction (0.96) and orbital floor fracture management (0.95). Lower scores occurred in complex or emerging domains such as Le Fort III contraindications (0.81) and facial feminization planning (0.81). Manual review confirmed that CASPER maintained high content coverage across scenarios, with citations consistently accurate and directly supportive of system outputs.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCASPER is the first citation-enabled AI system for craniofacial surgery and demonstrates expert-comparable reasoning across diverse clinical scenarios. By delivering transparent, evidence-grounded recommendations, CASPER has the potential to enhance surgical planning, improve decision-making consistency, and accelerate knowledge translation in both clinical practice and surgical education.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled self-improving AI systems that iteratively generate, evaluate, and refine their outcomes. Recent studies show that prompt-optimization-based self-improvement can outperform state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning fine-tuning of LLMs, but performance is typically measured by generation efficiency. However, in many applications, the constraint is evaluation efficiency: obtaining reliable feedback is far more costly than generating candidates. To optimize for evaluation efficiency, we extend Upper Confidence Bound-Bayesian Optimization (UCB-BO), a framework known for optimal evaluation-efficiency guarantees, to the language domain. Doing so is challenging for two reasons: (i) gradients needed for UCB-BO are ill-defined in discrete prompt space; and (ii) UCB-style exploration relies on a surrogate model and acquisition function, which only live implicitly in the LLM. We overcome these challenges by proving that combining simple textual gradients (LLM-proposed local edits) with the Best-of-N selection strategy statistically emulates ascent along the gradient of the canonical UCB acquisition function. Based on this result, we propose TextBO, a simple, evaluation-efficient self-improving algorithm that operates purely in language space without explicit surrogates or calibrated uncertainty models. We empirically validate TextBO on automated ad-alignment tasks using a persona-induced preference distribution, demonstrating superior performance per evaluation compared to strong baselines such as Best-of-N and GEPA. We also evaluate TextBO's Best-of-N multi-step textual-gradient mechanism on agentic AI benchmarks by augmenting GEPA with it and show that it significantly outperforms standard GEPA. In sum, TextBO is a simple and principled framework for AI self-improving system design that bridges prompt optimization with classical Bayesian optimization.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: The integration of AI chatbots in nursing education, particularly in simulation-based learning, is advancing rapidly. However, there is a lack of structured evaluation models, especially to assess AI-generated simulations. This article introduces the AI-Integrated Method for Simulation (AIMS) evaluation framework, a dual-phase evaluation framework adapted from the FAITA model, designed to evaluate both prompt design and chatbot performance in the context of nursing education. Methods: This simulation-based study explored the application of an AI chatbot in an emergency planning course. The AIMS framework was developed and applied, consisting of six prompt-level domains (Phase 1) and eight performance criteria (Phase 2). These domains were selected based on current best practices in instructional design, simulation fidelity, and emerging AI evaluation literature. To assess the chatbots educational utility, the study employed a scoring rubric for each phase and incorporated a structured feedback loop to refine both prompt design and chatbox interaction. To demonstrate the framework\u2019s practical application, the researchers configured an AI tool referred to in this study as \u201cEval-Bot v1\u201d, built using OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.0, to apply Phase 1 scoring criteria to a real simulation prompt. Insights from this analysis were then used to anticipate Phase 2 performance and identify areas for improvement. Participants (three individuals)\u2014all experienced healthcare educators and advanced practice nurses with expertise in clinical decision-making and simulation-based teaching\u2014reviewed the prompt and Eval-Bot\u2019s score to triangulate findings. Results: Simulated evaluations revealed clear strengths in the prompt alignment with course objectives and its capacity to foster interactive learning. Participants noted that the AI chatbot supported engagement and maintained appropriate pacing, particularly in scenarios involving emergency planning decision-making. However, challenges emerged in areas related to personalization and inclusivity. While the chatbot responded consistently to general queries, it struggled to adapt tone, complexity and content to reflect diverse learner needs or cultural nuances. To support replication and refinement, a sample scoring rubric and simulation prompt template are provided. When evaluated using the Eval-Bot tool, moderate concerns were flagged regarding safety prompts and inclusive language, particularly in how the chatbot navigated sensitive decision points. These gaps were linked to predicted performance issues in Phase 2 domains such as dialog control, equity, and user reassurance. Based on these findings, revised prompt strategies were developed to improve contextual sensitivity, promote inclusivity, and strengthen ethical guidance within chatbot-led simulations. Conclusions: The AIMS evaluation framework provides a practical and replicable approach for evaluating the use of AI chatbots in simulation-based education. By offering structured criteria for both prompt design and chatbot performance, the model supports instructional designers, simulation specialists, and developers in identifying areas of strength and improvement. The findings underscore the importance of intentional design, safety monitoring, and inclusive language when integrating AI into nursing and health education. As AI tools become more embedded in learning environments, this framework offers a thoughtful starting point for ensuring they are applied ethically, effectively, and with learner diversity in mind.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been shown to help dermatologists diagnose melanoma more accurately, however they lack transparency, hindering user acceptance. Explainable AI (XAI) methods can help to increase transparency, yet often lack precise, domain-specific explanations. Moreover, the impact of XAI methods on dermatologists\u2019 decisions has not yet been evaluated. Building upon previous research, we introduce an XAI system that provides precise and domain-specific explanations alongside its differential diagnoses of melanomas and nevi. Through a three-phase study, we assess its impact on dermatologists\u2019 diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and trust in the XAI-support. Our results show strong alignment between XAI and dermatologist explanations. We also show that dermatologists\u2019 confidence in their diagnoses, and their trust in the support system significantly increase with XAI compared to conventional AI. This study highlights dermatologists\u2019 willingness to adopt such XAI systems, promoting future use in the clinic. Artificial intelligence has become popular as a cancer classification tool, but there is distrust of such systems due to their lack of transparency. Here, the authors develop an explainable AI system which produces text- and region-based explanations alongside its classifications which was assessed using clinicians\u2019 diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic confidence, and their trust in the system.",

      "abstract": "The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems'capabilities. We introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21 open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding; and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal (audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI assistants. Code and data will be released at https://mathllm.github.io/VoiceAssistantEval/ .",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) transition from static tools to autonomous agents, traditional evaluation benchmarks that measure performance on downstream tasks are becoming insufficient. These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled\"social laboratory\"to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\\mu}>0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents. We have released the code and results at https://github.com/znreza/multi-agent-LLM-eval-for-debate.",

      "abstract": "\n Timely and accurate diagnosis of lung diseases is critical for reducing related morbidity and mortality. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a useful point\u2010of\u2010care tool for evaluating various lung conditions. However, interpreting LUS images remains challenging due to operator\u2010dependent variability, low image quality, and limited availability of experts in many regions. In this study, we present a lightweight and efficient deep learning model, ParSE\u2010CNN, alongside fine\u2010tuned versions of VGG\u201016, InceptionV3, Xception, and Vision Transformer architectures, to classify LUS images into three categories: COVID\u201019, other lung pathology, and healthy lung. Models were trained using data from public sources and Ugandan healthcare facilities, and evaluated on a held\u2010out Ugandan dataset. Fine\u2010tuned VGG\u201016 achieved the highest classification performance with 98% accuracy, 97% precision, 98% recall, and a 97% F1\u2010score. ParSE\u2010CNN yielded a competitive accuracy of 95%, precision of 94%, recall of 95%, and F1\u2010score of 97% while offering a 58.3% faster inference time (0.006\u2009s vs. 0.014\u2009s) and a lower parameter count (5.18\u2009M vs. 10.30\u2009M) than VGG\u201016. To enhance input quality, we developed a preprocessing pipeline, and to improve interpretability, we employed Grad\u2010CAM heatmaps, which showed high alignment with radiologically relevant features. Finally, ParSE\u2010CNN was integrated into a mobile LUS workflow with a PC backend, enabling real\u2010time AI\u2010assisted diagnosis at the point of care in low\u2010resource settings.",

This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction. Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination, and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized, theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts. CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.",

The study aims to assess the performance of these LLM models in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses to common queries. These models were evaluated using key metrics such as evaluation loss (eval loss) and ROUGE scores (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2), which measure the alignment between the generated responses and the reference answers. The experiment results show that BERT outperforms the other models, achieving a lowest eval loss and highest ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores, making it the most effective model in this context. The findings underscore the potential of BERT in educational AI applications. Finally, some future research directions are discussed, including the integration of additional models and the enhancement of the FAQ dataset to further improve performance.",

The goal of the detector alignment is to determine the detector geometry as accurately as possible and correct for time-dependent movements. The Inner Detector alignment is based on the minimization of track-hit residuals in a sequence of hierarchical levels, from global mechanical assembly structures to local sensors. Subsequent levels have increasing numbers of degrees of freedom; in total there are almost 750000. The alignment determines detector geometry on both short and long timescales, where short timescales describe movements within an LHC fill. The performance and possible track parameter biases originating from systematic detector deformations are evaluated. Momentum biases are studied using resonances decaying to muons or to electrons. The residual sagitta bias and momentum scale bias after alignment are reduced to less than $\\sim$0.1 TeV$^{-1}$ and 0.9$\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Impact parameter biases are also evaluated using tracks within jets.",

      "abstract": "For the first time, this position paper introduces a fundamental link between tensor networks (TNs) and Green AI, highlighting their synergistic potential to enhance both the inclusivity and sustainability of AI research. We argue that TNs are valuable for Green AI due to their strong mathematical backbone and inherent logarithmic compression potential. We undertake a comprehensive review of the ongoing discussions on Green AI, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and inclusivity in AI research to demonstrate the significance of establishing the link between Green AI and TNs. To support our position, we first provide a comprehensive overview of efficiency metrics proposed in Green AI literature and then evaluate examples of TNs in the fields of kernel machines and deep learning using the proposed efficiency metrics. This position paper aims to incentivize meaningful, constructive discussions by bridging fundamental principles of Green AI and TNs. We advocate for researchers to seriously evaluate the integration of TNs into their research projects, and in alignment with the link established in this paper, we support prior calls encouraging researchers to treat Green AI principles as a research priority.",

      "abstract": "Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are increasingly deployed to support self-regulated learning on online courses. Yet many existing dashboards lack strong theoretical grounding, contextual alignment, or actionable feedback, and some designs have been shown to inadvertently discourage learners through excessive social comparison or high inference costs. In this study, we designed and evaluated a LAD grounded in the COPES model of self-regulated learning and tailored to a credit-bearing Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) using a data-driven approach. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 8745 learners, comparing a control group, a dashboard without feedback, and a dashboard with ARCS-framed actionable feedback. The results showed that the dashboard with feedback significantly increased learners\u2019 likelihood of verification (i.e., paying for the certification track), with mixed effects on engagement and no measurable impact on final grades. These findings suggest that dashboards are not uniformly beneficial: while feedback-supported LADs can enhance motivation and persistence, dashboards that lack interpretive support may impose cognitive burdens without improving outcomes. This study contributes to the literature on learning analytics by (1) articulating the design principles for theoretically and contextually grounded LADs and (2) providing experimental evidence on their impact in authentic MOOC settings.",

      "abstract": "For centuries, the analysis of dance has relied on subjective observation and qualitative descriptions. The emergence of motion capture technology and artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing this landscape, offering objective data and novel tools for analyzing and interpreting movement. This paper explores the transformative impact of these technologies on various aspects of dance analysis, including: Technique Assessment: Motion capture provides precise metrics for evaluating movement accuracy, alignment, and efficiency, unlocking new possibilities for personalized training and injury prevention. Choreographic Deconstruction: AI algorithms can identify patterns, motifs, and emotional arcs within complex dance pieces, offering deeper insights into choreographic intent and audience perception. Expressive Movement Analysis: By analyzing subtle nuances in body language and facial expressions, AI can shed light on the emotional and communicative dimensions of dance, enriching interpretation and fostering empathy with the performers. Historical Archival and Preservation: Motion capture can digitally preserve endangered dance forms and cultural traditions, facilitating cross-cultural exchange and ensuring accessibility for future generations. This paper examines the benefits and challenges of employing these technologies in dance analysis, addressing concerns about objectivity, authenticity, and the potential loss of the human element. It concludes by exploring potential future directions, arguing that motion capture and AI, when used thoughtfully and ethically, can enhance our understanding and appreciation of dance while fostering innovation and creative expression in this timeless art form.",

      "abstract": "With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the\"LM-as-judge\"paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a novel, self-supervised, data-efficient distillation method that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset of 840 physician-annotated outputs across 6 diverse medical tasks capturing real-world challenges. Across 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source and proprietary models, MedVAL distillation significantly improves (p<0.001) alignment with physicians across seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%. Despite strong baseline performance, MedVAL improves the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8% without training on physician-labeled data, demonstrating a performance statistically non-inferior to a single human expert (p<0.001). To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source: 1) Codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B). Our benchmark provides evidence of LMs approaching expert-level ability in validating AI-generated medical text.",

To address this we propose augmenting phishing email datasets using fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) to generate adaptable, privacy-preserving email templates. We evaluate two SLMs\u2014GPT-2 (1.5B parameters) and Gemma3 (1B parameters)\u2014fine-tuned on preprocessed phishing and benign email messages. Our approach combines template generation via structured prompts with preprocessing to anonymise sensitive data and fine-tuning. Results for phishing generation showed that GPT-2 achieves higher alignment with reference templates, while Gemma3 generated more novel and diverse outputs. For benign emails, both models achieved very similar results. The findings highlight the importance of model selection based on use-case priorities, the usage of fine-tuning in addition to prompting to mitigate privacy risks and the viability of SLMs for the generation of email templates.",

      "abstract": "There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in long-form medical question answering (QA). Most existing medical QA evaluation benchmarks focus on automatic metrics and multiple-choice questions. While valuable, these benchmarks fail to fully capture or assess the complexities of real-world clinical applications where LLMs are being deployed. Furthermore, existing studies on evaluating long-form answer generation in medical QA are primarily closed-source, lacking access to human medical expert annotations, which makes it difficult to reproduce results and enhance existing baselines. In this work, we introduce a new publicly available benchmark featuring real-world consumer medical questions with long-form answer evaluations annotated by medical doctors. We performed pairwise comparisons of responses from various open and closed-source medical and general-purpose LLMs based on criteria such as correctness, helpfulness, harmfulness, and bias. Additionally, we performed a comprehensive LLM-as-a-judge analysis to study the alignment between human judgments and LLMs. Our preliminary results highlight the strong potential of open LLMs in medical QA compared to leading closed models.
