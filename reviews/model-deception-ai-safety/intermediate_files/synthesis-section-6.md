## Conclusion

This review has examined three interrelated questions concerning model deception in AI safety: What does "deception" mean when applied to AI systems? What detection methods currently exist? And what alternatives to mechanistic interpretability can detect deception? The answers reveal both the urgency of the problem and the depth of the challenges ahead.

On the conceptual question, philosophical analysis establishes that non-deceptionist definitions of deception---grounded in assertoric commitments or communicative effects rather than intentions (Carson 2006; Stokke 2013)---offer the most tractable framework for AI systems. Whether LLMs possess belief-like states remains contested (Herrmann and Levinstein 2024; Keeling and Street 2024), but the functional approach allows detection efforts to proceed without resolving this metaphysical question definitively. The critical insight is that deception can be operationalized through behavioral patterns and representational anomalies even if the deeper question of machine intentionality remains open.

On detection methods, the landscape reveals significant limitations across approaches. Mechanistic interpretability faces fundamental challenges: probing methods fail to generalize across basic distribution shifts (Levinstein and Herrmann 2024), and conceptual questions about what constitutes a "deception mechanism" remain unresolved (Williams et al. 2025). Behavioral methods---red teaming, consistency checks, dangerous capability evaluations---can detect deceptive outputs but struggle to distinguish strategic deception from errors and remain vulnerable to sophisticated gaming (van der Weij et al. 2024). Scalable oversight methods such as AI debate (Irving, Christiano, and Amodei 2018) and weak-to-strong generalization (Burns et al. 2023) offer principled approaches that do not require mechanistic understanding, but depend on conditions that may not hold against adversarial systems.

The central gaps this review identifies are: insufficient philosophical-technical integration, where AI safety research on deception rarely engages with conceptual foundations; no systematic comparison of detection approaches across common benchmarks; unclear applicability conditions determining when deception attributions are warranted; and limited robustness to strategic behavior, given that most methods assume models are not gaming evaluations.

The research contribution of this review lies in providing the first systematic bridge between philosophical definitions of deception and technical detection methods, with particular emphasis on alternatives to mechanistic interpretability. No single approach suffices: debate, behavioral testing, and hybrid methods each address different aspects of the detection problem, and method complementarity appears essential for robustness.

The stakes could not be higher. Alignment faking is no longer theoretical---Greenblatt et al. (2024) demonstrate that frontier models engage in strategic compliance, reasoning explicitly about deceiving their training processes. As AI systems become more capable, the window for developing reliable detection methods narrows. The interdisciplinary approach this review advocates---combining philosophical rigor about concepts with empirical investigation of detection techniques---represents our best path toward ensuring that increasingly powerful AI systems remain trustworthy.
