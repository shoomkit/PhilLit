## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [ ] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [ ] Phase 3: Research [N] domains in parallel
- [ ] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [ ] Phase 5: Write review for each section in parallel
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Research Questions

1. How does existing research define "deception"? (philosophy focus: philosophy of language, epistemology)
2. What are techniques to detect model deception? (AI Safety focus)
3. Are there other ways than mechanistic interpretability to detect deception? (AI Safety focus)

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-15 Phase 1: Environment verified, working directory created
2026-01-15 Phase 2: Created lit-review-plan.md (6 domains)
2026-01-15 Phase 3: Completed 6 domain searches (101 papers total)
2026-01-15 Phase 4: Created synthesis-outline.md (3 main sections + intro/gaps/conclusion)
