## Introduction

Traditions are central to political and cultural life. They shape constitutional orders, ground political identities, transmit accumulated wisdom across generations, and provide the interpretive frameworks through which communities make sense of their experience. Yet philosophical analysis of what makes traditions valuable---and what makes them go wrong---remains surprisingly fragmented. Sociologists have catalogued tradition's social functions (Shils 1981), virtue ethicists have embedded tradition within accounts of practical rationality (MacIntyre 1984), and hermeneutic philosophers have rehabilitated tradition against Enlightenment critique (Gadamer 2006; Warnke 1987). But these literatures rarely engage one another systematically, and none offers a comprehensive theory of tradition breakdown.

Three interconnected questions guide this inquiry. First, what *is* tradition conceptually? Traditions occupy an intermediate space between mere conventions (which lack temporal depth and normative weight) and fully institutionalized structures (which possess formal organizational complexity). Beckstein (2017) argues that traditions require patterns of transmission across generations, continuity despite change, and contestable criteria for authentic continuation---but how these requirements relate to convention theory and social ontology remains underexplored. Second, what normative authority do traditions possess? Conservative philosophers from Burke through Oakeshott have argued that traditions embody accumulated practical wisdom exceeding individual rational capacity, while critics from Kant through contemporary feminist philosophers have emphasized tradition's potential for perpetuating prejudice and constraining autonomy. Third, and most pressingly for this project: how do traditions degenerate, ossify, or fail? MacIntyre's (1984) distinction between "living traditions" (which sustain ongoing internal argument about their purposes) and dead ones (which calcify into mere repetition) provides conceptual resources, but systematic application to political and cultural traditions remains limited.

The stakes of this inquiry are considerable. If traditions embody accumulated wisdom, as conservative defenders argue, their breakdown represents genuine epistemic loss---the dissolution of knowledge that cannot be reconstructed from first principles. If traditions transmit meaning across generations, as hermeneutic philosophy demonstrates, their failure produces intelligibility crises in which communities lose the interpretive resources to make sense of their situation. The contemporary moment, marked by contested claims about tradition's value and widespread anxiety about cultural fragmentation, makes these questions urgent.

The literature reveals a productive tension between conservative defenses emphasizing tradition's epistemic and identity-constituting value and critical perspectives emphasizing tradition's potential for oppression and heteronomy. The most sophisticated positions on both sides recognize that this tension cannot be resolved by simply choosing sides. Relational autonomy approaches show how traditions can constitute conditions for meaningful agency while also constraining it; dialectical critiques reveal that pure anti-traditionalism is self-defeating. This review maps these debates while identifying systematic gaps in our understanding of how traditions fail.

The scope is philosophical rather than sociological, though it engages key sociological works where they illuminate conceptual questions. The emphasis falls on political and cultural traditions rather than religious ones, though these categories inevitably overlap. The goal is not encyclopedic coverage but analytical synthesis: identifying the key debates, revealing productive tensions, and specifying gaps that a theory of tradition breakdown must address.


## Section 1: Conceptual Foundations and the Value Debate

Traditions occupy a central yet curiously undertheorized position in political and cultural philosophy. Before assessing whether traditions can fail or degenerate, we must first establish what traditions are and why they matter. This section examines the conceptual terrain, mapping both conservative defenses of tradition's value and critical perspectives that identify tradition's potential for oppression. The tension between these positions proves productive rather than merely adversarial: the most sophisticated accounts on both sides recognize that traditions simultaneously enable and constrain human agency.

### 1.1 What Is Tradition? Conceptual Analysis

The concept of tradition resists easy definition. David Lewis's influential account of conventions provides a useful starting point, though ultimately proves insufficient. For Lewis (1969), conventions are behavioral regularities sustained by mutual expectations: everyone conforms because everyone expects others to conform, and conformity serves coordination. Conventions thus rest on common knowledge and can arise relatively quickly when coordination problems demand solutions. Yet traditions seem different in kind. A tradition of afternoon tea or constitutional governance involves more than solving coordination problems; it requires temporal extension, transmission across generations, and criteria for authentic continuation that conventions lack.

Martin Beckstein (2017) offers the most systematic recent treatment, arguing that traditions are distinguished by three essential features: patterns of transmission across generations, continuity despite change, and contestable criteria for authentic continuation that practitioners recognize and debate. Unlike conventions, traditions cannot emerge overnight; they require the passing of practices, beliefs, or norms from predecessors to successors. Crucially, living traditions allow for development while maintaining identity. The criteria determining what counts as authentic continuation of a tradition are themselves internal to the tradition and subject to ongoing interpretation and dispute among practitioners.

This emphasis on authentic continuation illuminates an important distinction. Andrei Marmor (2009) differentiates "shallow" conventions from "deep" conventions. Shallow conventions are Lewis-type coordination solutions, while deep conventions constitute practices and generate new reasons for action not reducible to coordination benefits. Language exemplifies a deep convention: linguistic rules are arbitrary yet normatively binding, learned through participation rather than explicit agreement, and constitutive of the very activities they govern. Traditions may be understood as deep conventions with the additional requirement of temporal extension and intergenerational transmission.

Edward Shils (1981) provides an influential sociological typology distinguishing substantive traditions (specific beliefs and practices) from formal traditions (patterns of relationship and modes of transmission). For Shils, traditions gain authority partly from pastness itself: that something has been handed down confers a presumption of value requiring specific reasons to override. Struan Jacobs (2007) identifies four distinct perspectives in Shils's work: pragmatic (traditions as solutions to recurrent problems), Burkean (traditions as accumulated wisdom), veridical (traditions as transmitting truth), and evolutionist (traditions as survival-tested practices). These perspectives are not fully integrated, creating productive tensions that illuminate different dimensions of tradition.

Traditions thus occupy conceptual space between simple conventions and fully institutionalized structures. John Searle's (1995) analysis of institutional facts emphasizes how collective acceptance creates social reality through constitutive rules. Yet Searle's framework focuses on synchronic structure---collective acceptance at a moment in time---while traditions essentially involve diachronic transmission. Neither pure coordination devices like conventions nor formal organizations like governments, traditions represent a distinct mode of social continuity. This conceptual distinctiveness matters for understanding breakdown: different conceptions of what traditions are imply different accounts of how they can fail.

### 1.2 The Conservative Case for Tradition

Conservative philosophy offers sophisticated arguments for tradition's epistemic and practical value. At the core lies what Ferenc Horcher (2020) identifies as three interconnected pillars: prudence, moderation, and tradition itself. Prudence represents practical wisdom in politics---the capacity to judge particular situations rightly without algorithmic rules. Moderation involves avoiding ideological extremes. And tradition provides the accumulated experience within which prudential judgment operates. These pillars support each other: prudent judgment requires familiarity with inherited practices; tradition preserves the lessons of experience; moderation guards against rationalist hubris.

The epistemic argument for tradition holds that inherited practices embody collective wisdom exceeding individual rational capacity. G.K. Chesterton's "fence" principle captures this intuition: before removing a fence whose purpose is unknown, one should understand why it was erected. The fence may serve functions invisible to surface inspection but discoverable through inquiry into its history. Similarly, traditions may encode solutions to problems we no longer consciously recognize, or address perennial human difficulties in ways that appear arbitrary only to those who have forgotten the original challenge. Struan Jacobs and Ian Tregenza (2014) trace this debate through the Popper-Oakeshott correspondence. While Karl Popper advocated critical rationalism and piecemeal social engineering, Michael Oakeshott insisted that political knowledge is tacit and embedded in practices, not fully capturable in explicit rules amenable to rationalist reform. For Oakeshott, tradition embodies practical knowledge that exceeds theoretical articulation.

Alasdair MacIntyre (1984) provides the most influential contemporary philosophical account of tradition-constituted rationality. On his view, what counts as good reason depends on tradition-specific standards of inquiry and evaluation. There is no tradition-independent rational standpoint from which to assess all traditions; rationality itself is exercised within traditions that provide its criteria and procedures. Traditions are not static repositories but dynamic arguments extended across time. A living tradition, as MacIntyre conceives it, is "an historically extended, socially embodied argument"---precisely about what the tradition requires and how its goods should be pursued. Traditions thus encompass not only practices but ongoing debates about those practices.

Marcin Kuna (2005) explicates MacIntyre's response to the charge that tradition-constituted rationality collapses into relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions can be rationally compared when one encounters an epistemological crisis it cannot resolve using its own resources while a rival tradition can both explain the crisis and overcome it. Rationality is tradition-bound but not relativistic because traditions vary in their capacity for self-correction and development. Christopher Stephen Lutz (2004) traces how MacIntyre's engagement with Thomism exemplifies this: Aquinas's synthesis of Aristotelian and Augustinian traditions provides resources for addressing problems neither tradition alone could solve.

Beckstein's (2017) concept of living tradition synthesizes these themes. Living traditions exhibit ongoing internal debate, capacity for creative adaptation while maintaining continuity, authentic continuation versus mere repetition, and active engagement by practitioners who understand themselves as participants rather than passive inheritors. This distinguishes genuine traditions from what David Hollenbach (2019) calls "traditionalism"---the dead faith of the living, rigid adherence to past formulas without creative engagement.

Yet historical revisionism raises troubling questions for conservative defenses. Richard Bourke (2018) and Emily Jones (2017) challenge the standard narrative tracing conservatism to Edmund Burke's opposition to the French Revolution. Bourke argues that Burke was an opposition Whig devoted to reform, not a conservative in the modern sense; the idea of a unified conservative tradition was retrospectively constructed rather than historically continuous. Jones traces how Burke was selectively appropriated in the nineteenth century to create a conservative intellectual tradition. If "conservatism" itself is an invented tradition, this complicates epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom: what authority attaches to wisdom that was retrospectively attributed rather than genuinely transmitted?

### 1.3 Liberal and Critical Perspectives

Against conservative defenses stand formidable critical traditions. The Enlightenment positioned reason as sovereign over traditional authority. Frederick Beiser (1996) traces how early English Enlightenment thinkers developed systematic arguments for reason's sovereignty against inherited belief, establishing rationality as the supreme arbiter of truth and legitimacy. Kant's famous injunction to "dare to know" (sapere aude) captures this stance: traditions represent heteronomy, obstacles to the autonomous use of one's own understanding. Maturity requires thinking for oneself rather than deferring to inherited authority.

The liberal tradition develops this Enlightenment critique in political terms. Jennie Ikuta (2020) explicates John Stuart Mill's argument that custom becomes "social tyranny" constraining individual development. For Mill, conformity to tradition has both external dimensions (social coercion through sanctions) and internal dimensions (self-tyranny through undermined capacity for autonomous judgment). Individuality requires both that conformists cease imposing social penalties on nonconformity and that individuals cultivate their own capacity for judgment against mere custom. The harm principle limits intervention in individual liberty while Mill's perfectionist commitments require conditions enabling autonomous development that mere tradition-following cannot provide.

Yet the Enlightenment critique of tradition faces its own dialectical reversal. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (2020) argues that instrumental rationality---reason reduced to calculation and domination of nature---becomes a totalizing force perpetuating the very barbarism the Enlightenment sought to overcome. The Enlightenment becomes what it opposed: a new form of mythical thinking, compulsive and unreflective. This does not vindicate tradition against reason but reveals how rationalist critique can itself become oppressive. Andreas Folkers (2015) traces how Michel Foucault develops a genealogical approach to critique that questions the power effects of rationality itself without assuming an external rational standpoint.

Feminist philosophy has subjected traditions to sustained critique as mechanisms of patriarchal oppression. From Mary Wollstonecraft's arguments that traditional gender hierarchies corrupt both men and women by denying women education and rational development (Berges and Coffee 2016), through contemporary analyses of how traditional practices constrain women's agency, feminism identifies traditions as sites of systematic injustice. Yet feminist thought has also generated the most sophisticated attempts to transcend the stark tradition-versus-autonomy dichotomy.

Relational autonomy theories, developed prominently in feminist philosophy, reject both atomistic individualism and uncritical communitarianism. Ji Young Lee (2023) provides a comprehensive overview: relational accounts recognize how social contexts constitute rather than merely constrain agency, while maintaining critical standards for distinguishing social conditions that enhance from those that hinder autonomy. Persons are socially embedded, but not all social embeddings support autonomous agency. Monique Deveaux (2006) examines how this plays out in concrete cases like arranged marriage, showing how liberal critiques often oversimplify traditional practices by ignoring women's agency within cultural contexts and by assuming autonomy requires wholesale rejection of tradition.

Tanya Zion-Waldoks (2014) provides compelling empirical analysis of Israeli Modern-Orthodox women who engage in feminist resistance as religious actors working for religious ends. She conceptualizes their agency as "devoted resistance"---critique within relationship to tradition, enabled by cultural resources and comprising both interpretive skills and relational autonomy capacities. This challenges assumptions that tradition critique requires external standpoints and illuminates how traditions can contain resources for their own reform. Agency operates not only against tradition but within and through it.

Maeve Cooke (2020) examines Jurgen Habermas's attempt to reconcile private autonomy with public democratic autonomy through communicative rationality. Rather than opposing tradition to reason, Habermas seeks to show how legitimate social norms emerge through deliberative processes that transform rather than simply negate inherited practices. Tradition becomes material for communicative reason rather than its enemy, though Cooke identifies unresolved tensions in Habermas's account regarding the relationship between individual freedom and collective self-legislation.

The most productive critical perspectives thus recognize what Horkheimer and Adorno demonstrated: pure anti-traditionalism is self-defeating. Enlightenment critique of tradition can itself become a new form of unreflective domination. Relational autonomy approaches suggest that the question is not whether to defer to tradition or reject it wholesale, but rather how traditions can constitute conditions for genuine autonomy while remaining subject to critical reconstruction when they constrain or oppress. The liberal and critical perspectives identify ways traditions can fail or become defective---by constraining individual development, perpetuating oppression, or blocking autonomous agency---without assuming that tradition as such is the enemy of human flourishing.

This section has established that traditions are distinct from mere conventions in requiring temporal extension, intergenerational transmission, and criteria for authentic continuation. Their value remains genuinely contested between conservative positions emphasizing accumulated wisdom and tradition-constituted rationality, and critical positions emphasizing potential for oppression and heteronomy. The most sophisticated accounts on both sides recognize this tension rather than resolving it one-sidedly. Conservative theories of living tradition acknowledge the need for internal debate and creative adaptation; critical theories of relational autonomy acknowledge that agency operates within as well as against inherited practices. This contested terrain provides the foundation for examining how traditions can break down---the subject to which subsequent sections turn.


## Section 2: Theories of Tradition Breakdown and Degeneration

Understanding what makes traditions valuable requires grasping how they can fail. While the previous section examined competing accounts of tradition's normative status, this section turns to the more neglected question of tradition pathology: the mechanisms by which traditions degenerate, ossify, or collapse entirely. This represents perhaps the review's most innovative contribution, synthesizing disparate literatures into a systematic account of tradition breakdown. The analysis reveals that tradition failure has multiple interconnected dimensions—epistemological, institutional, hermeneutic, and political—each illuminating different vulnerabilities that traditions face.

### 2.1 MacIntyre's Epistemological Crisis Framework

The most systematic philosophical framework for understanding tradition breakdown comes from Alasdair MacIntyre's account of epistemological crises. MacIntyre (1977) argues that traditions of inquiry face fundamental challenges when their existing conceptual resources prove inadequate to solve problems or make sense of new experiences. Such crises unfold through three stages: an initial period of coherence where the tradition's core commitments enable productive inquiry; a breakdown phase when anomalies accumulate faster than the tradition can absorb them; and finally, either resolution through narrative reconstruction or terminal collapse.

The epistemological crisis concept draws on but extends Thomas Kuhn's account of scientific revolutions. Where Kuhn focused primarily on paradigm shifts within scientific communities, MacIntyre (1988) generalizes the framework to encompass moral, political, and cultural traditions. In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, he traces four major intellectual traditions—Homeric, Aristotelian, Augustinian, and Scottish Enlightenment—demonstrating how each faced moments of crisis requiring fundamental reconceptualization. The crucial insight is that traditions can be rationally evaluated precisely through such crises: a tradition demonstrates its vitality by constructing narratives that explain both its prior success and the nature of the crisis itself.

Kuna (2005) addresses the relativist challenge this framework seems to invite. If reasoning occurs within traditions, how can we compare them? MacIntyre's response, Kuna argues, is that traditions can be rationally compared when one proves capable of resolving crises that another cannot. A tradition that successfully navigates epistemological crisis while a rival tradition stagnates has demonstrated rational superiority—not from a tradition-neutral standpoint (which MacIntyre denies exists), but through its superior problem-solving capacity. This matters for understanding breakdown: traditions fail not merely because they encounter difficulties, but because they cannot develop the conceptual resources needed to overcome them.

Angier (2014) systematizes MacIntyre's often-scattered remarks on tradition, clarifying the criteria that distinguish living traditions from dead or degenerate ones. Living traditions sustain ongoing internal argument about what the tradition requires; they engage seriously with rival traditions; they can identify and address their own internal contradictions. Dead traditions, by contrast, ossify into dogmatism—unable to absorb criticism or acknowledge failures—or dissolve into incoherence when adherents abandon core commitments without constructing adequate replacements. The distinction is not merely descriptive but normative: traditions have an obligation to maintain the conditions for their own health.

Lutz (2019) deepens the analysis by emphasizing the narrative dimension of tradition-constituted rationality. Traditions are not simply collections of beliefs or practices but fundamentally narrative structures connecting past, present, and projected future. Epistemological crisis involves narrative collapse: the tradition can no longer tell a coherent story about itself, cannot explain how it arrived at its current predicament, cannot articulate a credible path forward. Resolution requires constructing a new narrative that makes the previous understanding and its failure intelligible. This explains why tradition breakdown is so disorienting—it threatens not just particular beliefs but the intelligibility of one's situation within an ongoing story.

### 2.2 Institutional and Sociological Dimensions

MacIntyre's epistemological focus, while philosophically sophisticated, requires supplementation with attention to the institutional and sociological conditions that traditions depend upon. Edward Shils's (1981) comprehensive treatment emphasizes that traditions are not self-sustaining conceptual structures but require institutional bearers and cultural reproduction mechanisms. Breakdown can occur not only through conceptual failure but through the collapse of the institutions that transmit tradition across generations.

Jacobs (2007) identifies four distinct perspectives operating within Shils's work, each implying different criteria for tradition failure. The *pragmatic* perspective views traditions as useful social coordination mechanisms; they fail when they no longer solve practical problems. The *Burkean* perspective sees traditions as embodying accumulated wisdom; they fail when connection to this wisdom severs. The *veridical* perspective treats traditions as potentially truth-bearing; they fail when they distort rather than convey truth. The *evolutionist* perspective understands traditions as adapted practices; they fail when environmental changes render them maladaptive. These perspectives are complementary rather than competing—a comprehensive account of tradition breakdown must attend to all four dimensions.

The institutional emphasis highlights vulnerabilities that purely epistemological accounts may miss. Traditions require bearers—individuals and institutions that actively transmit practices, beliefs, and norms across generations. When these bearers disappear or cease transmission, traditions can die even if their conceptual content remains coherent. The institutional perspective also reveals how traditions can be weakened through disconnection from practice: when traditions become objects of academic study rather than lived commitments, their character changes fundamentally.

Spengler (1926), though philosophically controversial, provides an influential framework for understanding cultural decline that has shaped subsequent tradition theory. His distinction between creative "culture" and ossified "civilization" parallels the living/dead tradition distinction. While his biological determinism and cyclical inevitability claims have been widely rejected, his phenomenology of cultural vitality loss—the replacement of organic creativity with mechanical repetition, spiritual depth with technical proficiency—captures something real about how traditions can hollow out while maintaining external form.

Herman (1997) traces the intellectual history of declinist thought, showing recurring patterns in how Western thinkers have theorized cultural breakdown. Bennett (2008) examines contemporary cultural pessimism, noting a crucial paradox: narratives of decline may themselves contribute to the breakdown they diagnose. When cultural participants lose confidence in the value and transmissibility of their traditions, this pessimism can become self-fulfilling. The dialectical relationship between decline narratives and actual decline complicates any simple diagnosis of tradition pathology.

### 2.3 Living vs. Dead Traditions: Criteria for Health

The metaphor of "living" versus "dead" traditions pervades discussion of tradition breakdown, but precise analytical criteria remain elusive. Beckstein (2017) offers the most systematic recent attempt, arguing that living traditions exhibit four interrelated features. First, they sustain ongoing internal debate about their core commitments and what these commitments require in practice. Second, they demonstrate capacity for creative adaptation—changing in response to new circumstances while maintaining continuity with their past. Third, they involve authentic continuation rather than mere repetition—participants engage substantively with inherited material rather than simply reproducing it mechanically. Fourth, participants are actively engaged rather than passively inheriting—tradition is something done, not merely received.

These criteria help diagnose different pathologies. A tradition can die through ossification: internal debate ceases, creativity gives way to repetition, engagement becomes passive reception. It can also die through dissolution: debate becomes so fractious that continuity breaks down, adaptation becomes abandonment, and the tradition loses coherent identity. Both represent failures of the living tradition's essential balance between continuity and change.

Hollenbach (2019) draws a crucial distinction between "living tradition" and "traditionalism," which he characterizes (following Jaroslav Pelikan) as "the dead faith of the living" contrasted with "the living faith of the dead." Traditionalism involves rigid adherence to past formulations without creative engagement—treating inherited material as unchangeable deposit rather than living resource. Importantly, traditionalism often emerges precisely when traditions feel threatened: the defensive posture that refuses adaptation actually accelerates decline by blocking the creative development living traditions require.

Alexander's (2012; 2015) comparative analysis of Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre reveals that even philosophers who valorize tradition disagree fundamentally about what tradition breakdown means. Arendt sees the "break in tradition" as accomplished fact—modern political experience has ruptured continuity with the past, and no return is possible. Oakeshott, by contrast, holds that tradition is inevitably present in all human activity; the appearance of breakdown is an illusion produced by rationalist ideology. MacIntyre occupies a middle position: tradition is genuinely endangered by modernity's fragmentation, but recoverable through conscious adherence to practices that embody traditional rationality. These different diagnoses imply different prescriptions: if Arendt is right, we must think without tradition's guidance; if Oakeshott is right, we need only recognize tradition's inescapability; if MacIntyre is right, we must actively rebuild traditional communities of practice.

Zhavoronkov (2018) adds an important dimension by examining how appeals to "tradition" can mask anti-traditional nihilism. Drawing on Arendt's analysis of totalitarianism, he shows how radical conservative movements invoke tradition while actually destroying its conditions of possibility. Pseudo-traditions emerge: superficial invocations of traditional forms that serve ideological purposes while emptying those forms of genuine content. Traditions can thus fail not only by dying out but by being corrupted into simulacra—maintaining appearance while losing substance.

### 2.4 Hermeneutic Failure and Transmission Breakdown

Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics provides complementary resources for understanding tradition breakdown. Where MacIntyre emphasizes epistemological crisis, Gadamer (2006) frames tradition as ongoing dialogue between past and present, mediated through effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte). Understanding requires both distance from and belonging to tradition; the interpreter stands within effective history while also encountering tradition as something foreign that challenges present assumptions. Gander (2004) explicates how this tension between strangeness and familiarity is productive rather than problematic—it enables the "fusion of horizons" that constitutes genuine understanding.

Odenstedt (2017) applies this framework to diagnose tradition's transformation in modernity. The "decline of tradition" involves not disappearance but a qualitative shift in how tradition operates. Pre-modern traditions functioned through relatively organic transmission—participants simply inhabited their traditions without reflexive awareness that they were doing so. Modernity introduces reflexive self-consciousness: we become aware of traditions as traditions, as historical inheritances that could have been otherwise. This awareness alters tradition's character, requiring explicit reconstruction where once implicit transmission sufficed. Traditions become objects of choice rather than simply givens.

This hermeneutic perspective reveals tradition breakdown as failure of dialogical engagement. Traditions remain living when participants engage them interpretively—questioning, appropriating, applying inherited material to new situations. When the hermeneutic circle closes prematurely—when interpretation becomes dogmatic repetition rather than genuine dialogue—tradition dies even if its external forms persist. The circularity of interpretation (understanding parts through wholes and wholes through parts) must remain open to revision; when it closes, tradition ossifies.

The social epistemology of knowledge transmission extends these insights. Greco (2020) analyzes knowledge transmission as distinct from generation, emphasizing that transmission depends on interpersonal trust and cooperative social structures. McMyler (2022) argues that cultural knowledge transmission extends beyond paradigmatic testimony to include non-testimonial forms of learning: imitation, emulation, guided practice, ritual participation. Traditions transmit not only explicit beliefs but tacit knowledge embedded in practices. Muller (2024) develops this further through the concept of "cumulative cultural knowledge"—knowledge that accumulates across generations through refinement and transmission, exceeding what any individual could generate alone.

This literature suggests tradition breakdown can occur through disruption of any transmission channel. Testimonial failure—when explicit teachings lose credibility or cease being passed on—is only one possibility. Traditions also fail when participatory practices are disrupted, when ritual contexts that transmit tacit knowledge disappear, when trust between generations erodes. The hermeneutic and social-epistemological perspectives thus reveal tradition breakdown as not merely conceptual failure but practical disruption—the collapse of the interpretive communities and cooperative structures through which traditions live.

### 2.5 Political Traditions and Legitimacy

Political traditions face distinctive challenges related to authority, legitimacy, and democratic accountability. Wall (2016) examines whether and when traditions possess authority in political morality. He distinguishes epistemic authority—traditions may track truth about political goods through accumulated experience—from practical authority—traditions coordinate action and sustain valuable practices regardless of their truth-tracking capacity. Both forms of authority are genuine but defeasible; they must be balanced against independent moral considerations and can be overridden when traditions prove oppressive or mistaken.

This analysis illuminates how political traditions can fail differently than purely cultural ones. A political tradition might lose epistemic authority if it no longer tracks political goods—if its inherited wisdom becomes obsolete or systematically distorted. It might lose practical authority if it can no longer coordinate action effectively—if participants no longer recognize its claims as binding. Either form of authority loss represents tradition breakdown, but they require different responses and may occur independently.

Stout (2003) complicates any simple opposition between democracy and tradition by arguing that democratic discourse is itself a tradition. Democracy absorbs and transforms inherited practices rather than rejecting them; it represents a distinctive way of negotiating among multiple traditions within pluralistic societies. This suggests political tradition breakdown might involve not the victory of democracy over tradition but the failure of democratic tradition itself—the loss of those practices through which citizens negotiate their differences and transmit democratic commitments across generations.

Bellamy (2007) develops political constitutionalism as an alternative to legal constitutionalism, emphasizing that constitutional norms emerge from and are sustained by democratic political contestation rather than being imposed by courts. Constitutional traditions are living practices embodied in democratic institutions, not fixed texts requiring judicial interpretation. This framework helps explain how constitutional traditions can degenerate: when political contestation gives way to judicial settlement, when constitutional meaning becomes fixed rather than evolving through practice, the living dimension of constitutional tradition atrophies.

Church (1999) applies MacIntyre's framework directly to American constitutional tradition, arguing it has entered epistemological crisis. Core constitutional commitments—individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty—have become mutually incoherent when applied to contemporary problems. The endless controversy that characterizes constitutional debate signals not healthy disagreement but breakdown: the tradition can no longer resolve disputes using its internal resources. Whether resolution is possible, Church argues, requires narrative reconstruction that makes previous constitutional understandings and their failure intelligible.

Lukic (2023) extends this analysis through the concept of "intelligibility crisis," applying it to Yugoslav political tradition. When political narratives collapse, people lose the capacity to make sense of their situation—they cannot connect meaningfully to new contexts because their previous narrative framework has disintegrated. Political tradition breakdown thus involves not just institutional failure but loss of the narrative coherence that made political life intelligible. The Yugoslav case illustrates how rapidly such collapse can occur and how profoundly disorienting it proves for those who lived within the tradition.

Buchanan (2003) and Beetham (1991) remind us that traditional authority alone cannot ground political legitimacy. Even well-functioning political traditions require independent moral justification; legitimacy demands not merely that power be exercised according to tradition but that the tradition itself be morally defensible. Rosenfeld (2009) explores how constitutional identity is constructed through interplay of inherited traditions and constitutional commitments to equality and pluralism—a construction requiring both continuity with tradition and critical distance from it. Political traditions thus face a distinctive legitimacy burden that cultural traditions may escape.

### Section Summary

Tradition breakdown emerges from this analysis as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework identifies conceptual failure: traditions break down when their existing resources cannot solve problems or make sense of experience, and when they cannot construct narratives that explain their crisis. The institutional perspective adds sociological dimensions: traditions depend on bearers and transmission mechanisms whose collapse can destroy traditions even if their conceptual content remains viable. The living/dead tradition distinction provides criteria for assessing tradition health—internal debate, creative adaptation, authentic engagement—and reveals how traditions can die through both ossification and dissolution. Hermeneutic and social-epistemological approaches reveal tradition as interpretive practice; breakdown involves the closure of dialogical engagement and disruption of transmission channels beyond explicit testimony. Political traditions face additional vulnerabilities related to authority and legitimacy that pure cultural traditions may not share.

These perspectives are interconnected rather than competing. Epistemological crisis often produces institutional stress; institutional failure can precipitate conceptual incoherence; hermeneutic closure may reflect or cause both. A comprehensive understanding of tradition breakdown requires attending to all these dimensions while recognizing that different traditions may be more vulnerable to different pathologies. The literature provides rich resources for diagnosing tradition failure, though application to concrete political and cultural traditions remains underdeveloped.


## Research Gaps and Opportunities

The literature reviewed thus far reveals a paradox: while philosophical attention to tradition's value and the mechanisms of its breakdown has deepened considerably since MacIntyre's seminal work, systematic analysis of tradition failure remains fragmented across multiple disciplinary conversations that rarely engage one another. Four significant gaps emerge from this synthesis, each representing an opportunity for the proposed research to advance our philosophical understanding of how traditions can become defective.

### Gap 1: Criteria for Distinguishing Healthy from Corrupt Traditions

The distinction between "living" and "dead" traditions pervades the literature, yet the criteria for drawing this distinction remain surprisingly underdeveloped. Beckstein (2017) offers the most systematic recent treatment, proposing that living traditions exhibit ongoing internal debate, capacity for creative adaptation while maintaining continuity, authentic continuation rather than mere repetition, and active engagement by participants. Yet these criteria, while illuminating, retain a somewhat metaphorical quality that resists precise application. When exactly does "creative adaptation" cross into abandonment? How much "internal debate" signals health versus dissolution?

The difficulty becomes more apparent when examining how major traditionalist thinkers themselves disagree on what tradition health means. As Alexander (2012, 2015) demonstrates, Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre offer fundamentally incompatible diagnoses: Arendt sees tradition as irretrievably broken by modernity's revolutions, Oakeshott sees tradition as inevitably operative in all human activity, and MacIntyre sees tradition as endangered but recoverable through conscious adherence. These rival views imply radically different accounts of what tradition breakdown means and whether it is even possible. If Oakeshott is correct that we cannot escape tradition, then "breakdown" must mean something quite different than if Arendt is correct that genuine tradition has already ended.

The theological literature offers suggestive resources. Hollenbach (2019) distinguishes "living tradition" from "traditionalism"---the latter being "the dead faith of the living" characterized by rigid adherence to past formulas without creative engagement. Angier (2014), explicating MacIntyre, emphasizes the capacity for self-criticism, engagement with rival traditions, and ability to identify and resolve internal contradictions as marks of tradition health. Yet neither offers operationalizable standards that could guide assessment of actual political or cultural traditions. The research project can address this gap by synthesizing MacIntyre's epistemological criteria, Beckstein's practice-based criteria, and hermeneutic criteria of dialogical openness versus closure into a more rigorous analytical framework.

### Gap 2: Mechanisms of Tradition Failure (Not Just Symptoms)

The existing literature better diagnoses tradition breakdown than explains its causes. MacIntyre's (1977) epistemological crisis framework provides the most systematic philosophical account: traditions fail when their existing conceptual resources prove inadequate to solve problems or make sense of new experiences. Yet this framework, while powerful, focuses primarily on internal conceptual failure. It has less to say about the sociological, institutional, and practical mechanisms that cause traditions to enter crisis in the first place.

Jacobs (2007), explicating Shils, identifies multiple perspectives on tradition failure that are not fully integrated: traditions may fail pragmatically (when they no longer solve problems), in Burkean terms (when connection to past wisdom severs), veridically (when they distort truth), or evolutionarily (when they become maladaptive). These different perspectives imply different failure criteria and different intervention points, yet the literature lacks a framework for understanding how these mechanisms interact.

The social epistemology literature reveals additional transmission mechanisms largely absent from philosophical discussions. Greco (2020) shows how knowledge transmission depends on interpersonal trust and cooperative social structures. McMyler (2022) demonstrates that traditions transmit knowledge through both testimonial and non-testimonial learning---imitation, guided practice, ritual participation. Breakdown can occur through disruption of any of these channels. When trust erodes, when participatory practices fragment, when interpretive communities dissolve, traditions fail not through conceptual inadequacy but through practical transmission failure. The research project can integrate MacIntyre's epistemological focus with these sociological and social-epistemological perspectives to provide a more complete account of breakdown mechanisms rather than merely symptoms.

### Gap 3: Political vs. Cultural Tradition Distinction

The literature rarely distinguishes systematically between political and cultural traditions, yet these face distinctly different challenges and exhibit different vulnerabilities. Wall (2016) provides the most careful analysis of tradition's political authority, distinguishing epistemic authority (traditions track truth about political goods) from practical authority (traditions coordinate action and sustain valuable practices). This distinction is crucial because political traditions must ground authority and legitimacy in ways that purely cultural traditions need not.

Bellamy (2007) argues that constitutional traditions are living practices embodied in democratic institutions rather than fixed legal texts. Constitutional norms emerge from political contestation rather than transcending political practice. This implies that political traditions face unique vulnerabilities related to democratic accountability and legitimacy that cultural traditions may avoid. When political traditions lose the capacity to command assent, they face legitimation crises that cultural traditions may weather differently.

Church (1999) applies MacIntyre's framework to American constitutionalism, diagnosing an epistemological crisis in which core commitments---individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty---have become incoherent when applied to contemporary problems. Rosenfeld (2009) examines how constitutional identity navigates tensions between inherited traditions and constitutional commitments to equality and pluralism. Yet despite these valuable contributions, Buchanan (2003) reminds us that traditional authority alone is insufficient for political legitimacy without independent moral justification. Political traditions require additional grounding that purely cultural traditions may not need.

The research project can address this gap by developing a typology distinguishing political from cultural traditions and examining their different vulnerabilities to breakdown. Political traditions face challenges from democratic contestation, legitimacy requirements, and constitutional identity that create distinctive failure modes not present in cultural traditions.

### Gap 4: Tradition-Internal vs. External Critique

The literature presents two broadly different accounts of how traditions fail or are challenged, yet the relationship between these modes remains undertheorized. On one hand, MacIntyre's (1977, 1988) epistemological crisis represents internal failure---traditions encounter problems their own conceptual resources cannot solve. On the other hand, critical perspectives from liberal, feminist, and critical theory standpoints critique tradition from external standpoints grounded in reason, autonomy, or justice.

The most sophisticated work in this area suggests these modes are not simply opposed. Lee (2023) surveys relational autonomy theories that show how agency can operate within rather than merely against traditional frameworks. Relational accounts capture how social contexts constitute agency while distinguishing between social phenomena that enhance versus hinder autonomy. Zion-Waldoks (2014) demonstrates empirically how feminist resistance can operate as "devoted resistance"---critique within relationship to tradition, enabled by cultural schema and comprising both interpretive skills and relational autonomy capacities.

Folkers (2015), examining Foucault's genealogy of critique, shows how critical practice can question the power effects of rationality itself without assuming an external rational standpoint. This suggests that the tradition-versus-critique dichotomy may itself be too simple: traditions contain resources for their own reformation, while critique is always situated within some tradition or another.

Whether tradition breakdown comes from internal incoherence or external challenge matters fundamentally for understanding what constitutes failure versus creative development. A tradition that transforms under external pressure may be demonstrating healthy adaptation; alternatively, it may be succumbing to forces that destroy its identity. The research project can address this gap by distinguishing internal mechanisms of tradition failure (epistemological crisis, ossification, transmission breakdown) from external challenges (critique, competition from rival traditions, changing social conditions), while recognizing that this distinction is itself complex and permeable.

### Synthesis: The Underdevelopment of Breakdown Analysis

These four gaps collectively reveal that despite substantial literature on tradition's value and on critical perspectives, the philosophical analysis of tradition breakdown remains underdeveloped. The literature excels at defending tradition (conservative approaches) or critiquing it (liberal and critical approaches), but struggles to provide systematic accounts of how traditions actually fail, degenerate, or become corrupt.

This lacuna has practical significance. Without clear criteria for tradition health, we cannot assess whether a particular tradition is evolving healthily or degenerating. Without understanding mechanisms of failure, we cannot distinguish normal challenges (which living traditions overcome) from terminal crises (which mark tradition collapse). Without distinguishing political from cultural traditions, we miss how different types face different vulnerabilities. And without integrating internal and external perspectives on critique, we cannot determine when transformation represents authentic development versus abandonment.

The research project addresses these gaps by synthesizing disparate literatures into an integrated account of tradition breakdown. It aims to provide clearer criteria for distinguishing healthy from pathological traditions, articulate mechanisms (not just symptoms) of tradition failure, develop a typology of political versus cultural tradition vulnerabilities, and integrate internal and external perspectives on how traditions can be challenged, reformed, or destroyed. Such an account would contribute not only to political philosophy but to practical questions about which traditions deserve preservation, which require reform, and which should be abandoned.


## Conclusion

This review has traced the philosophical terrain surrounding tradition's value and vulnerability, revealing both the conceptual richness of the phenomenon and the significant gaps in our understanding of how traditions fail. The literature situates tradition as a contested concept occupying an intermediate space between simple conventions and fully institutionalized structures: unlike Lewis's (1969) coordination equilibria, traditions require temporal extension, intergenerational transmission, and criteria for authentic continuation that practitioners themselves recognize and contest (Beckstein 2017). This conceptual positioning matters because different understandings of what traditions are imply different accounts of how they can go wrong.

The normative debate between conservative and critical perspectives emerges as genuine but not zero-sum. Conservative philosophers from Burke through MacIntyre (1984) and Horcher (2020) have articulated sophisticated epistemic arguments: traditions embody accumulated practical wisdom that exceeds individual rational capacity, while providing the narrative contexts within which practical reasoning becomes possible. Yet critical perspectives from the Enlightenment through contemporary feminism identify real dangers: traditions can perpetuate heteronomy and oppression, constraining rather than enabling autonomous agency (Beiser 1996; Ikuta 2020). The most productive approaches recognize this tension rather than resolving it one-sidedly. Relational autonomy theories (Lee 2023; Deveaux 2006; Zion-Waldoks 2014) demonstrate that agency can operate within rather than merely against traditional frameworks, while Horkheimer and Adorno (2020) show that pure anti-traditionalism generates its own forms of domination. The sophisticated positions on both sides converge on viewing tradition as both enabling and constraining.

MacIntyre's (1977; 1988) epistemological crisis framework provides the most systematic philosophical account of tradition breakdown, explaining how traditions fail when their existing conceptual resources prove inadequate to solve problems or make sense of new experiences. His distinction between living traditions, which sustain internal debate and creative adaptation, and dead traditions, which ossify into mere traditionalism or dissolve into incoherence, offers analytical purchase on the phenomenon of degeneration. Yet MacIntyre's philosophical focus requires supplementation. Shils's (1981) sociological emphasis on institutional bearers and cultural reproduction mechanisms reveals how traditions depend on concrete social structures for transmission (Jacobs 2007). Gadamer's hermeneutic rehabilitation of tradition (Warnke 1987) illuminates the interpretive practices through which meaning transmits across generations, while Wall (2016) and Bellamy (2007) examine the specific challenges political traditions face in grounding authority and legitimacy within democratic frameworks.

The synthesis of these disparate literatures reveals a central insight: living traditions sustain internal debate and creative adaptation while maintaining continuity; dead traditions ossify into rigid traditionalism or dissolve into incoherence (Beckstein 2017; Hollenbach 2019). The challenge lies in distinguishing healthy evolution from degeneration, a task for which current frameworks provide only partial guidance. This project's contribution lies in integrating philosophical, sociological, hermeneutic, and political perspectives into a more comprehensive account of what makes traditions valuable, how they can fail, and what criteria might distinguish authentic development from pathological transformation.

The implications for political philosophy are substantial. Political traditions face specific challenges absent from purely cultural traditions: they must ground authority and legitimacy, accommodate democratic contestation, and maintain constitutional identity across changing circumstances (Wall 2016; Church 1999). When political traditions break down, the result is not merely loss of particular practices but a crisis of intelligibility that threatens the possibility of coherent political life itself (Lukic 2023). Understanding how such breakdown occurs, and whether it can be averted or remedied, remains essential for navigating the contemporary challenges confronting political and cultural traditions alike.
