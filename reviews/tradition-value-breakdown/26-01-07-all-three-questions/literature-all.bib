DOMAIN: Conceptual Analysis of Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 5, Medium: 6, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The conceptual analysis of tradition remains surprisingly under-developed
in contemporary analytic philosophy, despite tradition's centrality to
social and political philosophy. The domain divides into three main
approaches: (1) Lewis-inspired convention theory that treats traditions
as coordination equilibria; (2) social ontology approaches examining
traditions as practices, norms, or institutions; and (3) direct
conceptual analysis attempting to define tradition and distinguish it
from related phenomena.

Key debates center on: whether traditions are essentially temporally
extended (requiring transmission across generations); whether they are
primarily normative (prescribing action) or descriptive (patterns of
behavior); and how to distinguish traditions from customs, conventions,
habits, and institutions. Beckstein (2017) provides the most systematic
recent treatment, arguing that traditions must exhibit both continuity
and authentic continuation criteria. Shils (1981) remains foundational
despite being sociological rather than strictly philosophical. The SEP
entries on convention (Lewis, Marmor), social norms (Bicchieri), and
social institutions (Searle, Miller) provide rich conceptual resources
but rarely address tradition directly.

Recent work shows renewed interest in tradition's role in practical
rationality (MacIntyre's influence persists) and in political philosophy
(debates over conservatism, multiculturalism). However, there remains
no consensus "theory of tradition" comparable to Lewis on convention or
Searle on institutions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential conceptual foundations for understanding
what traditions ARE before investigating their value or breakdown. The
distinction between traditions and mere customs/conventions matters
critically: if traditions require authentic continuation and meaningful
transmission (not just behavioral repetition), then questions of
degeneration become more tractable. The temporal extension requirement
connects to issues of tradition identity over time—crucial for asking
when a tradition has "failed" versus merely evolved.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Surprisingly little work directly engages the ontology of traditions.
Most philosophical work treats traditions as examples within broader
theories (of convention, practice, social ontology) rather than
analyzing the concept itself. The relationship between tradition and
temporal extension needs more rigorous treatment. Very limited engagement
with cross-cultural conceptions of tradition beyond Western philosophy.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Begin with Lewis/convention theory to establish baseline (traditions as
regularity + common knowledge), then examine why this is insufficient
(Beckstein's critique). Use Shils for typology and MacIntyre for
practice-based alternative. SEP entries provide the broader conceptual
landscape (institutions, practices, norms) within which traditions sit.
The synthesis should emphasize that conceptual clarity here is
prerequisite to normative analysis in other domains.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Convention-theoretic: 4 papers - Traditions as coordination equilibria (Lewis, Marmor)
- Practice-based: 5 papers - Traditions as practices requiring transmission (MacIntyre, Beckstein)
- Social ontology: 6 papers - Traditions as social institutions/norms (Searle, Tuomela, Miller)

DOMAIN: Conservative Philosophical Defenses of Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers philosophical arguments defending the value and authority
of tradition from a conservative perspective. The central debate concerns
whether traditions embody accumulated wisdom that transcends individual
reason, and how traditions ground practical reason and moral judgment.

Key figures include Edmund Burke (founder of modern conservatism), Michael
Oakeshott (critic of rationalism in politics), Alasdair MacIntyre (virtue
ethics and tradition-constituted rationality), and contemporary thinkers
like Roger Scruton and Ferenc Horcher. The domain encompasses both
epistemological arguments (tradition as wisdom) and identity-based arguments
(tradition as constitutive of self and community).

Major positions include: (1) Burkean skepticism of abstract rationalism
favoring inherited wisdom, (2) Oakeshott's critique of "rationalism in
politics" emphasizing tacit practical knowledge, (3) MacIntyre's
neo-Aristotelian account of practices and narrative identity embedded in
traditions, (4) communitarian defenses emphasizing tradition's role in
constituting identity.

Recent work examines tensions between conservative and liberal traditions,
the epistemic status of tradition, and whether conservative philosophy
constitutes a coherent doctrine or merely a dispositional stance.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses arguments FOR tradition, providing the
counter-position to critical and reformist views. Understanding conservative
defenses is essential for analyzing when and why traditions fail, as
conservatives emphasize tradition's resilience and adaptive capacity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with empirical studies of tradition breakdown. Few
papers address the conservative response to tradition degeneration. More
work needed on epistemic arguments (Chesterton's fence) beyond MacIntyre.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare epistemic (tradition as accumulated wisdom) versus identity-based
(tradition as constitutive) arguments. Note tensions between different
conservative traditions. Examine what conservatives say about tradition
failure or corruption.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Burkean traditionalism: 7 papers - Skepticism of abstract reason, emphasis on inherited wisdom
- Oakeshott's anti-rationalism: 5 papers - Critique of technical knowledge in politics
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics: 4 papers - Tradition-constituted rationality, narrative unity
- Communitarian defenses: 2 papers - Traditions constitute identity and community

DOMAIN: Critical and Liberal Perspectives on Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses critiques of tradition from Enlightenment, liberal,
feminist, and critical theory perspectives. The Enlightenment tradition,
exemplified by Kant's call to "dare to know" (sapere aude), positioned
reason against traditional authority, viewing traditions as potentially
irrational constraints on individual autonomy. Liberal theorists from Mill
to Rawls have grappled with the tension between individual liberty and
traditional social structures, particularly examining how customs and
inherited practices can become instruments of social tyranny. Feminist
philosophers have subjected traditions to sustained critique as mechanisms
of patriarchal oppression, questioning how gendered practices and norms
constrain women's autonomy. Critical theorists, especially the Frankfurt
School, have analyzed how Enlightenment reason itself can become
instrumental and dominating. Recent work has complicated these critiques
through relational conceptions of autonomy that acknowledge how traditions
both constitute and constrain agency.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the normative evaluation of traditions
central to the project. It provides theoretical frameworks for assessing
when traditions become oppressive or irrational, and for understanding the
conditions under which traditions conflict with individual autonomy. These
critiques also establish standards for identifying tradition breakdown or
degeneration.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on feminist and liberal critiques, there is
less philosophical analysis of how traditions can be reformed from within
versus abandoned entirely. The relationship between tradition critique and
tradition preservation remains undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should map the different axes of critique (epistemological,
political, feminist) and examine how they converge or diverge. Special
attention should be paid to how relational autonomy approaches attempt to
bridge the tradition-autonomy divide, and to Habermas's effort to preserve
emancipatory critique while avoiding totalizing instrumental reason.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment Critique (Kant, Beiser): 5 papers - Tradition as
  heteronomy vs. rational autonomy
- Liberal Theory (Mill, Rawls): 4 papers - Individual liberty and social
  tyranny of custom
- Feminist Critique (Okin, MacKinnon, relational autonomy): 5 papers -
  Tradition as patriarchal oppression
- Critical Theory (Frankfurt School, Habermas, Foucault): 4 papers -

DOMAIN: Tradition in Political Philosophy

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how traditions function within political theory,
particularly regarding political authority, legitimacy, constitutions,
and democratic governance. A central tension runs through the literature
between traditionalist and constitutionalist approaches: traditionalists
(exemplified by Burke and Oakeshott) emphasize inherited practices and
institutional wisdom, while constitutionalists focus on formal legal
limits and rational principles. Recent work explores how constitutional
traditions differ from cultural traditions, how civic republican
traditions understand political participation, and whether democratic
self-governance can be grounded in or reconciled with inherited
traditions. The literature also addresses founding myths, constitutional
identity, and the relationship between tradition and reform.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses how political traditions ground authority
and legitimacy, providing essential context for understanding when and
why political traditions succeed or fail. The tension between tradition
and rational reform illuminates conditions under which traditions
degenerate. Work on constitutional traditions reveals how formal
political structures depend on informal traditional practices.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While substantial work exists on tradition as a source of legitimacy,
less attention has been paid to the mechanisms by which political
traditions decay or lose legitimacy. The relationship between tradition
and populist challenges to democratic norms is an emerging area. Few
papers explicitly theorize the distinction between healthy and
degenerating political traditions.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Contrast traditionalist approaches (Burke, Oakeshott) with
constitutionalist critiques (Bellamy). Examine how Wall's analysis of
tradition's authority relates to questions of political legitimacy.
Consider Stout's synthesis of democratic and traditional values. Note
how republican tradition (Pocock, Pettit) offers a middle path between
pure traditionalism and pure constitutionalism.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Traditionalist conservatism: 2 papers - Appeal to inherited wisdom and skepticism of abstract rationalism
- Liberal constitutionalism: 3 papers - Emphasis on formal legal limits and democratic legitimacy
- Civic republicanism: 3 papers - Tradition of civic virtue and non-domination
- Critical perspectives: 2 papers - Interrogate how traditions function in political justification
- Constitutional theory: 2 papers - How constitutional traditions differ from other traditions

DOMAIN: Theories of Tradition Breakdown and Degeneration
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 8, Low: 4)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses explicit theoretical accounts of HOW and WHY traditions fail,
degenerate, become corrupt, ossified, or lose vitality. The core theoretical framework
comes from Alasdair MacIntyre's account of epistemological crises in traditions, which
argues that traditions face breakdown when they encounter problems their existing
conceptual resources cannot solve. MacIntyre distinguishes "living traditions" (which
sustain ongoing internal debate and development) from "dead" or ossified ones (which
become rigid, cease self-criticism, and degenerate into mere "traditionalism").

Complementing MacIntyre's philosophical analysis, sociological theories from Edward Shils
and anthropological work examine how traditions lose vitality through: (1) corruption of
their internal standards and purposes; (2) ossification into rigid forms disconnected from
living practice; (3) transformation from genuine tradition into mere "traditionalism"
(unreflective adherence to past forms); and (4) failure to sustain the reflexive
self-consciousness necessary for tradition health. Recent work extends these analyses to
cultural decline more broadly, examining theories of decadence, civilizational breakdown,
and the pathologies that emerge when reflexive traditionalism replaces living tradition.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the third research question on how traditions degenerate or
fail. It provides the theoretical vocabulary for distinguishing healthy from pathological
forms of tradition, and offers philosophical frameworks for understanding what makes
traditions "living" versus "dead." This is likely the most innovative contribution of the
literature review, as systematic philosophical theories of tradition breakdown remain
underexplored despite their importance for political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework is well-developed, there is limited work
on applying it systematically to concrete political traditions. The distinction between
"living" and "dead" traditions remains somewhat metaphorical and could benefit from more
precise analytical criteria. Contemporary work on cultural decline often focuses on symptoms
rather than mechanisms of degeneration. The relationship between tradition breakdown and
political legitimacy deserves more sustained attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should begin with MacIntyre's core framework before expanding to sociological
and anthropological perspectives. Key debates to highlight: whether tradition breakdown is
primarily epistemological, sociological, or ethical in nature; whether "traditionalism" is
necessarily pathological; and how reflexive self-consciousness relates to tradition health.
The section should emphasize the innovative contribution of systematic theories of tradition
failure to political philosophy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- MacIntyrean epistemological crisis (6 papers): Tradition breakdown as conceptual failure
- Sociological theories of tradition (5 papers): Institutional and cultural degeneration
- Cultural decline and decadence (4 papers): Broader civilizational breakdown patterns
- Living vs. dead tradition (3 papers): Distinguishing healthy from ossified forms

DOMAIN: Hermeneutics and Social Epistemology of Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 6, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how traditions transmit knowledge and meaning across
generations through the lenses of philosophical hermeneutics and social
epistemology. Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy provides the foundational
framework, particularly his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority, and
tradition, and his concepts of effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte) and
the hermeneutic circle. These ideas challenge Enlightenment skepticism
toward tradition by showing how our historical situatedness enables rather
than impedes understanding. The hermeneutic circle—the interdependence of
part and whole in interpretation—reveals how tradition shapes our
pre-understanding while remaining open to revision through dialogical
encounter.

Recent work extends this hermeneutic foundation into social epistemology,
examining how cultural knowledge accumulates and transmits through both
testimonial and non-testimonial learning. Debates concern whether Gadamer's
account is inherently conservative, how testimony differs from other forms
of cultural learning, and whether traditions can be both authoritative and
subject to critical revision. The intersection with epistemology of
testimony raises questions about the unique epistemic status of
tradition-mediated knowledge versus other forms of social learning.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question of how traditions
function as vehicles for intergenerational knowledge transmission.
Gadamer's concepts of effective history and the hermeneutic circle provide
philosophical frameworks for understanding both the value of traditions
(their role in enabling understanding) and their potential defects (when
the hermeneutic circle becomes closed or distorted). The social
epistemology literature extends this by examining the social structures and
epistemic norms that govern tradition transmission, helping to explain how
traditions can maintain authority while also becoming defective or breaking
down.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition is well-covered, less work
explicitly theorizes the conditions under which traditions fail, degenerate,
or become pathological. The social epistemology literature focuses more on
successful transmission than on breakdown mechanisms. More work needed on
the intersection between hermeneutic accounts of tradition and empirical
studies of cultural transmission failure.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, emphasize how Gadamer's hermeneutic concepts provide
philosophical grounding for understanding tradition's epistemic value, then
show how social epistemology work extends this by examining the social
conditions and practices of transmission. The debate over whether Gadamer's
view is inherently conservative connects to questions about how traditions
can change or become defective. Consider contrasting testimonial vs.
non-testimonial cultural learning as different modes of tradition
transmission with different vulnerabilities.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Gadamerian hermeneutics (6 papers): Tradition as enabling condition for
  understanding; effective history as dialogical engagement with past
- Social epistemology of transmission (5 papers): Focus on epistemic norms
  and social structures governing knowledge transmission
- Critical perspectives (4 papers): Questions about conservatism,
  authority, and the limits of tradition-based understanding

  title = {Convention: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {1969},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conventions are solutions to recurring coordination problems,
  sustained by common knowledge that everyone expects everyone else to conform.
  A convention is a regularity R in behavior such that: everyone conforms to R,
  everyone expects everyone else to conform to R, everyone prefers to conform to
  R on condition that others do, and there exists at least one alternative
  regularity that could serve the same function. This game-theoretic analysis
  provides necessary and sufficient conditions for conventional phenomena.

  RELEVANCE: Lewis provides the dominant analytical framework for understanding
  conventional phenomena. If traditions are a species of convention, they inherit
  this structure—implying traditions rest on coordination and mutual
  expectations rather than inherent authority or value. However, Lewis's account
  may be insufficient for traditions: conventions can arise quickly and
  dissolve easily, while traditions seem to require temporal extension and
  transmission. The project must examine whether traditions are conventions,
  sub-conventions, or distinct phenomena requiring different conceptual apparatus.

  POSITION: Foundational convention theory using game-theoretic analysis;

  number = {4},
  pages = {491--510},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditions are temporally extended practices characterized by
  (1) a pattern of transmission across generations, (2) continuity despite
  change, and (3) criteria for authentic continuation that practitioners
  recognize and contest. Beckstein argues that conventions (Lewis) and habits
  lack the necessary temporal extension and transmission structure. Traditions
  must allow for development while maintaining identity—hence "living"
  traditions. The concept requires distinguishing tradition-constitutive
  features from accidental historical accretions, but this distinction is
  itself contestable within the tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most systematic recent philosophical treatment of
  tradition as a concept. Beckstein directly addresses the project's central
  question: what makes something a tradition versus a custom or convention?
  His "living tradition" framework provides conceptual tools for analyzing
  tradition degeneration: a tradition fails when it loses authentic
  continuation (becomes ossified) or transmission breaks down. The emphasis
  on contestation within tradition is crucial for understanding how traditions
  evolve without losing identity. Essential for domain 1's conceptual analysis.

  argues for practice-based account with temporal extension as essential.

  author = {Shils, Edward},
  title = {Tradition},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditions are patterns of belief, practice, or institution
  that are handed down from the past and possess authority by virtue of their
  having been handed down. Shils provides a typology: substantive traditions
  (beliefs, practices) versus formal traditions (patterns of relationship),
  and varying orientations toward tradition (traditionalistic,
  traditionalist, antitraditional). Traditions function to connect present
  to past, providing continuity and identity. All societies contain multiple,
  often competing traditions; even "revolutionary" movements establish their
  own traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Though sociological rather than strictly philosophical, Shils
  remains the most comprehensive single-volume treatment of tradition. His
  typology illuminates how traditions operate across different domains (law,
  religion, science, politics). For the project, Shils's account of how
  traditions gain and lose authority is crucial—authority derives partly from
  pastness itself, but also from perceived continuity with valued origins.
  His analysis of "traditionalism" (rigid attachment to tradition) versus
  healthy tradition-maintenance informs questions of when traditions calcify
  versus adapt. Foundational text despite being 40+ years old.

  number = {2},
  pages = {139--162},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393107299685},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs provides critical exposition of Shils's multifaceted
  theory of tradition, identifying four distinct perspectives: pragmatic
  (traditions as solutions to recurrent problems), Burkean (traditions embody
  accumulated wisdom), veridical (traditions transmit truth/reality), and
  evolutionist (traditions as survival-tested practices). Jacobs argues these
  perspectives are not fully integrated in Shils's work, creating tensions—
  especially between the pragmatic view (traditions as contingent solutions)
  and the veridical view (traditions as truth-bearing).

  RELEVANCE: Essential secondary literature for understanding Shils's complex
  position. Jacobs's analysis reveals how even the most comprehensive theory
  of tradition contains unresolved conceptual tensions. For the project, this
  matters because different perspectives on tradition imply different criteria
  for failure/degeneration: pragmatic view suggests traditions fail when they
  no longer solve problems; veridical view suggests they fail when they
  distort truth; Burkean view suggests they fail when connection to past
  wisdom is severed. The project's theory of tradition-breakdown must
  address these distinct failure modes.

  tradition theory; important secondary literature on foundational text.

  author = {Marmor, Andrei},
  title = {Social Conventions: From Language to Law},
  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conventions are arbitrary behavioral regularities constituted
  by reasons for action that are both self-perpetuating and content-independent.
  Marmor distinguishes "shallow" conventions (Lewis-type coordination) from
  "deep" conventions (constitutive of practices like language, law). Deep
  conventions generate new reasons for action and cannot be easily changed
  by individual or even collective decision. Language is the paradigm case:
  linguistic conventions are arbitrary yet normatively binding, learned
  through participation rather than explicit agreement.

  RELEVANCE: Marmor's distinction between shallow and deep conventions is
  crucial for understanding traditions. If traditions are deep conventions,
  they possess normative force not reducible to coordination benefits, and
  their "arbitrariness" is compatible with their authority. This helps explain
  why traditions persist even when their original functions are unclear:
  they constitute practices we cannot easily exit. For tradition-breakdown,
  the question becomes: when do deep conventions lose their constitutive power?
  When participants no longer recognize them as authoritative, or when
  participation itself breaks down?

  POSITION: Extends Lewis's convention theory to "deep" conventions with
  constitutive rather than merely coordinative function; important for
  understanding tradition's normative force.

  author = {Searle, John R.},
  title = {The Construction of Social Reality},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Free Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social reality consists of institutional facts created by
  collective intentionality and constitutive rules of the form "X counts as Y
  in context C." Institutions are systems of such constitutive rules. Money,
  property, marriage, government all exemplify institutional facts: they exist
  only because we collectively accept them as existing and assign them
  status-functions. Collective intentionality (we-intentions) is primitive,
  not reducible to individual intentionality. Language is the fundamental
  social institution enabling all others.

  RELEVANCE: Searle provides the dominant analytical framework for social
  ontology of institutions. If traditions are social institutions (or contain
  institutional elements), they inherit this structure: collective acceptance
  creates institutional reality. However, Searle's account emphasizes synchronic
  structure (collective acceptance at t) while traditions essentially involve
  diachronic transmission. The project must examine: Are traditions institutions?
  Do they require special forms of collective intentionality oriented toward
  the past? How does collective acceptance of tradition differ from collective
  acceptance of current institutions? Searle rarely discusses tradition directly.

  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511616037},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social norms are behavioral rules supported by empirical
  and normative expectations: people follow norm N if they believe (1) others
  follow N (empirical expectation), (2) others expect them to follow N and
  may sanction non-compliance (normative expectation), and (3) they prefer
  to follow N conditional on (1) and (2). This distinguishes social norms
  from conventions (lack normative force), moral rules (independent of
  others' expectations), and descriptive norms (mere regularities). Social
  norms are self-enforcing through mutual expectations rather than external
  enforcement.

  RELEVANCE: Bicchieri's framework helps distinguish traditions from norms
  and conventions. Are traditions social norms? Partly: they involve normative
  expectations and sanctions for non-compliance. But traditions seem to involve
  additional elements: connection to the past, transmission, and claims to
  authority based on antiquity rather than just mutual expectations. For
  tradition-breakdown, Bicchieri's analysis of how norms unravel (when
  expectations become misaligned) may illuminate how traditions fail: when
  transmission breaks down, empirical and normative expectations diverge,
  undermining the norm.

  title = {The Moral Foundations of Social Institutions: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {2010},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social institutions are organizations or systems of
  organizations embodying collective ends pursued through joint activity
  according to constitutive and regulative rules. Institutions have both
  structure (roles, rules) and function (collective ends). Miller's teleological
  account emphasizes that institutions exist to serve collective ends—these
  ends provide both explanation and normative standard. Institutions require
  joint action (multiple agents acting interdependently toward shared goal)
  sustained across time through mechanisms ensuring coordination and
  perpetuation.

  RELEVANCE: Miller's teleological approach differs from Searle's constitutive-
  rule approach, emphasizing collective ends over collective acceptance. For
  traditions, this raises: Do traditions have collective ends? Or do they
  simply perpetuate practices whose original ends are lost? If traditions lack
  clear collective ends, Miller's framework may not apply. However, his
  emphasis on joint action sustained over time captures tradition's diachronic
  character better than Searle. For breakdown: traditions fail when collective
  ends become unclear or when joint action mechanisms fail to perpetuate
  the practice across generations.

  ends and joint action; alternative to Searle's constitutive-rule approach.

  author = {Gilbert, Margaret},
  title = {On Social Facts},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social phenomena require "plural subjects"—multiple persons
  constituting, by virtue of joint commitment, a single subject of attitudes
  and actions. Joint commitments create obligations among participants that
  individuals cannot unilaterally rescind. This differs from aggregate views
  (social facts = aggregated individual facts) and collective intentionality
  views (Searle). Gilbert emphasizes the normative structure: joint commitment
  creates obligations to each other, giving participants standing to rebuke
  non-compliance. Walking together, believing together, intending together
  all involve plural subject structure.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject theory may illuminate traditions as joint
  commitments extended across time: participants are jointly committed to
  maintaining and transmitting the practice, creating obligations to past and
  future participants. This explains tradition's normative force without appeal
  to inherent value—the force comes from joint commitment structure. For
  breakdown: traditions fail when joint commitments dissolve, when participants
  no longer recognize obligations to each other (past/future). However, Gilbert
  rarely discusses temporal extension or intergenerational joint commitments.

@book{tuomela2002philosophy,
  author = {Tuomela, Raimo},
  title = {The Philosophy of Social Practices: A Collective Acceptance View},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social practices are systems of rule-governed activities
  based on collective acceptance. Collective acceptance (accepting something
  "as a group") creates social reality through we-mode thinking (distinct
  from mere I-mode aggregation). Practices are ontologically collective:
  they exist only when collectively accepted and maintained. Tuomela
  distinguishes constitutive and regulative social practices, emphasizes
  positional roles and deontic powers, and argues we-mode collective
  acceptance is necessary for full-blooded social practices.

  RELEVANCE: Tuomela's collective acceptance view, like Searle's, emphasizes
  synchronic structure. For traditions, the question is whether collective
  acceptance must be oriented toward the past or whether present collective
  acceptance suffices. If tradition requires accepting something "because it
  was handed down," this involves distinct intentional content from accepting
  something for current reasons. Tuomela's framework illuminates how practices
  are collectively maintained but may need supplementation to handle diachronic
  transmission. For breakdown: traditions fail when collective acceptance
  lapses or shifts from we-mode to I-mode.

  POSITION: Collective acceptance theory emphasizing we-mode versus I-mode
  collective intentionality; social practices exist through being collectively

  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of philosophical theories of convention
  from Lewis through contemporary debates. Covers Lewis's game-theoretic
  analysis, criticisms emphasizing common knowledge requirements, alternative
  approaches (Millikan's copying account, evolutionary game theory), and
  applications to language. Key debate: whether conventions require common
  knowledge or merely sufficient mutual expectations for coordination. Also
  addresses relationship between conventions and norms, rules, and practices.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic overview of the convention-theoretic landscape
  within which any convention-based account of tradition must be situated.
  The article's discussion of how conventions relate to norms and practices
  is directly relevant: if traditions are conventions-plus-X, what is X?
  The tension between Lewis-style common knowledge requirements and more
  permissive accounts matters for traditions: do participants need common
  knowledge of tradition, or suffices that they participate without explicit
  awareness? Essential reference for positioning tradition relative to convention.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social norms are distinguished from conventions, moral norms,
  and descriptive regularities by their expectation structure: both empirical
  (beliefs about what others do) and normative (beliefs about what others
  expect and approve). Article surveys game-theoretic, evolutionary, and
  psychological approaches to norms. Discusses norm emergence, maintenance,
  and change; role of sanctions; relationship to social preferences. Key
  distinction: norms have intrinsic normative force through expectations,
  while conventions solve coordination problems without such force.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for distinguishing traditions from norms. The article's
  analysis of norm change and dissolution is particularly relevant: norms can
  unravel when expectations become misaligned or when sanctions cease. If
  traditions have norm-like structure, similar mechanisms may explain tradition-
  breakdown. However, traditions seem to involve additional temporal dimension:
  connection to past, not just present expectations. The article's discussion
  of "bad norms" (persistent despite being harmful) may illuminate why
  traditions persist even when dysfunctional.

  expectation-based approach following Bicchieri.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of philosophical theories of social
  institutions: atomistic (institutions reducible to individual attitudes/
  actions), collective acceptance (Searle, Tuomela), and teleological (Miller).
  Discusses structure (roles, rules), function (collective ends), and
  normative questions (justice, legitimacy). Institutions are distinguished
  from mere conventions and norms by their organizational complexity,
  durability, and role in structuring social life. Key debates: methodological
  individualism versus holism, constitutive rules versus collective ends.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic framework for asking whether traditions are
  social institutions or constitute a distinct category. The article's
  distinction between institutions and conventions is crucial: institutions
  are complex, enduring, organized structures serving collective ends; conventions
  are simpler coordination devices. Traditions seem intermediate: more complex
  than conventions but perhaps less organizationally structured than paradigm
  institutions (governments, corporations). The article's discussion of
  institutional persistence illuminates tradition-maintenance mechanisms.

  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Virtues are dispositions acquired through participation in
  social practices—cooperative activities with goods internal to the practice
  and standards of excellence recognized by practitioners. Practices require
  traditions: narrative continuities connecting past, present, and future,
  transmitting and developing standards of excellence. Traditions provide
  context for rational inquiry: what counts as good reason depends on
  tradition-specific standards. Living traditions involve ongoing argument
  about what the tradition requires—they are "historically extended,
  socially embodied arguments."

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre provides the most influential philosophical account
  of traditions as contexts for practical rationality. His practice-based
  view emphasizes that traditions are not static repositories but dynamic
  arguments. For the project, MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted
  rationality is crucial: if rationality is tradition-dependent, tradition-
  breakdown threatens rational inquiry itself. His concept of "practices"
  with internal goods provides framework for asking when traditions degenerate:
  when connection between practice and internal goods is severed, when
  external goods (power, wealth) corrupt the practice. Essential but requires
  critical engagement.

  doi = {10.1163/18722636-12341287},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre offer fundamentally different
  views of tradition despite all being "traditionalist" thinkers. Arendt sees
  tradition as transmission of foundational political experience (Roman
  authority, Greek philosophy, Hebrew religion) that modernity has broken.
  Oakeshott sees tradition as unreflective practical knowledge embedded in
  customs and practices. MacIntyre sees tradition as rational argument extended
  across generations about how to achieve goods. These views imply different
  accounts of tradition-breakdown: for Arendt, violent rupture; for Oakeshott,
  rationalist interference; for MacIntyre, epistemic crisis within tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis illuminates how "tradition" is contested
  even among philosophers who valorize it. For the project, Alexander's
  distinction matters because different views of what traditions ARE imply
  different theories of how they fail. The article shows that conceptual
  analysis of tradition cannot be neutral—it already involves taking sides
  on substantive questions about rationality, modernity, and political order.
  Important for recognizing that domain 1 (conceptual analysis) cannot be
  fully separated from domain 2 (normative value).

  title = {Shared and Institutional Agency: Toward a Planning Theory of Human Practical Organization},
  year = {2022},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shared agency involves interlocking intentions, mutual
  responsiveness, and commitment to shared activity. Institutional agency
  extends shared agency through role-governed structures: agents occupy roles
  with associated norms, coordinate through role-awareness, and sustain
  institutions through planning-like structures of interconnected policies.
  Bratman's planning theory explains how institutions persist across membership
  changes: the planning structure remains while individual participants change.
  Emphasizes procedural coordination rather than collective ends or collective
  acceptance.

  RELEVANCE: Bratman's planning-theoretic approach may illuminate traditions
  as intergenerational planning structures: earlier generations create policies
  (practices, norms) that later generations inherit and adapt. The emphasis
  on procedural coordination without requiring shared collective ends fits
  traditions where original purposes are lost but practices continue. For
  breakdown: traditions fail when planning structures no longer coordinate
  action across generations, when interlocking intentions dissolve. Bratman
  rarely discusses temporal extension or intergenerational structures explicitly,
  but framework is adaptable.

  doi = {10.1177/1474885118782384},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bourke challenges the standard narrative that traces conservatism to Burke's opposition to the French Revolution, arguing that the idea of a unified conservative tradition is a belated construction rather than a historical reality. Burke was an opposition Whig devoted to reform, not a conservative in the modern sense. The notion of a "conservative philosophy" is fundamentally misconceived.

  RELEVANCE: This revisionist history is crucial for the project because it questions whether there IS a coherent conservative tradition defending tradition. If Bourke is right, conservative defenses of tradition may be more fragmented and context-dependent than typically assumed. This bears directly on understanding how traditions fail: if conservatism itself lacks continuity, it undermines epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom.

  doi = {10.5040/9781350067219},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: H{\"o}rcher provides a systematic contemporary defense of conservative political philosophy centered on three pillars: prudence (practical wisdom in politics), moderation (avoiding extremes), and tradition (as source of wisdom and continuity). He argues that conservatism is not mere resistance to change but a thoughtful approach to maintaining what works while adapting gradually. Tradition provides epistemic advantages through accumulated experience.

  RELEVANCE: This recent systematic treatment connects classical conservative themes (Burke, Oakeshott) to contemporary political philosophy. H{\"o}rcher's emphasis on tradition as epistemically valuable (not just identity-constituting) relates directly to the project's concern with when traditions lose their value. His account of prudence suggests traditions degenerate when prudential judgment is abandoned for ideological certainty.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the 1948 correspondence between Karl Popper and Michael Oakeshott regarding rationalism and tradition. While both criticized utopianism, they differed fundamentally: Popper advocated critical rationalism and piecemeal social engineering, while Oakeshott defended tradition as embodying practical knowledge resistant to rationalist reform. The exchange reveals deep tensions between liberal rationalism and conservative traditionalism.

  RELEVANCE: This exchange illuminates the core epistemic dispute about tradition. Popper's position that tradition must justify itself through critical scrutiny contrasts with Oakeshott's view that traditions embody tacit knowledge beyond explicit justification. This bears on tradition breakdown: Oakeshott would see degeneration as loss of tacit knowledge, Popper as failure to adapt through criticism.

  doi = {10.1007/s11158-005-0558-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes MacIntyre's response to the charge that tradition-based rationality leads to relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions can be rationally compared when one tradition encounters an epistemological crisis it cannot resolve using its own resources, while a rival tradition can explain and resolve that crisis. Rationality is tradition-constituted but not relativistic because traditions can be shown superior through their capacity to overcome intellectual crises.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's account of epistemological crisis within traditions is directly relevant to understanding tradition breakdown. Traditions degenerate when they lose the capacity for self-correction and encounter crises they cannot resolve. This provides a non-relativist framework for judging tradition failure that conservatives could accept.

  POSITION: MacIntyrean neo-Aristotelian defense of tradition-constituted rationality against relativism, emphasizing traditions' capacity for self-critique and development.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jones traces how Edmund Burke was retrospectively constructed as the "father of conservatism" in the nineteenth century. Burke's thought was selectively appropriated and transformed by later thinkers to create a conservative intellectual tradition. This invention process reveals that conservatism is less a stable philosophy than a politically useful narrative about continuity with the past.

  RELEVANCE: Like Bourke's work, this challenges the idea of a coherent conservative tradition defending tradition. If conservatism itself is an invented tradition, this undermines epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom and raises questions about conservative authority to pronounce on tradition's value. The "invention" of conservatism may itself exemplify tradition degeneration through distortion.

The book addresses challenges that MacIntyre's position faces incoherence or slides into relativism.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's framework is one of the most sophisticated contemporary defenses of tradition in philosophy. His account of how traditions develop through encountering and resolving epistemological crises provides resources for understanding both tradition vitality and degeneration. The book's analysis of MacIntyre's Thomism shows how he thinks traditions can be ranked, relevant to normative assessments of tradition value.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the relationship between linguistic competence and MacIntyre's notion of tradition-constituted rationality. Argues that MacIntyre's account of tradition is grounded in Wittgensteinian insights about language as social practice. Just as linguistic meaning requires participation in language games embedded in forms of life, rationality requires participation in tradition-constituted practices. Competence in both cases is acquired through training and socialization, not derivable from explicit rules.

  RELEVANCE: This linguistic analysis illuminates how traditions function and what their breakdown might involve. If rationality is like linguistic competence—requiring immersion in practices—then tradition degeneration might be like language death: loss of fluent practitioners who can navigate the tradition skillfully. This provides an account of what's lost when traditions fail.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares three major twentieth-century philosophical accounts of tradition: Hannah Arendt (tradition as broken), Michael Oakeshott (tradition as continuously operative), and Alasdair MacIntyre (tradition as something that should condition action). Each differs in their assessment of modernity's relationship to tradition. Arendt sees tradition as severed and irretrievable, Oakeshott sees it as inevitably present in all human activity, MacIntyre sees it as endangered but recoverable through conscious adherence.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis reveals fundamentally different diagnoses of tradition's status in modernity. The contrast between Oakeshott (tradition always operates) and Arendt (tradition is broken) bears directly on whether tradition degeneration is possible or what form it takes. MacIntyre's intermediate position suggests traditions can fail but be revived through deliberate cultivation.

Discusses tensions between traditional authority and critical rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the epistemic argument for tradition directly, examining whether traditions provide genuine knowledge or merely inherited prejudice. The answer bears on what's lost when traditions degenerate: if traditions embody accumulated wisdom, their loss represents genuine epistemic damage.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Roger Scruton's political philosophy as drawing on classical sources, particularly Plato and Aristotle, while avoiding rigid adherence to either. Scruton synthesizes Platonic emphasis on transcendent values and beauty with Aristotelian emphasis on practices, virtues, and human flourishing. His conservatism sees politics as essential to human life (thick conception) rather than merely instrumental, and emphasizes civic participation as part of flourishing.

  RELEVANCE: Scruton represents contemporary conservative philosophy that grounds tradition in classical philosophical arguments about human nature and the good life. His synthesis of Platonic and Aristotelian themes shows how conservative traditionalism connects to virtue ethics and perfectionism. This bears on tradition value: if traditions embody goods essential to flourishing, their breakdown damages human well-being directly.

While Habermas seeks universal rational foundations for morality through ideal discourse, Oakeshott insists moral and political knowledge is embedded in inherited practices and traditions that cannot be reduced to explicit principles. The paper explores implications of this disagreement for democratic theory.

  RELEVANCE: This debate between Habermasian rationalism and Oakeshottian traditionalism is central to understanding arguments about tradition's value. It reveals a fundamental divide: whether moral knowledge requires explicit rational justification (Habermas) or is carried in practices resistant to full articulation (Oakeshott).

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Creates dialogue between John Rawls and Michael Oakeshott on rationalism, tradition, and relativism. Argues that while Rawls appears to offer rationalist foundations for justice, his method of reflective equilibrium and appeal to ideas "implicit in public culture" actually makes him closer to Oakeshott's traditionalism than commonly recognized. Both root political principles in existing traditions and practices rather than pure reason, though they differ on which tradition and how explicitly.

  RELEVANCE: This convergence thesis suggests that even liberal political philosophy may require appeal to tradition, undermining sharp dichotomies between rationalism and traditionalism. It complicates the project's framework: if liberals like Rawls also rely on tradition (American constitutional tradition), then tradition breakdown affects liberal and conservative projects alike. The question becomes which traditions and how they're invoked.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Sandel challenges Rawlsian liberalism's conception of the self as prior to and independent of its ends. He argues that individuals are constituted by communal attachments and traditions that shape their identity, not merely bearers of rights choosing among life plans. Justice requires recognizing how community and tradition constitute the self, not just distributing goods fairly among atomistic individuals. This communitarian critique emphasizes tradition's identity-constituting role.

  RELEVANCE: Sandel's communitarianism provides the identity-based argument for tradition's value, complementing epistemic arguments. If traditions constitute our identities, their breakdown represents loss of self-understanding and coherent identity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares MacIntyre's philosophical account of tradition with theologian George Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic approach to religious traditions. Both emphasize how traditions function as interpretive frameworks that shape practitioners' experience and reasoning. Lindbeck's focus on tradition as communal language game complements MacIntyre's emphasis on practices and narrative. Together they show traditions as comprehensive frameworks, not mere collections of beliefs.

  RELEVANCE: This comparison illuminates tradition's comprehensive nature: not just discrete beliefs or practices but whole frameworks for interpreting experience. This bears on tradition breakdown: degeneration involves loss of the interpretive framework itself, not just specific elements. When traditions fail, practitioners lose the conceptual resources to make sense of their experience within that tradition.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Hannah Arendt's analysis of tradition's collapse to critique contemporary radical conservatism. Arendt argued that genuine tradition was broken by modernity's revolutions, and attempts to restore it artificially result in pseudo-tradition serving nihilistic ends. Contemporary radical conservatism often legitimizes itself through appeals to crisis of tradition while actually embodying anti-traditional attitudes. Distinguishes genuine conservatism (preserving living tradition) from pseudo-conservatism (instrumentalizing tradition for power).

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of pseudo-tradition is crucial for understanding tradition degeneration. Traditions can fail not only by dying out but by being corrupted into simulacra serving ideological purposes. The distinction between genuine and pseudo-conservatism suggests criteria for judging tradition authenticity: does it preserve living practices or merely invoke "tradition" rhetorically?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between tradition and conservatism through their stances on continuity, change, and freedom. Distinguishes Anglo-American conservatism (emphasizing individual liberty and limited government) from European conservatism (emphasizing social hierarchy and organic community).

Traditionalism (rigid adherence) differs from conservatism (thoughtful preservation).

  RELEVANCE: This distinction between tradition, traditionalism, and different conservative schools clarifies debates about tradition's value.

  doi = {10.1177/0953946820984077},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes MacIntyre's late concept of "sociological self-knowledge" from Ethics in the Conflicts of Modernity (2016). MacIntyre argues that moral traditions must develop understanding of the social structures in which they operate, not just abstract moral principles. This requires critical realist sociology to grasp how institutions shape moral possibilities. Christian ethics needs both tradition-based virtues and sociological understanding of contemporary institutions to address practical moral questions.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's emphasis on sociological self-knowledge for tradition vitality is directly relevant to understanding tradition breakdown. Traditions may degenerate when they lose capacity to understand their social context and how institutions enable or obstruct their practices. This suggests tradition failure involves not just internal corruption but inability to navigate changing social structures intelligently.

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  year = {1996},
  doi = {10.1515/9781400864447},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beiser argues that early English Enlightenment thinkers
  developed a systematic defense of reason's authority against traditional
  religious and political authorities, establishing rationality as the
  supreme arbiter of truth and legitimacy. This involved not merely
  criticizing tradition but constructing positive arguments for reason's
  sovereignty over inherited belief.

  RELEVANCE: This work establishes the foundational Enlightenment
  epistemological critique of tradition as heteronomous authority. It
  provides historical grounding for understanding how the tradition-reason
  opposition became central to modern philosophy, directly informing the
  project's investigation of when traditions are deemed to have failed or
  degenerated by Enlightenment standards.

  POSITION: Represents the classical Enlightenment position that rational
  critique should supersede traditional authority in determining truth and
  political legitimacy.

  doi = {10.1515/9780804788090},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Horkheimer and Adorno argue that Enlightenment reason, in
  its quest to dominate nature and liberate humanity from myth and
  tradition, paradoxically generates new forms of domination and
  reification. Instrumental rationality—reason reduced to mere calculation—
  becomes a totalizing force that perpetuates the very barbarism the
  Enlightenment sought to overcome.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational critical theory text complicates simple
  Enlightenment critiques of tradition by revealing how rational critique
  itself can become oppressive. It is essential for understanding how
  traditions might degenerate not through irrationality but through the
  rationalization process itself, and for analyzing the dialectical
  relationship between tradition, reason, and domination.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Folkers examines Foucault's genealogy of critique from
  ancient parrhesia (truth-telling) through Enlightenment to neoliberal
  critique of the state. Foucault develops an affirmative genealogy showing
  critique not as mere negation but as a complex practice involving truth,
  power, and ethical self-formation. Critical practice questions the power
  effects of rationality itself.

  RELEVANCE: This paper illuminates how Foucault's approach to critique
  differs from both traditional Enlightenment reason and Frankfurt School
  dialectics. It provides tools for analyzing how traditions can be
  critically engaged without assuming a standpoint of pure reason external
  to power relations, crucial for understanding tradition breakdown as
  involving power-knowledge configurations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Cooke argues that Habermas's discourse theory attempts to
  reconcile private autonomy (individual freedom from interference) and
  public autonomy (democratic self-legislation) through the co-originality
  thesis, but fails due to an inadequate account of private autonomy. She
  proposes a dialogical conception of autonomy as ethically
  self-determining agency that would better support Habermas's reconciliation
  project.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses the central tension between individual
  autonomy and collective tradition/law that runs through liberal and
  critical theory. Habermas's attempt to show these as mutually constitutive
  rather than opposed is crucial for understanding how traditions might be
  both constraining and enabling, and how their breakdown might involve
  failures of this dialectical relationship.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Deveaux examines the arranged marriage debate to explore
  tensions between liberal commitments to personal autonomy and respect for
  cultural traditions. She argues that liberal critiques often oversimplify
  traditional practices by ignoring women's agency within cultural contexts

  approach recognizes how autonomy can be exercised within traditional

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the autonomy-tradition tension
  central to the project, showing how this plays out in concrete cases. It
  demonstrates how liberal critiques can misidentify tradition breakdown

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lee provides a comprehensive overview of relational

  autonomy conceptions. Relational accounts capture how social contexts
  constitute agency while distinguishing between social phenomena that
  enhance versus hinder autonomy. These approaches recognize persons as
  socially embedded while maintaining critical standards for evaluating
  social conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Relational autonomy is crucial for moving beyond the stark
  tradition-versus-autonomy dichotomy. It provides conceptual resources for
  understanding how traditions can constitute the conditions for autonomy
  while also potentially undermining it, essential for analyzing tradition
  breakdown as involving degradation of autonomy-supporting social relations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ikuta argues that Mill conceived conformity to custom as a
  form of social tyranny with both external (social coercion) and internal
  (self-tyranny through undermined autonomy) dimensions. Individuality is
  Mill's solution requiring both that conformists cease tyrannizing others
  through social penalties and that they cultivate their own capacity for
  autonomous judgment against mere custom.

  RELEVANCE: Mill's account of custom as social tyranny provides a paradigm
  liberal critique of tradition as constraining individual development. This
  is foundational for understanding liberal standards by which traditions
  are judged to have failed or become oppressive, and for analyzing how
  tradition breakdown might involve loss of individuality versus conformism.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zion-Waldoks analyzes Israeli Modern-Orthodox women
  activists who engage in feminist resistance as religious actors working

  resistance"—critique within relationship to tradition, enabled by cultural
  schema and comprising both interpretive skills and relational-autonomy
  capacities. This challenges dichotomies like feminism/religion and
  resistance/submission.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical case demonstrates how agency and critique can
  operate within rather than against traditional frameworks. It challenges
  assumptions that tradition critique requires external standpoints and

  CORE ARGUMENT: Gutmann sketches the anti-paternalist liberal tradition
  from Kant to Dworkin centered on normative individualism and protecting
  conditions of autonomy as individual rights. He distinguishes "personal
  autonomy" (perfectionist ideals of autonomous persons) from "autonomy as
  a right" (Feinberg), showing the liberal tradition focuses on rights
  rather than perfectionist ideals, though both involve protecting agency.

  RELEVANCE: This clarifies the conceptual foundations of liberal autonomy
  and its opposition to paternalistic authority, including traditional
  authority. The distinction between autonomy as ideal versus autonomy as
  right is important for understanding different ways traditions might
  conflict with or support autonomy, and different standards for judging
  tradition breakdown.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schiemann argues that rational choice theory and

  depends on irreducibly intersubjective "lifeworld" categories that cannot
  be reduced to instrumental rationality. Together, these traditions provide
  better understanding than either alone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates how traditions (as lifeworld
  background) enable rather than merely constrain rational action. It

  CORE ARGUMENT: Heller argues that Hegel's concept of utility in the
  Phenomenology cannot be reduced to instrumentalization as Adorno and
  Horkheimer suggest. For Hegel, utility describes mutual support in a
  collective that respects heterogeneity. A post-Hegelian utility concept
  establishes constitutive relations between self-care and usefulness to
  others, contributing to affirmative Enlightenment rather than domination.

  RELEVANCE: This reconceptualization of Enlightenment utility challenges
  the Frankfurt School's pessimistic reading and suggests how Enlightenment
  critique of tradition need not culminate in pure instrumentalization. It
  provides resources for understanding non-dominating relationships between
  reason and social practice relevant to tradition analysis.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kent argues against pessimistic readings of Dialectic of

  mediation offers potential for enlightenment. Myth can illuminate
  contingent historical factors that led to domination while reflecting
  alternative human possibilities, presenting renewed chances for liberation
  through critical engagement with tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This reading suggests tradition (as myth) is not merely
  heteronomous domination but contains fragmentary resources for critique
  and alternative possibilities. It challenges stark tradition-versus-reason
  dichotomies and suggests tradition breakdown might involve loss of access

  CORE ARGUMENT: Schoolman argues that Dialectic of Enlightenment deploys
  aesthetic reason as a form of aporetic critique that avoids the
  "embarrassment" of claiming a privileged rational standpoint while

  non-dominating forms of rationality and preserves critical capacity
  without transcendental foundations.

  RELEVANCE: This interpretation illuminates how critical theory can critique
  tradition and instrumental reason without assuming an external rational
  standpoint. It suggests aesthetic dimensions of tradition might resist
  reduction to instrumental utility, relevant to understanding multi-

  CORE ARGUMENT: Smirnov traces two traditions of freedom—negative freedom

  interference possibilities and internalized oppression. However, autonomy
  conceptions also have limitations regarding externally imposed values and
  their internalization.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of competing freedom conceptions illuminates
  different ways traditions might constrain freedom—through direct
  interference (liberal concern) or through internalization of oppressive

  intuitions.

  RELEVANCE: This reveals internal tensions in liberal theory's autonomy
  commitments and neutrality principles that inform liberal critiques of

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that democratic discourse can be reconciled with

  Stout defends democracy as a tradition of its own—one that absorbs and

  democratic deliberation is enriched by diverse traditional sources while
  remaining committed to democratic accountability.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how democracy itself can be
  understood as a tradition rather than merely a procedural framework. Stout's
  work addresses directly how inherited traditions can ground political
  legitimacy without undermining democratic self-governance. His pragmatist

  and sustain valuable practices).

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's focus on tradition's normative
  value and the conditions under which traditions succeed or fail. Wall
  provides a framework for analyzing when deference to tradition is justified

  CORE ARGUMENT: Interrogates how appeals to a realist "tradition" function in

  from Thucydides through Machiavelli to Weber, but this invocation is
  problematic given realism's contextualist commitments. The realist tradition
  is less a coherent inheritance than a constructed narrative serving present

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes how constitutional identity is constructed through
  the interplay of self, citizenship, and tradition. Rosenfeld argues that
  constitutional subjects must navigate tensions between inherited traditions

  identity requires both continuity with tradition and critical distance from
  it. Founding myths and civic traditions play essential but problematic roles
  in constituting political identity.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how constitutional traditions shape
  political identity and legitimacy. Rosenfeld's analysis of founding myths
  and civic traditions addresses how traditions ground political authority
  while remaining open to critique and reconstruction. His account of

  doi = {10.1017/9781139236249},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how Dicey articulated a distinctively common law
  approach to constitutionalism grounded in legal tradition rather than written
  documents. Walters argues that common law constitutionalism represents a
  tradition-based alternative to rationalist constitutional design, where
  constitutional norms emerge from judicial practice and precedent over time.
  This common law constitutional tradition embodies collective wisdom but
  remains responsive to changing circumstances through incremental adaptation.

  RELEVANCE: Illuminates how constitutional traditions function differently from
  formal constitutional texts. Walters' account of common law constitutional
  tradition provides a model of tradition that evolves gradually while
  maintaining continuity. This is relevant to understanding both how traditions
  sustain political orders and how they can adapt without breaking down.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops an account of political legitimacy that distinguishes
  between traditional grounds of legitimacy (consent, tradition, democratic

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the relationship between power and legitimacy,
  arguing that all power requires legitimation but traditional sources of
  legitimacy are insufficient on their own. Beetham distinguishes between
  legal validity, justifiability in terms of shared beliefs, and evidence of
  consent. Traditional authority represents one mode of legitimation that works
  when shared beliefs support inherited power structures, but tradition alone
  cannot ground legitimacy without also meeting legal and consent-based
  criteria.

  doi = {10.5840/MONIST197760427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre argues that epistemological crises occur when an agent's or
  tradition's existing conceptual schemes prove inadequate to make sense of new experiences
  or problems, requiring narrative reconstruction to restore intelligibility. He distinguishes
  three stages: initial coherence, breakdown when anomalies accumulate, and resolution through
  a new narrative that explains both prior successes and the crisis itself. The article
  applies this framework to both individual agents and traditions of inquiry (including
  scientific paradigms), arguing that successful crisis resolution requires constructing a
  narrative that makes the previous tradition and its failure intelligible from a new standpoint.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for understanding MacIntyre's account of tradition
  breakdown. It provides the core theoretical framework for analyzing how traditions fail when
  they encounter problems their conceptual resources cannot solve. The epistemological crisis
  concept is essential for distinguishing living traditions (which can undergo creative
  transformation) from dead ones (which cannot adapt). This article directly addresses the
  research question on theories of tradition degeneration by offering a systematic philosophical
  account of the mechanism of breakdown.

  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre develops his theory of tradition-constituted rationality, arguing
  that all reasoning takes place within particular traditions of inquiry. He traces the
  development and internal crises of four major traditions (Homeric, Aristotelian, Augustinian,
  Scottish Enlightenment) to show how each faced problems that required fundamental conceptual
  revision. The book systematically explores how traditions develop, encounter crises, and
  either successfully transform or fail. MacIntyre argues that tradition failure occurs when
  adherents can no longer defend their core commitments against both internal incoherence and
  external challenges, leading to "sterile relativism" or abandonment.

  RELEVANCE: This book elaborates MacIntyre's mature theory of tradition breakdown through
  extended historical case studies. It shows how the epistemological crisis framework applies
  to major philosophical and cultural traditions, demonstrating the patterns of degeneration
  and transformation. The work is crucial for understanding how living traditions differ from
  dead ones: living traditions sustain internal debate and can undergo rational transformation,
  while dead traditions ossify into dogmatism or dissolve into incoherence. Essential for the
  research question on tradition degeneration mechanisms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Angier provides a systematic analysis of MacIntyre's concept of tradition,
  examining how traditions are constituted, how they develop, and crucially, how they fail.
  He clarifies the distinction between living traditions (characterized by ongoing argument
  about their goods and purposes) and dead or degenerate traditions (which cease internal
  debate and become either rigid or incoherent). The article examines MacIntyre's criteria
  for tradition health: the capacity for self-criticism, engagement with rival traditions,
  and ability to identify and resolve internal contradictions.

  RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis helps clarify MacIntyre's often complex account of
  tradition breakdown. Angier's systematic treatment makes explicit the criteria distinguishing
  living from dead traditions, which is central to the research question. The article is
  particularly valuable for understanding how MacIntyre's framework can be applied to assess

  doi = {10.1177/0048393107299685},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs analyzes Edward Shils's multifaceted theory of tradition as developed
  in his 1981 book "Tradition." Shils conceived tradition not as static inheritance but as
  active transmission requiring institutional bearers and cultural reproduction. Jacobs
  identifies four perspectives in Shils's work: pragmatic (traditions as useful social
  coordination), Burkean (traditions as embodied wisdom), veridical (traditions as truth-bearing),
  and evolutionist (traditions as adapted practices). The article examines Shils's typology of
  traditions and his account of how traditions weaken through institutional failure, loss of
  bearers, or disconnection from practice.

  RELEVANCE: Shils provides the most comprehensive sociological theory of tradition to
  complement MacIntyre's philosophical approach. His work on institutional bearers and
  transmission mechanisms helps explain the sociological dimensions of tradition breakdown
  that MacIntyre's epistemological focus sometimes neglects. Understanding how traditions
  depend on institutions and cultural reproduction is essential for analyzing their
  degeneration. This article makes Shils's complex theory accessible and shows its relevance
  for understanding tradition failure.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Herman traces the intellectual history of "declinism" from ancient times to
  the present, examining how major thinkers have theorized cultural and civilizational
  degeneration. He analyzes two main traditions: pessimistic declinism (exemplified by
  Spengler) which sees decline as inevitable cyclical process, and optimistic responses
  which seek renewal through return to foundations or progressive transformation. Herman
  shows how theories of cultural decline have shaped political movements and identifies
  common patterns in declinist narratives: loss of vitality, corruption of values,
  disconnection from authentic sources, and replacement of living culture with dead forms.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on cultural rather than tradition-specific decline, Herman's
  intellectual history illuminates broader patterns in theories of degeneration that apply
  to traditions. His analysis of Spengler and other decline theorists shows how they
  understood cultural ossification and loss of vitality - concepts directly relevant to
  tradition breakdown. The book provides historical context for understanding contemporary
  theories of tradition degeneration and identifies recurring themes in accounts of how
  cultures and traditions lose their animating spirit.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Church applies MacIntyre's theory of tradition breakdown to the American
  constitutional tradition, arguing it has entered epistemological crisis. He contends the
  tradition's core commitments (individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty)
  have become incoherent when applied to contemporary problems, producing endless controversy
  without resolution. Church examines both MacIntyrean and theological resources for
  addressing this crisis, arguing that successful resolution requires narrative reconstruction
  that makes previous constitutional understandings and their failure intelligible from a

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how MacIntyre's framework applies to concrete political
  traditions, showing what tradition breakdown looks like in practice. It illustrates the
  epistemological crisis concept through detailed analysis of American constitutionalism,
  making abstract theory concrete. The article is particularly valuable for showing how

  CORE ARGUMENT: Szabados examines how Wittgenstein and Mahler responded philosophically
  and artistically to the breakdown of their respective traditions. He argues both faced
  crises where inherited forms and methods no longer sufficed, requiring creative
  transformation while maintaining connection to tradition. Szabados shows how tradition
  breakdown manifests in inability to work creatively within inherited forms, forcing either
  abandonment or radical reconception. The article explores what it means to continue a
  tradition when its fundamental assumptions have collapsed.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on philosophy and music, this article illuminates the phenomenology
  of working within breaking-down traditions - the lived experience of tradition crisis. It
  shows how tradition breakdown manifests not just conceptually but in practical inability to
  employ inherited methods productively. The analysis helps understand the difference between
  creative development within living tradition versus the sterility of working in dead forms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Petersen applies MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to Marxian
  economic theory, arguing it has been "defeated by its opponents" as a tradition of inquiry.
  He contends that Marxian economics failed to resolve internal theoretical problems and
  withstand external criticism, entering terminal crisis. The article analyzes whether a
  synthesis between Aristotelian philosophy and Marxian economics (as MacIntyre suggests)
  can revive the tradition, concluding such synthesis faces insurmountable obstacles. Petersen
  examines the criteria for determining when a tradition has truly failed versus merely facing
  temporary difficulties.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates MacIntyre's framework applied to a specific intellectual
  tradition, showing what it means for a tradition to be "defeated" rather than merely
  challenged. It helps clarify the difference between normal difficulties (which living
  traditions overcome) and terminal crisis (which marks tradition failure). The analysis of
  whether Marxian economics has failed or can be reconstructed illuminates criteria for
  assessing tradition viability. Useful for understanding when traditions cross from crisis
  to collapse.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Luki{\'c} applies MacIntyre's concept of intelligibility crisis to the
  breakdown of Yugoslav political narrative across three periods: pre-Yugoslav, Yugoslav,

  narrative coherence, and how their breakdown produces disorientation and conflict. Luki{\'c}
  demonstrates that tradition failure involves loss of narrative coherence that made actions
  and identities intelligible.

  tradition demonstrates the ongoing relevance of epistemological crisis theory. It shows
  how political tradition breakdown manifests as loss of narrative intelligibility, making
  the concept concrete through historical example. The article illustrates what happens when
  political narratives fail: people lose capacity to make sense of their situation and

  CORE ARGUMENT: Kinghorn applies MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to psychiatric

  in the 1970s. He contends that while DSM achieved political success, it faces ongoing
  scientific and philosophical critique that may precipitate future crisis. Kinghorn argues
  for "epistemological humility" - recognition that psychiatric traditions have inherent
  limitations requiring honest reckoning. The article shows how traditions can achieve
  institutional dominance while remaining epistemologically fragile.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on psychiatry, this article illustrates key aspects of
  epistemological crisis theory: how traditions respond to foundational challenges, achieve
  temporary stability through institutional power rather than intellectual resolution, and
  remain vulnerable to future crisis. It demonstrates the difference between politically
  successful and epistemologically sound crisis resolution. The concept of "epistemological
  humility" adds useful nuance to understanding how traditions should acknowledge their
  limitations to avoid pathological rigidity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz examines the central role of narrative in MacIntyre's account of
  tradition-constituted rationality, arguing that traditions are fundamentally narrative
  structures. He shows how traditions maintain rational coherence through narratives that

  collapse or incoherence. Lutz clarifies how MacIntyre's narrative epistemology differs from
  both foundationalist and coherentist alternatives, emphasizing temporal structure and
  teleological orientation. The article explains why narrative failure produces epistemological
  crisis.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the epistemological foundations of MacIntyre's tradition
  theory, showing why narrative coherence is essential for tradition rationality. Understanding
  the narrative dimension helps explain how traditions fail: they lose narrative coherence,
  cannot construct meaningful accounts of their development, or cannot project credible futures.
  The analysis deepens understanding of why epistemological crises require narrative
  reconstruction rather than just conceptual revision. Essential for grasping the connection

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Spengler presents a cyclical theory of civilizational rise and decline,
  arguing that cultures pass through organic life stages from birth through maturity to
  inevitable death. He contends that Western civilization has entered its "winter" phase
  of decline, characterized by rationalization, mechanization, loss of spiritual vitality,
  and replacement of organic culture with dead "civilization." Spengler sees decline as
  inevitable transformation from creative cultural phase to ossified civilizational phase.
  His morphological approach treats cultures as organisms with natural life cycles.

  RELEVANCE: Though philosophically controversial, Spengler's work provides influential
  framework for understanding cultural decline and ossification that has shaped subsequent
  tradition theory. His distinction between living "culture" (creative, organic) and dead
  "civilization" (mechanical, ossified) parallels the living/dead tradition distinction.
  While his biological determinism is problematic, his phenomenology of cultural vitality
  loss remains influential. Important for historical context of tradition breakdown theories

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bennett analyzes contemporary narratives of cultural decline and pessimism

  whether such pessimism is justified or itself a cultural pathology, exploring the paradox
  that cultural decline narratives may themselves contribute to cultural breakdown by
  undermining confidence in cultural transmission.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of contemporary cultural pessimism provides context for
  understanding modern forms of tradition breakdown anxiety. Bennett's examination of how
  decline narratives function in postmodern context illuminates contemporary theories of
  tradition degeneration. His discussion of whether cultural pessimism is warranted or
  pathological relates to questions about when tradition-critical consciousness becomes

  CORE ARGUMENT: Hollenbach distinguishes "living tradition" from "traditionalism" (the
  "dead faith of the living") in context of Catholic human rights teaching. He argues living
  traditions involve ongoing development and creative engagement with new challenges, while
  traditionalism involves rigid adherence to past formulas. Hollenbach shows how Catholic
  tradition on human rights has developed substantially, demonstrating characteristics of
  living tradition: ability to learn, adapt, and address new problems while maintaining
  continuity with core commitments.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides concrete example of living versus dead tradition
  distinction in action. Hollenbach's analysis shows what tradition vitality looks like
  practically: capacity for development, engagement with contemporary challenges, and creative

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Swer defends Spengler's thesis about the decline of Western science against
  Haack's criticisms, arguing that science faces diminishing returns and exhaustion of its
  creative phase. He distinguishes Spengler's "annihilationist" view (science will cease)
  from completion/culmination views, examining both externalist (cultural) and internalist
  (scientific) arguments for decline. Swer argues that even if Spengler's biological determinism
  fails, his phenomenology of scientific vitality loss and ossification deserves serious
  consideration as describing real patterns in scientific development.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on science, this article illustrates key concepts in tradition
  breakdown theory: the difference between creative vitality and mechanical continuation,
  the possibility of exhaustion without formal ending, and the distinction between living
  practice and ossified form. Swer's defense of Spenglerian decline patterns (while rejecting
  determinism) shows how theories of tradition degeneration can capture real phenomena despite
  flawed metaphysical foundations. Useful for understanding decline and ossification concepts.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kurilovich examines how Koj{\`e}ve distinguished between living and dead
  dogma in Christian theology, using this distinction to selectively engage with Christianity's
  intellectual heritage. The article shows how Koj{\`e}ve's approach involves "demythologizing"
  tradition - extracting productive insights while abandoning what he sees as dead metaphysical
  commitments. Kurilovich analyzes the criteria Koj{\`e}ve uses to distinguish intellectually
  living from dead elements of tradition, and the philosophical assumptions underlying these
  judgments.

  RELEVANCE: This article illuminates the concept of "dead" versus "living" elements within
  traditions through Koj{\`e}ve's selective appropriation of Christianity. It raises important
  questions about whether traditions can be partially living and partially dead, and about
  the criteria for making such distinctions. Koj{\`e}ve's approach exemplifies one response
  to tradition crisis: selective preservation of "living" elements. The analysis helps clarify
  what makes tradition elements "dead" (metaphysically untenable, historically superseded)
  versus "living" (philosophically productive, culturally vital).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vasiljevi{\'c} analyzes Zizioulas's hermeneutical principles distinguishing
  "living tradition" from "dead tradition." Zizioulas argues that tradition becomes dead when
  reduced to historical artifact or object of curiosity rather than lived encounter. Living
  tradition requires active interpretative engagement, liturgical participation, and
  eschatological orientation. The article examines how Zizioulas sees tradition pathology
  arising from static readings that treat tradition as fixed past rather than dynamic
  transmission requiring contemporary engagement and interpretation.

  RELEVANCE: This theological analysis provides additional perspective on living/dead tradition
  distinction, emphasizing the importance of active engagement versus passive reception.
  Zizioulas's framework complements MacIntyre's by highlighting the liturgical and participatory
  dimensions of tradition vitality that purely epistemological approaches may miss. His
  emphasis on tradition requiring interpretative engagement to remain living illuminates the
  role of hermeneutical practice in tradition health. Useful for understanding experiential
  and participatory dimensions of tradition breakdown.

  doi = {10.1177/0263276406063230},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer reflects retrospectively on the development and
  reception of his hermeneutic philosophy, particularly the concept of
  effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte) and its impact on understanding how
  interpretation is always shaped by the historical effects of what we
  interpret. He explains how his work sought to reveal the inescapability of
  historical consciousness and the productive role of prejudice in
  understanding, countering Enlightenment notions that prejudices only
  obstruct truth.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides Gadamer's own retrospective account of his
  central concepts, making it essential for understanding effective history
  as the mechanism by which tradition shapes understanding. It directly
  addresses how tradition functions as an ongoing dialogue between past and
  present, which is crucial for explaining both tradition's value and how it
  can evolve or become distorted. The concept of effective history is key to
  understanding how traditions transmit meaning while remaining open to
  reinterpretation.

  doi = {10.1163/1569164042404626},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gander analyzes Gadamer's concept of effective history by
  showing how it mediates between the strangeness of historical distance and
  the familiarity of our own historicity. Understanding requires recognizing
  both the otherness of tradition and our participation in it. The tension
  between distance and belonging is productive rather than a barrier,
  enabling the fusion of horizons that characterizes genuine understanding.

  RELEVANCE: This explication of effective history's dual structure
  (strangeness and familiarity) illuminates how tradition functions
  epistemically—it provides the background understanding that makes
  interpretation possible while also presenting something foreign that
  challenges our assumptions. This tension is crucial for understanding how
  traditions can transmit knowledge while also evolving, and how they might
  break down when either pole (familiarity or strangeness) dominates
  pathologically.

  pages = {581--600},
  doi = {10.1111/EDTH.12135},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Leiviskä argues that Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition
  offers a philosophically rich account of educational transmission that
  avoids both uncritical acceptance and complete rejection of inherited
  knowledge. Education involves initiation into traditions that provide the
  conceptual resources for understanding, while simultaneously cultivating
  the critical capacity to question and revise those traditions. The
  hermeneutic circle is central: students must provisionally accept
  tradition to gain the understanding needed to critically evaluate it.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges Gadamerian hermeneutics and the practical
  question of how traditions are transmitted across generations through
  education. It shows how tradition functions as both authoritative (enabling
  understanding) and open to critique, addressing the project's concern with
  both the value of traditions and how they can change or become defective.
  The educational context makes explicit the intergenerational transmission
  mechanisms that underlie all tradition.

  doi = {10.5840/forphil200914220},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Atkinson defends Gadamer against critics like Warnke and
  Caputo who argue his hermeneutics is inherently conservative because it
  emphasizes tradition's authority. She argues that Gadamer's concept of
  tradition is dialogical and critical: tradition provides the
  pre-understanding necessary for critique, but understanding requires
  actively questioning and testing prejudices through encounter with texts
  and interlocutors. Tradition is a living conversation, not static dogma.

  RELEVANCE: This debate about conservatism directly addresses whether
  Gadamer's account can explain tradition breakdown and defect. If tradition
  merely preserves without critique, it cannot account for needed change or
  evolution. Atkinson's defense shows how the hermeneutic framework includes
  resources for critical engagement with tradition, making it relevant to
  understanding both tradition's value and its potential pathologies when
  dialogue closes down.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke provides a comprehensive reconstruction of Gadamer's
  hermeneutic philosophy, examining how his concepts of tradition, prejudice,
  effective history, and the hermeneutic circle constitute a distinctive
  account of rationality. She critically explores tensions in Gadamer's
  thought, particularly whether his emphasis on tradition's authority leaves
  sufficient room for critical distance and rational revision of inherited
  beliefs. Tradition is both the condition of understanding and potentially
  constraining.

  RELEVANCE: As a major systematic treatment of Gadamer's philosophy, this
  book provides essential background for understanding hermeneutic approaches
  to tradition. Warnke's critical analysis of tensions in Gadamer's account
  is particularly relevant to the project's concern with tradition breakdown—
  she explores how tradition can be both enabling and limiting, and when its
  authority becomes problematic. Her discussion of reason and tradition
  connects hermeneutics to broader epistemological questions.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Odenstedt examines Gadamer's concept of tradition
  specifically in relation to art history, showing how modernity represents a
  qualitative shift in tradition's functioning. Where pre-modern traditions
  operated through relatively stable transmission, modern fragmentation and
  self-consciousness about tradition alter the hermeneutic situation. The
  "decline of tradition" doesn't mean tradition disappears but that its mode
  of operation becomes problematic, requiring more explicit reflection and
  reconstruction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses tradition breakdown and
  degeneration—the project's core concern with how traditions "go wrong."
  Odenstedt's analysis of modernity's impact on tradition provides historical
  and conceptual resources for understanding tradition defect as a structural
  phenomenon rather than mere contingent failure. The shift from organic to
  self-conscious tradition transmission illuminates different vulnerabilities.

  doi = {10.1017/9781108560818},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Greco develops a social epistemology of knowledge
  transmission distinct from knowledge generation, arguing that transmission
  depends on interpersonal trust and cooperative social structures rather
  than individual evidence-gathering. Drawing on virtue epistemology and
  action theory, he models transmission as a form of shared agency (like
  giving a gift or passing a ball) requiring both giver and receiver to play
  their epistemic roles properly. Social context determines whether
  transmission succeeds or fails.

  RELEVANCE: Greco's framework provides social-epistemological tools for
  understanding tradition as a form of knowledge transmission across
  generations. His emphasis on trust, cooperation, and social structures
  helps explain both how traditions successfully transmit knowledge and how
  they can break down when trust erodes or cooperation fails. The distinction
  between transmission and generation is crucial for understanding tradition's
  unique epistemic role and vulnerabilities.

  volume = {200},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-022-03876-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMyler argues that cultural knowledge transmission extends
  beyond paradigmatic testimony to include non-testimonial forms of cultural
  learning (imitation, emulation, guided practice). These diverse modes of
  "encultured knowing" transmit practical and conceptual knowledge embedded
  in cultural practices. Standard epistemology of testimony is too narrow—
  much cultural knowledge transmission occurs through participation in
  traditions rather than explicit assertion and uptake.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is crucial for understanding how traditions transmit
  knowledge beyond explicit testimony—through practices, rituals, and
  embodied participation. It shows that tradition breakdown can occur not
  just through testimonial failure but through disruption of participatory
  practices. The distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial cultural
  learning reveals different transmission mechanisms with different
  vulnerabilities, enriching our understanding of how traditions function and
  fail.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Müller develops a social epistemology specifically for
  cumulative cultural knowledge (CCK) that accumulates across generations
  through refinement and transmission. Existing testimony-focused frameworks
  inadequately capture how CCK transmits through non-testimonial cultural
  learning (observation, imitation, guided practice). Agents deserve
  epistemic credit for promoting efficient and safe transmission of their
  community's CCK, even when not engaging in explicit testimony.

  RELEVANCE: This recent work directly addresses intergenerational
  transmission of cultural knowledge—the heart of how traditions function. By
  focusing on cumulative knowledge that builds across generations, Müller
  provides tools for understanding tradition as an epistemic achievement
  beyond individual knowledge. The emphasis on transmission safety and
  efficiency helps explain how traditions maintain fidelity while also
  suggesting how transmission can fail when these conditions aren't met.

  doi = {10.1093/mind/fzz017},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Levy and Alfano argue that social epistemology hasn't been
  social enough—it remains too focused on individual epistemic agency and
  virtue. In many real-world contexts of knowledge production and
  transmission, what appear as individual epistemic vices (closed-mindedness,
  dogmatism) can function as epistemic virtues at the group level by enabling
  division of cognitive labor and stable knowledge preservation. Epistemology
  must account for deeply social and distributed cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: This radical rethinking of epistemic virtue and vice is
  important for understanding tradition. What looks like epistemic vice
  (dogmatic adherence to tradition, resistance to innovation) might sometimes
  serve the function of knowledge preservation and transmission. Conversely,
  individual epistemic virtue might undermine collective epistemic goals. This
  helps explain why traditions can be epistemically valuable despite apparent
  rigidity, and why their breakdown isn't always due to individual epistemic
  failure.

  doi = {10.47925/2016.328},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Bertucio argues that contemporary higher education's
  "critical" approach to tradition—emphasizing deconstruction and
  antagonism toward inherited knowledge—undermines substantive education.
  Drawing on Gadamer and the Catholic educator Luigi Giussani, he shows how
  tradition and authority are preconditions for critical thinking rather than
  obstacles. Students must first receive tradition to gain the conceptual
  resources needed for genuine critique, not mere negation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses the educational dimension of tradition
  transmission and the conditions under which it can fail. The critique of
  purely "critical" approaches illuminates one mode of tradition breakdown:
  when the receptive dimension necessary for transmission is rejected in
  favor of pure critique, tradition cannot be transmitted, let alone
  critically engaged. This suggests tradition requires a balance between
  authority and critical reflection.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Zhang examines the hermeneutic circle's implications for
  interpretive validity, arguing against extreme relativism that sees all
  interpretations as equally valid. The circle of part-whole interdependence
  doesn't trap us in subjectivity but enables progressively better
  understanding through dialogical engagement with texts. Textual integrity
  and interpretive community provide constraints that distinguish valid from
  invalid interpretations within tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Zhang's focus on interpretive validity addresses how traditions
  maintain coherence and correct interpretation despite the hermeneutic
  circle. This speaks to both tradition's value (it enables valid
  interpretation through shared frameworks) and potential breakdown (when
  hermeneutic circle becomes closed or interpretive community fragments,
  validity standards erode). The balance between circularity and validity is

  CORE ARGUMENT: Debesay et al. address the methodological challenge of
  justifying interpretations within the hermeneutic circle—how do we exit the
  circle to validate our interpretations? They argue that the circle never

  iterative movement between parts and whole, pre-understanding and new
  insight. Justification comes from coherence, dialogue with others, and
  openness to revision rather than escape from circularity.

  RELEVANCE: This methodological discussion illuminates the structure of
  tradition as ongoing interpretive practice. Traditions function through
  hermeneutic circles that remain open to revision—interpretation validates
  itself through coherence and dialogue rather than foundational certainty.
  This suggests tradition breakdown occurs when hermeneutic circles close
  prematurely, blocking the iterative refinement that constitutes healthy

  CORE ARGUMENT: Engler provides a comprehensive critical analysis of
  "tradition" as a concept in religious studies, examining its history,

  affirmative account by highlighting how "tradition" functions as a
  contested concept bound up with power and ideology. This is crucial for

  are actively constructed, contested, and sometimes weaponized. The

  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord explores Gadamer's concept of tradition's political
