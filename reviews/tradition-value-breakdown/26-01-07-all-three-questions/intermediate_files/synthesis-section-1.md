## Introduction

Traditions are central to political and cultural life. They shape constitutional orders, ground political identities, transmit accumulated wisdom across generations, and provide the interpretive frameworks through which communities make sense of their experience. Yet philosophical analysis of what makes traditions valuable---and what makes them go wrong---remains surprisingly fragmented. Sociologists have catalogued tradition's social functions (Shils 1981), virtue ethicists have embedded tradition within accounts of practical rationality (MacIntyre 1984), and hermeneutic philosophers have rehabilitated tradition against Enlightenment critique (Gadamer 2006; Warnke 1987). But these literatures rarely engage one another systematically, and none offers a comprehensive theory of tradition breakdown.

Three interconnected questions guide this inquiry. First, what *is* tradition conceptually? Traditions occupy an intermediate space between mere conventions (which lack temporal depth and normative weight) and fully institutionalized structures (which possess formal organizational complexity). Beckstein (2017) argues that traditions require patterns of transmission across generations, continuity despite change, and contestable criteria for authentic continuation---but how these requirements relate to convention theory and social ontology remains underexplored. Second, what normative authority do traditions possess? Conservative philosophers from Burke through Oakeshott have argued that traditions embody accumulated practical wisdom exceeding individual rational capacity, while critics from Kant through contemporary feminist philosophers have emphasized tradition's potential for perpetuating prejudice and constraining autonomy. Third, and most pressingly for this project: how do traditions degenerate, ossify, or fail? MacIntyre's (1984) distinction between "living traditions" (which sustain ongoing internal argument about their purposes) and dead ones (which calcify into mere repetition) provides conceptual resources, but systematic application to political and cultural traditions remains limited.

The stakes of this inquiry are considerable. If traditions embody accumulated wisdom, as conservative defenders argue, their breakdown represents genuine epistemic loss---the dissolution of knowledge that cannot be reconstructed from first principles. If traditions transmit meaning across generations, as hermeneutic philosophy demonstrates, their failure produces intelligibility crises in which communities lose the interpretive resources to make sense of their situation. The contemporary moment, marked by contested claims about tradition's value and widespread anxiety about cultural fragmentation, makes these questions urgent.

The literature reveals a productive tension between conservative defenses emphasizing tradition's epistemic and identity-constituting value and critical perspectives emphasizing tradition's potential for oppression and heteronomy. The most sophisticated positions on both sides recognize that this tension cannot be resolved by simply choosing sides. Relational autonomy approaches show how traditions can constitute conditions for meaningful agency while also constraining it; dialectical critiques reveal that pure anti-traditionalism is self-defeating. This review maps these debates while identifying systematic gaps in our understanding of how traditions fail.

The scope is philosophical rather than sociological, though it engages key sociological works where they illuminate conceptual questions. The emphasis falls on political and cultural traditions rather than religious ones, though these categories inevitably overlap. The goal is not encyclopedic coverage but analytical synthesis: identifying the key debates, revealing productive tensions, and specifying gaps that a theory of tradition breakdown must address.
