====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The conceptual analysis of tradition remains surprisingly under-developed
in contemporary analytic philosophy, despite tradition's centrality to
social and political philosophy. The domain divides into three main
approaches: (1) Lewis-inspired convention theory that treats traditions
as coordination equilibria; (2) social ontology approaches examining
traditions as practices, norms, or institutions; and (3) direct
conceptual analysis attempting to define tradition and distinguish it
from related phenomena.

Key debates center on: whether traditions are essentially temporally
extended (requiring transmission across generations); whether they are
primarily normative (prescribing action) or descriptive (patterns of
behavior); and how to distinguish traditions from customs, conventions,
habits, and institutions. Beckstein (2017) provides the most systematic
recent treatment, arguing that traditions must exhibit both continuity
and authentic continuation criteria. Shils (1981) remains foundational
despite being sociological rather than strictly philosophical. The SEP
entries on convention (Lewis, Marmor), social norms (Bicchieri), and
social institutions (Searle, Miller) provide rich conceptual resources
but rarely address tradition directly.

Recent work shows renewed interest in tradition's role in practical
rationality (MacIntyre's influence persists) and in political philosophy
(debates over conservatism, multiculturalism). However, there remains
no consensus "theory of tradition" comparable to Lewis on convention or
Searle on institutions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential conceptual foundations for understanding
what traditions ARE before investigating their value or breakdown. The
distinction between traditions and mere customs/conventions matters
critically: if traditions require authentic continuation and meaningful
transmission (not just behavioral repetition), then questions of
degeneration become more tractable. The temporal extension requirement
connects to issues of tradition identity over time—crucial for asking
when a tradition has "failed" versus merely evolved.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Surprisingly little work directly engages the ontology of traditions.
Most philosophical work treats traditions as examples within broader
theories (of convention, practice, social ontology) rather than
analyzing the concept itself. The relationship between tradition and
temporal extension needs more rigorous treatment. Very limited engagement
with cross-cultural conceptions of tradition beyond Western philosophy.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Begin with Lewis/convention theory to establish baseline (traditions as
regularity + common knowledge), then examine why this is insufficient
(Beckstein's critique). Use Shils for typology and MacIntyre for
practice-based alternative. SEP entries provide the broader conceptual
landscape (institutions, practices, norms) within which traditions sit.
The synthesis should emphasize that conceptual clarity here is
prerequisite to normative analysis in other domains.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Convention-theoretic: 4 papers - Traditions as coordination equilibria (Lewis, Marmor)
- Practice-based: 5 papers - Traditions as practices requiring transmission (MacIntyre, Beckstein)
- Social ontology: 6 papers - Traditions as social institutions/norms (Searle, Tuomela, Miller)

@book{lewis1969convention,
  author = {Lewis, David K.},
  title = {Convention: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {1969},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conventions are solutions to recurring coordination problems,
  sustained by common knowledge that everyone expects everyone else to conform.
  A convention is a regularity R in behavior such that: everyone conforms to R,
  everyone expects everyone else to conform to R, everyone prefers to conform to
  R on condition that others do, and there exists at least one alternative
  regularity that could serve the same function. This game-theoretic analysis
  provides necessary and sufficient conditions for conventional phenomena.

  RELEVANCE: Lewis provides the dominant analytical framework for understanding
  conventional phenomena. If traditions are a species of convention, they inherit
  this structure—implying traditions rest on coordination and mutual
  expectations rather than inherent authority or value. However, Lewis's account
  may be insufficient for traditions: conventions can arise quickly and
  dissolve easily, while traditions seem to require temporal extension and
  transmission. The project must examine whether traditions are conventions,
  sub-conventions, or distinct phenomena requiring different conceptual apparatus.

  POSITION: Foundational convention theory using game-theoretic analysis;
  establishes baseline for analyzing tradition as potential convention type.

@article{beckstein2017living,
  author = {Beckstein, Martin},
  title = {The concept of a living tradition},
  journal = {European Journal of Social Theory},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {20},
  number = {4},
  pages = {491--510},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditions are temporally extended practices characterized by
  (1) a pattern of transmission across generations, (2) continuity despite
  change, and (3) criteria for authentic continuation that practitioners
  recognize and contest. Beckstein argues that conventions (Lewis) and habits
  lack the necessary temporal extension and transmission structure. Traditions
  must allow for development while maintaining identity—hence "living"
  traditions. The concept requires distinguishing tradition-constitutive
  features from accidental historical accretions, but this distinction is
  itself contestable within the tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This is the most systematic recent philosophical treatment of
  tradition as a concept. Beckstein directly addresses the project's central
  question: what makes something a tradition versus a custom or convention?
  His "living tradition" framework provides conceptual tools for analyzing
  tradition degeneration: a tradition fails when it loses authentic
  continuation (becomes ossified) or transmission breaks down. The emphasis
  on contestation within tradition is crucial for understanding how traditions
  evolve without losing identity. Essential for domain 1's conceptual analysis.

  POSITION: Most important recent systematic conceptual analysis of tradition;
  argues for practice-based account with temporal extension as essential.

@book{shils1981tradition,
  author = {Shils, Edward},
  title = {Tradition},
  year = {1981},
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  address = {Chicago},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traditions are patterns of belief, practice, or institution
  that are handed down from the past and possess authority by virtue of their
  having been handed down. Shils provides a typology: substantive traditions
  (beliefs, practices) versus formal traditions (patterns of relationship),
  and varying orientations toward tradition (traditionalistic,
  traditionalist, antitraditional). Traditions function to connect present
  to past, providing continuity and identity. All societies contain multiple,
  often competing traditions; even "revolutionary" movements establish their
  own traditions.

  RELEVANCE: Though sociological rather than strictly philosophical, Shils
  remains the most comprehensive single-volume treatment of tradition. His
  typology illuminates how traditions operate across different domains (law,
  religion, science, politics). For the project, Shils's account of how
  traditions gain and lose authority is crucial—authority derives partly from
  pastness itself, but also from perceived continuity with valued origins.
  His analysis of "traditionalism" (rigid attachment to tradition) versus
  healthy tradition-maintenance informs questions of when traditions calcify
  versus adapt. Foundational text despite being 40+ years old.

  POSITION: Sociological approach emphasizing tradition's role in social
  integration and authority; provides influential typology still referenced.

@article{jacobs2007edward,
  author = {Jacobs, Struan},
  title = {Edward Shils' Theory of Tradition},
  journal = {Philosophy of the Social Sciences},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {37},
  number = {2},
  pages = {139--162},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393107299685},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs provides critical exposition of Shils's multifaceted
  theory of tradition, identifying four distinct perspectives: pragmatic
  (traditions as solutions to recurrent problems), Burkean (traditions embody
  accumulated wisdom), veridical (traditions transmit truth/reality), and
  evolutionist (traditions as survival-tested practices). Jacobs argues these
  perspectives are not fully integrated in Shils's work, creating tensions—
  especially between the pragmatic view (traditions as contingent solutions)
  and the veridical view (traditions as truth-bearing).

  RELEVANCE: Essential secondary literature for understanding Shils's complex
  position. Jacobs's analysis reveals how even the most comprehensive theory
  of tradition contains unresolved conceptual tensions. For the project, this
  matters because different perspectives on tradition imply different criteria
  for failure/degeneration: pragmatic view suggests traditions fail when they
  no longer solve problems; veridical view suggests they fail when they
  distort truth; Burkean view suggests they fail when connection to past
  wisdom is severed. The project's theory of tradition-breakdown must
  address these distinct failure modes.

  POSITION: Critical exposition of Shils revealing internal tensions in
  tradition theory; important secondary literature on foundational text.

@book{marmor2009social,
  author = {Marmor, Andrei},
  title = {Social Conventions: From Language to Law},
  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Conventions are arbitrary behavioral regularities constituted
  by reasons for action that are both self-perpetuating and content-independent.
  Marmor distinguishes "shallow" conventions (Lewis-type coordination) from
  "deep" conventions (constitutive of practices like language, law). Deep
  conventions generate new reasons for action and cannot be easily changed
  by individual or even collective decision. Language is the paradigm case:
  linguistic conventions are arbitrary yet normatively binding, learned
  through participation rather than explicit agreement.

  RELEVANCE: Marmor's distinction between shallow and deep conventions is
  crucial for understanding traditions. If traditions are deep conventions,
  they possess normative force not reducible to coordination benefits, and
  their "arbitrariness" is compatible with their authority. This helps explain
  why traditions persist even when their original functions are unclear:
  they constitute practices we cannot easily exit. For tradition-breakdown,
  the question becomes: when do deep conventions lose their constitutive power?
  When participants no longer recognize them as authoritative, or when
  participation itself breaks down?

  POSITION: Extends Lewis's convention theory to "deep" conventions with
  constitutive rather than merely coordinative function; important for
  understanding tradition's normative force.

@book{searle1995construction,
  author = {Searle, John R.},
  title = {The Construction of Social Reality},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {Free Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social reality consists of institutional facts created by
  collective intentionality and constitutive rules of the form "X counts as Y
  in context C." Institutions are systems of such constitutive rules. Money,
  property, marriage, government all exemplify institutional facts: they exist
  only because we collectively accept them as existing and assign them
  status-functions. Collective intentionality (we-intentions) is primitive,
  not reducible to individual intentionality. Language is the fundamental
  social institution enabling all others.

  RELEVANCE: Searle provides the dominant analytical framework for social
  ontology of institutions. If traditions are social institutions (or contain
  institutional elements), they inherit this structure: collective acceptance
  creates institutional reality. However, Searle's account emphasizes synchronic
  structure (collective acceptance at t) while traditions essentially involve
  diachronic transmission. The project must examine: Are traditions institutions?
  Do they require special forms of collective intentionality oriented toward
  the past? How does collective acceptance of tradition differ from collective
  acceptance of current institutions? Searle rarely discusses tradition directly.

  POSITION: Foundational social ontology providing constitutive-rule analysis
  of institutional reality; paradigm for analyzing tradition as institution.

@book{bicchieri2006grammar,
  author = {Bicchieri, Cristina},
  title = {The Grammar of Society: The Nature and Dynamics of Social Norms},
  year = {2006},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511616037},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social norms are behavioral rules supported by empirical
  and normative expectations: people follow norm N if they believe (1) others
  follow N (empirical expectation), (2) others expect them to follow N and
  may sanction non-compliance (normative expectation), and (3) they prefer
  to follow N conditional on (1) and (2). This distinguishes social norms
  from conventions (lack normative force), moral rules (independent of
  others' expectations), and descriptive norms (mere regularities). Social
  norms are self-enforcing through mutual expectations rather than external
  enforcement.

  RELEVANCE: Bicchieri's framework helps distinguish traditions from norms
  and conventions. Are traditions social norms? Partly: they involve normative
  expectations and sanctions for non-compliance. But traditions seem to involve
  additional elements: connection to the past, transmission, and claims to
  authority based on antiquity rather than just mutual expectations. For
  tradition-breakdown, Bicchieri's analysis of how norms unravel (when
  expectations become misaligned) may illuminate how traditions fail: when
  transmission breaks down, empirical and normative expectations diverge,
  undermining the norm.

  POSITION: Game-theoretic and experimental approach to social norms;
  distinguishes norms from conventions and moral rules through expectation
  structure.

@book{miller2010moral,
  author = {Miller, Seumas},
  title = {The Moral Foundations of Social Institutions: A Philosophical Study},
  year = {2010},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social institutions are organizations or systems of
  organizations embodying collective ends pursued through joint activity
  according to constitutive and regulative rules. Institutions have both
  structure (roles, rules) and function (collective ends). Miller's teleological
  account emphasizes that institutions exist to serve collective ends—these
  ends provide both explanation and normative standard. Institutions require
  joint action (multiple agents acting interdependently toward shared goal)
  sustained across time through mechanisms ensuring coordination and
  perpetuation.

  RELEVANCE: Miller's teleological approach differs from Searle's constitutive-
  rule approach, emphasizing collective ends over collective acceptance. For
  traditions, this raises: Do traditions have collective ends? Or do they
  simply perpetuate practices whose original ends are lost? If traditions lack
  clear collective ends, Miller's framework may not apply. However, his
  emphasis on joint action sustained over time captures tradition's diachronic
  character better than Searle. For breakdown: traditions fail when collective
  ends become unclear or when joint action mechanisms fail to perpetuate
  the practice across generations.

  POSITION: Teleological account of social institutions emphasizing collective
  ends and joint action; alternative to Searle's constitutive-rule approach.

@incollection{gilbert1989social,
  author = {Gilbert, Margaret},
  title = {On Social Facts},
  year = {1989},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  address = {London},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social phenomena require "plural subjects"—multiple persons
  constituting, by virtue of joint commitment, a single subject of attitudes
  and actions. Joint commitments create obligations among participants that
  individuals cannot unilaterally rescind. This differs from aggregate views
  (social facts = aggregated individual facts) and collective intentionality
  views (Searle). Gilbert emphasizes the normative structure: joint commitment
  creates obligations to each other, giving participants standing to rebuke
  non-compliance. Walking together, believing together, intending together
  all involve plural subject structure.

  RELEVANCE: Gilbert's plural subject theory may illuminate traditions as joint
  commitments extended across time: participants are jointly committed to
  maintaining and transmitting the practice, creating obligations to past and
  future participants. This explains tradition's normative force without appeal
  to inherent value—the force comes from joint commitment structure. For
  breakdown: traditions fail when joint commitments dissolve, when participants
  no longer recognize obligations to each other (past/future). However, Gilbert
  rarely discusses temporal extension or intergenerational joint commitments.

  POSITION: Plural subject theory of social phenomena emphasizing joint
  commitment and normative obligations among participants.

@book{tuomela2002philosophy,
  author = {Tuomela, Raimo},
  title = {The Philosophy of Social Practices: A Collective Acceptance View},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social practices are systems of rule-governed activities
  based on collective acceptance. Collective acceptance (accepting something
  "as a group") creates social reality through we-mode thinking (distinct
  from mere I-mode aggregation). Practices are ontologically collective:
  they exist only when collectively accepted and maintained. Tuomela
  distinguishes constitutive and regulative social practices, emphasizes
  positional roles and deontic powers, and argues we-mode collective
  acceptance is necessary for full-blooded social practices.

  RELEVANCE: Tuomela's collective acceptance view, like Searle's, emphasizes
  synchronic structure. For traditions, the question is whether collective
  acceptance must be oriented toward the past or whether present collective
  acceptance suffices. If tradition requires accepting something "because it
  was handed down," this involves distinct intentional content from accepting
  something for current reasons. Tuomela's framework illuminates how practices
  are collectively maintained but may need supplementation to handle diachronic
  transmission. For breakdown: traditions fail when collective acceptance
  lapses or shifts from we-mode to I-mode.

  POSITION: Collective acceptance theory emphasizing we-mode versus I-mode
  collective intentionality; social practices exist through being collectively
  accepted.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of philosophical theories of convention
  from Lewis through contemporary debates. Covers Lewis's game-theoretic
  analysis, criticisms emphasizing common knowledge requirements, alternative
  approaches (Millikan's copying account, evolutionary game theory), and
  applications to language. Key debate: whether conventions require common
  knowledge or merely sufficient mutual expectations for coordination. Also
  addresses relationship between conventions and norms, rules, and practices.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic overview of the convention-theoretic landscape
  within which any convention-based account of tradition must be situated.
  The article's discussion of how conventions relate to norms and practices
  is directly relevant: if traditions are conventions-plus-X, what is X?
  The tension between Lewis-style common knowledge requirements and more
  permissive accounts matters for traditions: do participants need common
  knowledge of tradition, or suffices that they participate without explicit

  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/social-norms/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Social norms are distinguished from conventions, moral norms,
  and descriptive regularities by their expectation structure: both empirical
  (beliefs about what others do) and normative (beliefs about what others
  expect and approve). Article surveys game-theoretic, evolutionary, and
  psychological approaches to norms. Discusses norm emergence, maintenance,
  and change; role of sanctions; relationship to social preferences. Key
  distinction: norms have intrinsic normative force through expectations,
  while conventions solve coordination problems without such force.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for distinguishing traditions from norms. The article's
  analysis of norm change and dissolution is particularly relevant: norms can
  unravel when expectations become misaligned or when sanctions cease. If
  traditions have norm-like structure, similar mechanisms may explain tradition-
  breakdown. However, traditions seem to involve additional temporal dimension:
  connection to past, not just present expectations. The article's discussion
  of "bad norms" (persistent despite being harmful) may illuminate why
  traditions persist even when dysfunctional.

  expectation-based approach following Bicchieri.

  publisher = {Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University},
  edition = {Summer 2019},
  url = {https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/social-institutions/},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of philosophical theories of social
  institutions: atomistic (institutions reducible to individual attitudes/
  actions), collective acceptance (Searle, Tuomela), and teleological (Miller).
  Discusses structure (roles, rules), function (collective ends), and
  normative questions (justice, legitimacy). Institutions are distinguished
  from mere conventions and norms by their organizational complexity,
  durability, and role in structuring social life. Key debates: methodological
  individualism versus holism, constitutive rules versus collective ends.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic framework for asking whether traditions are
  social institutions or constitute a distinct category. The article's
  distinction between institutions and conventions is crucial: institutions
  are complex, enduring, organized structures serving collective ends; conventions
  are simpler coordination devices. Traditions seem intermediate: more complex
  than conventions but perhaps less organizationally structured than paradigm
  institutions (governments, corporations). The article's discussion of
  institutional persistence illuminates tradition-maintenance mechanisms.

  institutions; favors teleological approach emphasizing collective ends.

  year = {1984},
  edition = {2nd},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Virtues are dispositions acquired through participation in
  social practices—cooperative activities with goods internal to the practice
  and standards of excellence recognized by practitioners. Practices require
  traditions: narrative continuities connecting past, present, and future,
  transmitting and developing standards of excellence. Traditions provide
  context for rational inquiry: what counts as good reason depends on
  tradition-specific standards. Living traditions involve ongoing argument
  about what the tradition requires—they are "historically extended,
  socially embodied arguments."

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre provides the most influential philosophical account
  of traditions as contexts for practical rationality. His practice-based
  view emphasizes that traditions are not static repositories but dynamic
  arguments. For the project, MacIntyre's account of tradition-constituted
  rationality is crucial: if rationality is tradition-dependent, tradition-
  breakdown threatens rational inquiry itself. His concept of "practices"
  with internal goods provides framework for asking when traditions degenerate:
  when connection between practice and internal goods is severed, when
  external goods (power, wealth) corrupt the practice. Essential but requires
  critical engagement.

  POSITION: Most influential contemporary philosophical account of tradition;
  emphasizes tradition-constituted rationality and practices with internal goods.

  volume = {9},
  number = {1},
  pages = {21--49},
  doi = {10.1163/18722636-12341287},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre offer fundamentally different
  views of tradition despite all being "traditionalist" thinkers. Arendt sees
  tradition as transmission of foundational political experience (Roman
  authority, Greek philosophy, Hebrew religion) that modernity has broken.
  Oakeshott sees tradition as unreflective practical knowledge embedded in
  customs and practices. MacIntyre sees tradition as rational argument extended
  across generations about how to achieve goods. These views imply different
  accounts of tradition-breakdown: for Arendt, violent rupture; for Oakeshott,
  rationalist interference; for MacIntyre, epistemic crisis within tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis illuminates how "tradition" is contested
  even among philosophers who valorize it. For the project, Alexander's
  distinction matters because different views of what traditions ARE imply
  different theories of how they fail. The article shows that conceptual
  analysis of tradition cannot be neutral—it already involves taking sides
  on substantive questions about rationality, modernity, and political order.
  Important for recognizing that domain 1 (conceptual analysis) cannot be
  fully separated from domain 2 (normative value).

@incollection{bratman2022institutional,
  author = {Bratman, Michael},
  title = {Shared and Institutional Agency: Toward a Planning Theory of Human Practical Organization},
  year = {2022},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Shared agency involves interlocking intentions, mutual
  responsiveness, and commitment to shared activity. Institutional agency
  extends shared agency through role-governed structures: agents occupy roles
  with associated norms, coordinate through role-awareness, and sustain
  institutions through planning-like structures of interconnected policies.
  Bratman's planning theory explains how institutions persist across membership
  changes: the planning structure remains while individual participants change.
  Emphasizes procedural coordination rather than collective ends or collective
  acceptance.

  RELEVANCE: Bratman's planning-theoretic approach may illuminate traditions
  as intergenerational planning structures: earlier generations create policies
  (practices, norms) that later generations inherit and adapt. The emphasis
  on procedural coordination without requiring shared collective ends fits
  traditions where original purposes are lost but practices continue. For
  breakdown: traditions fail when planning structures no longer coordinate
  action across generations, when interlocking intentions dissolve. Bratman
  rarely discusses temporal extension or intergenerational structures explicitly,
  but framework is adaptable.
