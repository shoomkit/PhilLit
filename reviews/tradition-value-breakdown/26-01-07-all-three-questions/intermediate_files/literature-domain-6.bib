====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how traditions transmit knowledge and meaning across
generations through the lenses of philosophical hermeneutics and social
epistemology. Gadamer's hermeneutic philosophy provides the foundational
framework, particularly his rehabilitation of prejudice, authority, and
tradition, and his concepts of effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte) and
the hermeneutic circle. These ideas challenge Enlightenment skepticism
toward tradition by showing how our historical situatedness enables rather
than impedes understanding. The hermeneutic circle—the interdependence of
part and whole in interpretation—reveals how tradition shapes our
pre-understanding while remaining open to revision through dialogical
encounter.

Recent work extends this hermeneutic foundation into social epistemology,
examining how cultural knowledge accumulates and transmits through both
testimonial and non-testimonial learning. Debates concern whether Gadamer's
account is inherently conservative, how testimony differs from other forms
of cultural learning, and whether traditions can be both authoritative and
subject to critical revision. The intersection with epistemology of
testimony raises questions about the unique epistemic status of
tradition-mediated knowledge versus other forms of social learning.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question of how traditions
function as vehicles for intergenerational knowledge transmission.
Gadamer's concepts of effective history and the hermeneutic circle provide
philosophical frameworks for understanding both the value of traditions
(their role in enabling understanding) and their potential defects (when
the hermeneutic circle becomes closed or distorted). The social
epistemology literature extends this by examining the social structures and
epistemic norms that govern tradition transmission, helping to explain how
traditions can maintain authority while also becoming defective or breaking
down.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition is well-covered, less work
explicitly theorizes the conditions under which traditions fail, degenerate,
or become pathological. The social epistemology literature focuses more on
successful transmission than on breakdown mechanisms. More work needed on
the intersection between hermeneutic accounts of tradition and empirical
studies of cultural transmission failure.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, emphasize how Gadamer's hermeneutic concepts provide
philosophical grounding for understanding tradition's epistemic value, then
show how social epistemology work extends this by examining the social
conditions and practices of transmission. The debate over whether Gadamer's
view is inherently conservative connects to questions about how traditions
can change or become defective. Consider contrasting testimonial vs.
non-testimonial cultural learning as different modes of tradition
transmission with different vulnerabilities.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Gadamerian hermeneutics (6 papers): Tradition as enabling condition for
  understanding; effective history as dialogical engagement with past
- Social epistemology of transmission (5 papers): Focus on epistemic norms
  and social structures governing knowledge transmission
- Critical perspectives (4 papers): Questions about conservatism,
  authority, and the limits of tradition-based understanding

@article{gadamer2006looking,
  author = {Gadamer, Hans-Georg and Grondin, Jean},
  title = {Looking Back with Gadamer Over his Writings and their Effective History},
  journal = {Theory, Culture \& Society},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {85--100},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276406063230},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gadamer reflects retrospectively on the development and
  reception of his hermeneutic philosophy, particularly the concept of
  effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte) and its impact on understanding how
  interpretation is always shaped by the historical effects of what we
  interpret. He explains how his work sought to reveal the inescapability of
  historical consciousness and the productive role of prejudice in
  understanding, countering Enlightenment notions that prejudices only
  obstruct truth.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides Gadamer's own retrospective account of his
  central concepts, making it essential for understanding effective history
  as the mechanism by which tradition shapes understanding. It directly
  addresses how tradition functions as an ongoing dialogue between past and
  present, which is crucial for explaining both tradition's value and how it
  can evolve or become distorted. The concept of effective history is key to
  understanding how traditions transmit meaning while remaining open to
  reinterpretation.

  POSITION: Gadamerian hermeneutics - affirms tradition as dialogical and
  historically situated rather than static or purely conservative.

  title = {Between Strangeness and Familiarity: Towards Gadamer's Conception of Effective History},
  journal = {Research in Phenomenology},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {121--136},
  doi = {10.1163/1569164042404626},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gander analyzes Gadamer's concept of effective history by
  showing how it mediates between the strangeness of historical distance and
  the familiarity of our own historicity. Understanding requires recognizing
  both the otherness of tradition and our participation in it. The tension
  between distance and belonging is productive rather than a barrier,
  enabling the fusion of horizons that characterizes genuine understanding.

  RELEVANCE: This explication of effective history's dual structure
  (strangeness and familiarity) illuminates how tradition functions
  epistemically—it provides the background understanding that makes
  interpretation possible while also presenting something foreign that
  challenges our assumptions. This tension is crucial for understanding how
  traditions can transmit knowledge while also evolving, and how they might
  break down when either pole (familiarity or strangeness) dominates
  pathologically.

  POSITION: Gadamerian interpretation focusing on the dialectical structure
  of effective history.

@article{leiviska2015relevance,
  author = {Leiviskä, Anniina},
  title = {The Relevance of Hans-Georg Gadamer's Concept of Tradition to the Philosophy of Education},
  journal = {Educational Theory},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {65},
  pages = {581--600},
  doi = {10.1111/EDTH.12135},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Leiviskä argues that Gadamer's rehabilitation of tradition
  offers a philosophically rich account of educational transmission that
  avoids both uncritical acceptance and complete rejection of inherited
  knowledge. Education involves initiation into traditions that provide the
  conceptual resources for understanding, while simultaneously cultivating
  the critical capacity to question and revise those traditions. The
  hermeneutic circle is central: students must provisionally accept
  tradition to gain the understanding needed to critically evaluate it.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges Gadamerian hermeneutics and the practical
  question of how traditions are transmitted across generations through
  education. It shows how tradition functions as both authoritative (enabling
  understanding) and open to critique, addressing the project's concern with
  both the value of traditions and how they can change or become defective.
  The educational context makes explicit the intergenerational transmission
  mechanisms that underlie all tradition.

  POSITION: Applied Gadamerian hermeneutics in educational philosophy.

@incollection{atkinson2009gadamer,
  author = {Atkinson, Camille E.},
  title = {Is Gadamer's Hermeneutics Inherently Conservative?},
  booktitle = {Forum Philosophicum: International Journal for Philosophy},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {14},
  pages = {285--306},
  doi = {10.5840/forphil200914220},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Atkinson defends Gadamer against critics like Warnke and
  Caputo who argue his hermeneutics is inherently conservative because it
  emphasizes tradition's authority. She argues that Gadamer's concept of
  tradition is dialogical and critical: tradition provides the
  pre-understanding necessary for critique, but understanding requires
  actively questioning and testing prejudices through encounter with texts
  and interlocutors. Tradition is a living conversation, not static dogma.

  RELEVANCE: This debate about conservatism directly addresses whether
  Gadamer's account can explain tradition breakdown and defect. If tradition
  merely preserves without critique, it cannot account for needed change or
  evolution. Atkinson's defense shows how the hermeneutic framework includes
  resources for critical engagement with tradition, making it relevant to
  understanding both tradition's value and its potential pathologies when
  dialogue closes down.

  POSITION: Defense of Gadamer against charges of conservatism; emphasizes
  critical and dialogical dimensions of tradition.

@book{warnke1987gadamer,
  author = {Warnke, Georgia},
  title = {Gadamer: Hermeneutics, Tradition and Reason},
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  year = {1987},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Warnke provides a comprehensive reconstruction of Gadamer's
  hermeneutic philosophy, examining how his concepts of tradition, prejudice,
  effective history, and the hermeneutic circle constitute a distinctive
  account of rationality. She critically explores tensions in Gadamer's
  thought, particularly whether his emphasis on tradition's authority leaves
  sufficient room for critical distance and rational revision of inherited
  beliefs. Tradition is both the condition of understanding and potentially
  constraining.

  RELEVANCE: As a major systematic treatment of Gadamer's philosophy, this
  book provides essential background for understanding hermeneutic approaches
  to tradition. Warnke's critical analysis of tensions in Gadamer's account
  is particularly relevant to the project's concern with tradition breakdown—
  she explores how tradition can be both enabling and limiting, and when its
  authority becomes problematic. Her discussion of reason and tradition
  connects hermeneutics to broader epistemological questions.

  POSITION: Sympathetic but critical interpretation of Gadamerian
  hermeneutics.

  title = {Art, History, and the Decline of Tradition},
  journal = {Journal of the History of Philosophy},
  year = {2017},
  pages = {33--62},
  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-59558-0_2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Odenstedt examines Gadamer's concept of tradition
  specifically in relation to art history, showing how modernity represents a
  qualitative shift in tradition's functioning. Where pre-modern traditions
  operated through relatively stable transmission, modern fragmentation and
  self-consciousness about tradition alter the hermeneutic situation. The
  "decline of tradition" doesn't mean tradition disappears but that its mode
  of operation becomes problematic, requiring more explicit reflection and
  reconstruction.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses tradition breakdown and
  degeneration—the project's core concern with how traditions "go wrong."
  Odenstedt's analysis of modernity's impact on tradition provides historical
  and conceptual resources for understanding tradition defect as a structural
  phenomenon rather than mere contingent failure. The shift from organic to
  self-conscious tradition transmission illuminates different vulnerabilities.

  POSITION: Historical analysis of tradition's transformation in modernity
  within Gadamerian framework.

@article{greco2020transmission,
  author = {Greco, John},
  title = {The Transmission of Knowledge},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1017/9781108560818},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Greco develops a social epistemology of knowledge
  transmission distinct from knowledge generation, arguing that transmission
  depends on interpersonal trust and cooperative social structures rather
  than individual evidence-gathering. Drawing on virtue epistemology and
  action theory, he models transmission as a form of shared agency (like
  giving a gift or passing a ball) requiring both giver and receiver to play
  their epistemic roles properly. Social context determines whether
  transmission succeeds or fails.

  RELEVANCE: Greco's framework provides social-epistemological tools for
  understanding tradition as a form of knowledge transmission across
  generations. His emphasis on trust, cooperation, and social structures
  helps explain both how traditions successfully transmit knowledge and how
  they can break down when trust erodes or cooperation fails. The distinction
  between transmission and generation is crucial for understanding tradition's
  unique epistemic role and vulnerabilities.

  POSITION: Social epistemology of testimony and knowledge transmission using
  virtue-theoretic framework.

@article{mcmyler2022encultured,
  author = {McMyler, Benjamin},
  title = {Encultured knowing: knowledge transmission and varieties of cultural learning},
  journal = {Synthese},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {200},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-022-03876-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMyler argues that cultural knowledge transmission extends
  beyond paradigmatic testimony to include non-testimonial forms of cultural
  learning (imitation, emulation, guided practice). These diverse modes of
  "encultured knowing" transmit practical and conceptual knowledge embedded
  in cultural practices. Standard epistemology of testimony is too narrow—
  much cultural knowledge transmission occurs through participation in
  traditions rather than explicit assertion and uptake.

  RELEVANCE: This paper is crucial for understanding how traditions transmit
  knowledge beyond explicit testimony—through practices, rituals, and
  embodied participation. It shows that tradition breakdown can occur not
  just through testimonial failure but through disruption of participatory
  practices. The distinction between testimonial and non-testimonial cultural
  learning reveals different transmission mechanisms with different
  vulnerabilities, enriching our understanding of how traditions function and
  fail.

  POSITION: Extension of social epistemology beyond testimony to encompass
  broader cultural learning.

@article{muller2024transmission,
  author = {Müller, Basil},
  title = {The Transmission of Cumulative Cultural Knowledge—Towards a Social Epistemology of Non-Testimonial Cultural Learning},
  journal = {Social Epistemology},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {39},
  pages = {496--516},
  doi = {10.1080/02691728.2024.2356588},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Müller develops a social epistemology specifically for
  cumulative cultural knowledge (CCK) that accumulates across generations
  through refinement and transmission. Existing testimony-focused frameworks
  inadequately capture how CCK transmits through non-testimonial cultural
  learning (observation, imitation, guided practice). Agents deserve
  epistemic credit for promoting efficient and safe transmission of their
  community's CCK, even when not engaging in explicit testimony.

  RELEVANCE: This recent work directly addresses intergenerational
  transmission of cultural knowledge—the heart of how traditions function. By
  focusing on cumulative knowledge that builds across generations, Müller
  provides tools for understanding tradition as an epistemic achievement
  beyond individual knowledge. The emphasis on transmission safety and
  efficiency helps explain how traditions maintain fidelity while also
  suggesting how transmission can fail when these conditions aren't met.

  POSITION: Social epistemology of cumulative cultural knowledge extending
  beyond testimony.

@article{levy2019knowledge,
  author = {Levy, Neil and Alfano, Mark},
  title = {Knowledge From Vice: Deeply Social Epistemology},
  journal = {Mind},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {128},
  pages = {887--915},
  doi = {10.1093/mind/fzz017},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Levy and Alfano argue that social epistemology hasn't been
  social enough—it remains too focused on individual epistemic agency and
  virtue. In many real-world contexts of knowledge production and
  transmission, what appear as individual epistemic vices (closed-mindedness,
  dogmatism) can function as epistemic virtues at the group level by enabling
  division of cognitive labor and stable knowledge preservation. Epistemology
  must account for deeply social and distributed cognitive processes.

  RELEVANCE: This radical rethinking of epistemic virtue and vice is
  important for understanding tradition. What looks like epistemic vice
  (dogmatic adherence to tradition, resistance to innovation) might sometimes
  serve the function of knowledge preservation and transmission. Conversely,
  individual epistemic virtue might undermine collective epistemic goals. This
  helps explain why traditions can be epistemically valuable despite apparent
  rigidity, and why their breakdown isn't always due to individual epistemic
  failure.

  POSITION: Deeply social epistemology challenging individual-focused virtue
  epistemology.

@article{bertucio2018tradition,

  title = {Tradition, Authority, and Education: Insights from Gadamer and Giussani},
  journal = {Philosophy of Education},
  year = {2018},
  pages = {328--346},
  doi = {10.47925/2016.328},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bertucio argues that contemporary higher education's
  "critical" approach to tradition—emphasizing deconstruction and
  antagonism toward inherited knowledge—undermines substantive education.
  Drawing on Gadamer and the Catholic educator Luigi Giussani, he shows how
  tradition and authority are preconditions for critical thinking rather than
  obstacles. Students must first receive tradition to gain the conceptual
  resources needed for genuine critique, not mere negation.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses the educational dimension of tradition
  transmission and the conditions under which it can fail. The critique of
  purely "critical" approaches illuminates one mode of tradition breakdown:
  when the receptive dimension necessary for transmission is rejected in
  favor of pure critique, tradition cannot be transmitted, let alone
  critically engaged. This suggests tradition requires a balance between
  authority and critical reflection.

  POSITION: Defense of tradition and authority in education drawing on
  Gadamerian hermeneutics.

@article{zhang2018hermeneutic,
  author = {Zhang, Longxi},
  title = {The Hermeneutic Circle, Textual Integrity, and the Validity of Interpretation},
  journal = {Comparative Literature Studies},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {55},
  pages = {449--467},
  doi = {10.5325/complitstudies.55.3.0449},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zhang examines the hermeneutic circle's implications for
  interpretive validity, arguing against extreme relativism that sees all
  interpretations as equally valid. The circle of part-whole interdependence
  doesn't trap us in subjectivity but enables progressively better
  understanding through dialogical engagement with texts. Textual integrity
  and interpretive community provide constraints that distinguish valid from
  invalid interpretations within tradition.

  RELEVANCE: Zhang's focus on interpretive validity addresses how traditions
  maintain coherence and correct interpretation despite the hermeneutic
  circle. This speaks to both tradition's value (it enables valid
  interpretation through shared frameworks) and potential breakdown (when
  hermeneutic circle becomes closed or interpretive community fragments,
  validity standards erode). The balance between circularity and validity is
  crucial for understanding tradition's epistemic function.

  POSITION: Moderate hermeneutic position defending interpretive validity
  against relativism.

  journal = {Nursing Inquiry},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {57--66},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1440-1800.2008.00390.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Debesay et al. address the methodological challenge of
  justifying interpretations within the hermeneutic circle—how do we exit the
  circle to validate our interpretations? They argue that the circle never
  fully closes but spirals progressively toward better understanding through
  iterative movement between parts and whole, pre-understanding and new
  insight. Justification comes from coherence, dialogue with others, and
  openness to revision rather than escape from circularity.

  RELEVANCE: This methodological discussion illuminates the structure of
  tradition as ongoing interpretive practice. Traditions function through
  hermeneutic circles that remain open to revision—interpretation validates
  itself through coherence and dialogue rather than foundational certainty.
  This suggests tradition breakdown occurs when hermeneutic circles close
  prematurely, blocking the iterative refinement that constitutes healthy
  tradition. The paper shows how circularity can be productive rather than
  vicious.

  publisher = {Equinox Publishing},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1558/isbn.9781781799093},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Engler provides a comprehensive critical analysis of
  "tradition" as a concept in religious studies, examining its history,
  theoretical perspectives (including Gadamerian hermeneutics, Assmann's
  cultural memory, cognitive science), and ideological deployments. He argues
  against using "tradition" merely as synonym for "religion" and advocates a
  relational, ideology-critical approach that attends to power dynamics in
  tradition construction and maintenance. Special attention to colonial
  contexts and Indigenous perspectives.

  RELEVANCE: Engler's critical approach complements Gadamer's more
  affirmative account by highlighting how "tradition" functions as a
  contested concept bound up with power and ideology. This is crucial for
  understanding tradition breakdown—traditions don't just passively decay but
  are actively constructed, contested, and sometimes weaponized. The
  intersection of hermeneutic and critical approaches reveals both tradition's
  epistemic value and its potential for ideological distortion.

  volume = {68},
  pages = {287--306},
  doi = {10.5840/philtoday2024617266},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ambord explores Gadamer's concept of tradition's political
  implications, arguing that his hermeneutics enables both fidelity to
  tradition and critical, emancipatory engagement with it. Gadamer's emphasis
  on tradition's persistence even in social change, combined with recognition
  of interpretation's volitional and risky character, provides resources for
  political philosophy beyond mere conservatism. He traces this through later
  hermeneutic thinkers like Pareyson and Vattimo.

  RELEVANCE: This paper bridges hermeneutic philosophy and political theory,
  showing how Gadamer's account of tradition has implications for
  understanding political and cultural tradition breakdown. The emphasis on
  volition and risk in tradition engagement suggests traditions can change or
  fail based on how communities choose to interpret and carry them forward.
  This connects philosophical hermeneutics to practical questions about
  tradition maintenance and transformation.
