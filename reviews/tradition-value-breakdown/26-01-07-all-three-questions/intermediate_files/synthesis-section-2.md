## Section 1: Conceptual Foundations and the Value Debate

Traditions occupy a central yet curiously undertheorized position in political and cultural philosophy. Before assessing whether traditions can fail or degenerate, we must first establish what traditions are and why they matter. This section examines the conceptual terrain, mapping both conservative defenses of tradition's value and critical perspectives that identify tradition's potential for oppression. The tension between these positions proves productive rather than merely adversarial: the most sophisticated accounts on both sides recognize that traditions simultaneously enable and constrain human agency.

### 1.1 What Is Tradition? Conceptual Analysis

The concept of tradition resists easy definition. David Lewis's influential account of conventions provides a useful starting point, though ultimately proves insufficient. For Lewis (1969), conventions are behavioral regularities sustained by mutual expectations: everyone conforms because everyone expects others to conform, and conformity serves coordination. Conventions thus rest on common knowledge and can arise relatively quickly when coordination problems demand solutions. Yet traditions seem different in kind. A tradition of afternoon tea or constitutional governance involves more than solving coordination problems; it requires temporal extension, transmission across generations, and criteria for authentic continuation that conventions lack.

Martin Beckstein (2017) offers the most systematic recent treatment, arguing that traditions are distinguished by three essential features: patterns of transmission across generations, continuity despite change, and contestable criteria for authentic continuation that practitioners recognize and debate. Unlike conventions, traditions cannot emerge overnight; they require the passing of practices, beliefs, or norms from predecessors to successors. Crucially, living traditions allow for development while maintaining identity. The criteria determining what counts as authentic continuation of a tradition are themselves internal to the tradition and subject to ongoing interpretation and dispute among practitioners.

This emphasis on authentic continuation illuminates an important distinction. Andrei Marmor (2009) differentiates "shallow" conventions from "deep" conventions. Shallow conventions are Lewis-type coordination solutions, while deep conventions constitute practices and generate new reasons for action not reducible to coordination benefits. Language exemplifies a deep convention: linguistic rules are arbitrary yet normatively binding, learned through participation rather than explicit agreement, and constitutive of the very activities they govern. Traditions may be understood as deep conventions with the additional requirement of temporal extension and intergenerational transmission.

Edward Shils (1981) provides an influential sociological typology distinguishing substantive traditions (specific beliefs and practices) from formal traditions (patterns of relationship and modes of transmission). For Shils, traditions gain authority partly from pastness itself: that something has been handed down confers a presumption of value requiring specific reasons to override. Struan Jacobs (2007) identifies four distinct perspectives in Shils's work: pragmatic (traditions as solutions to recurrent problems), Burkean (traditions as accumulated wisdom), veridical (traditions as transmitting truth), and evolutionist (traditions as survival-tested practices). These perspectives are not fully integrated, creating productive tensions that illuminate different dimensions of tradition.

Traditions thus occupy conceptual space between simple conventions and fully institutionalized structures. John Searle's (1995) analysis of institutional facts emphasizes how collective acceptance creates social reality through constitutive rules. Yet Searle's framework focuses on synchronic structure---collective acceptance at a moment in time---while traditions essentially involve diachronic transmission. Neither pure coordination devices like conventions nor formal organizations like governments, traditions represent a distinct mode of social continuity. This conceptual distinctiveness matters for understanding breakdown: different conceptions of what traditions are imply different accounts of how they can fail.

### 1.2 The Conservative Case for Tradition

Conservative philosophy offers sophisticated arguments for tradition's epistemic and practical value. At the core lies what Ferenc Horcher (2020) identifies as three interconnected pillars: prudence, moderation, and tradition itself. Prudence represents practical wisdom in politics---the capacity to judge particular situations rightly without algorithmic rules. Moderation involves avoiding ideological extremes. And tradition provides the accumulated experience within which prudential judgment operates. These pillars support each other: prudent judgment requires familiarity with inherited practices; tradition preserves the lessons of experience; moderation guards against rationalist hubris.

The epistemic argument for tradition holds that inherited practices embody collective wisdom exceeding individual rational capacity. G.K. Chesterton's "fence" principle captures this intuition: before removing a fence whose purpose is unknown, one should understand why it was erected. The fence may serve functions invisible to surface inspection but discoverable through inquiry into its history. Similarly, traditions may encode solutions to problems we no longer consciously recognize, or address perennial human difficulties in ways that appear arbitrary only to those who have forgotten the original challenge. Struan Jacobs and Ian Tregenza (2014) trace this debate through the Popper-Oakeshott correspondence. While Karl Popper advocated critical rationalism and piecemeal social engineering, Michael Oakeshott insisted that political knowledge is tacit and embedded in practices, not fully capturable in explicit rules amenable to rationalist reform. For Oakeshott, tradition embodies practical knowledge that exceeds theoretical articulation.

Alasdair MacIntyre (1984) provides the most influential contemporary philosophical account of tradition-constituted rationality. On his view, what counts as good reason depends on tradition-specific standards of inquiry and evaluation. There is no tradition-independent rational standpoint from which to assess all traditions; rationality itself is exercised within traditions that provide its criteria and procedures. Traditions are not static repositories but dynamic arguments extended across time. A living tradition, as MacIntyre conceives it, is "an historically extended, socially embodied argument"---precisely about what the tradition requires and how its goods should be pursued. Traditions thus encompass not only practices but ongoing debates about those practices.

Marcin Kuna (2005) explicates MacIntyre's response to the charge that tradition-constituted rationality collapses into relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions can be rationally compared when one encounters an epistemological crisis it cannot resolve using its own resources while a rival tradition can both explain the crisis and overcome it. Rationality is tradition-bound but not relativistic because traditions vary in their capacity for self-correction and development. Christopher Stephen Lutz (2004) traces how MacIntyre's engagement with Thomism exemplifies this: Aquinas's synthesis of Aristotelian and Augustinian traditions provides resources for addressing problems neither tradition alone could solve.

Beckstein's (2017) concept of living tradition synthesizes these themes. Living traditions exhibit ongoing internal debate, capacity for creative adaptation while maintaining continuity, authentic continuation versus mere repetition, and active engagement by practitioners who understand themselves as participants rather than passive inheritors. This distinguishes genuine traditions from what David Hollenbach (2019) calls "traditionalism"---the dead faith of the living, rigid adherence to past formulas without creative engagement.

Yet historical revisionism raises troubling questions for conservative defenses. Richard Bourke (2018) and Emily Jones (2017) challenge the standard narrative tracing conservatism to Edmund Burke's opposition to the French Revolution. Bourke argues that Burke was an opposition Whig devoted to reform, not a conservative in the modern sense; the idea of a unified conservative tradition was retrospectively constructed rather than historically continuous. Jones traces how Burke was selectively appropriated in the nineteenth century to create a conservative intellectual tradition. If "conservatism" itself is an invented tradition, this complicates epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom: what authority attaches to wisdom that was retrospectively attributed rather than genuinely transmitted?

### 1.3 Liberal and Critical Perspectives

Against conservative defenses stand formidable critical traditions. The Enlightenment positioned reason as sovereign over traditional authority. Frederick Beiser (1996) traces how early English Enlightenment thinkers developed systematic arguments for reason's sovereignty against inherited belief, establishing rationality as the supreme arbiter of truth and legitimacy. Kant's famous injunction to "dare to know" (sapere aude) captures this stance: traditions represent heteronomy, obstacles to the autonomous use of one's own understanding. Maturity requires thinking for oneself rather than deferring to inherited authority.

The liberal tradition develops this Enlightenment critique in political terms. Jennie Ikuta (2020) explicates John Stuart Mill's argument that custom becomes "social tyranny" constraining individual development. For Mill, conformity to tradition has both external dimensions (social coercion through sanctions) and internal dimensions (self-tyranny through undermined capacity for autonomous judgment). Individuality requires both that conformists cease imposing social penalties on nonconformity and that individuals cultivate their own capacity for judgment against mere custom. The harm principle limits intervention in individual liberty while Mill's perfectionist commitments require conditions enabling autonomous development that mere tradition-following cannot provide.

Yet the Enlightenment critique of tradition faces its own dialectical reversal. Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (2020) argues that instrumental rationality---reason reduced to calculation and domination of nature---becomes a totalizing force perpetuating the very barbarism the Enlightenment sought to overcome. The Enlightenment becomes what it opposed: a new form of mythical thinking, compulsive and unreflective. This does not vindicate tradition against reason but reveals how rationalist critique can itself become oppressive. Andreas Folkers (2015) traces how Michel Foucault develops a genealogical approach to critique that questions the power effects of rationality itself without assuming an external rational standpoint.

Feminist philosophy has subjected traditions to sustained critique as mechanisms of patriarchal oppression. From Mary Wollstonecraft's arguments that traditional gender hierarchies corrupt both men and women by denying women education and rational development (Berges and Coffee 2016), through contemporary analyses of how traditional practices constrain women's agency, feminism identifies traditions as sites of systematic injustice. Yet feminist thought has also generated the most sophisticated attempts to transcend the stark tradition-versus-autonomy dichotomy.

Relational autonomy theories, developed prominently in feminist philosophy, reject both atomistic individualism and uncritical communitarianism. Ji Young Lee (2023) provides a comprehensive overview: relational accounts recognize how social contexts constitute rather than merely constrain agency, while maintaining critical standards for distinguishing social conditions that enhance from those that hinder autonomy. Persons are socially embedded, but not all social embeddings support autonomous agency. Monique Deveaux (2006) examines how this plays out in concrete cases like arranged marriage, showing how liberal critiques often oversimplify traditional practices by ignoring women's agency within cultural contexts and by assuming autonomy requires wholesale rejection of tradition.

Tanya Zion-Waldoks (2014) provides compelling empirical analysis of Israeli Modern-Orthodox women who engage in feminist resistance as religious actors working for religious ends. She conceptualizes their agency as "devoted resistance"---critique within relationship to tradition, enabled by cultural resources and comprising both interpretive skills and relational autonomy capacities. This challenges assumptions that tradition critique requires external standpoints and illuminates how traditions can contain resources for their own reform. Agency operates not only against tradition but within and through it.

Maeve Cooke (2020) examines Jurgen Habermas's attempt to reconcile private autonomy with public democratic autonomy through communicative rationality. Rather than opposing tradition to reason, Habermas seeks to show how legitimate social norms emerge through deliberative processes that transform rather than simply negate inherited practices. Tradition becomes material for communicative reason rather than its enemy, though Cooke identifies unresolved tensions in Habermas's account regarding the relationship between individual freedom and collective self-legislation.

The most productive critical perspectives thus recognize what Horkheimer and Adorno demonstrated: pure anti-traditionalism is self-defeating. Enlightenment critique of tradition can itself become a new form of unreflective domination. Relational autonomy approaches suggest that the question is not whether to defer to tradition or reject it wholesale, but rather how traditions can constitute conditions for genuine autonomy while remaining subject to critical reconstruction when they constrain or oppress. The liberal and critical perspectives identify ways traditions can fail or become defective---by constraining individual development, perpetuating oppression, or blocking autonomous agency---without assuming that tradition as such is the enemy of human flourishing.

This section has established that traditions are distinct from mere conventions in requiring temporal extension, intergenerational transmission, and criteria for authentic continuation. Their value remains genuinely contested between conservative positions emphasizing accumulated wisdom and tradition-constituted rationality, and critical positions emphasizing potential for oppression and heteronomy. The most sophisticated accounts on both sides recognize this tension rather than resolving it one-sidedly. Conservative theories of living tradition acknowledge the need for internal debate and creative adaptation; critical theories of relational autonomy acknowledge that agency operates within as well as against inherited practices. This contested terrain provides the foundation for examining how traditions can break down---the subject to which subsequent sections turn.
