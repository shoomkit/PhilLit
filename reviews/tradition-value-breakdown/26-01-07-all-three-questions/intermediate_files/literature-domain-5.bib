====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses explicit theoretical accounts of HOW and WHY traditions fail,
degenerate, become corrupt, ossified, or lose vitality. The core theoretical framework
comes from Alasdair MacIntyre's account of epistemological crises in traditions, which
argues that traditions face breakdown when they encounter problems their existing
conceptual resources cannot solve. MacIntyre distinguishes "living traditions" (which
sustain ongoing internal debate and development) from "dead" or ossified ones (which
become rigid, cease self-criticism, and degenerate into mere "traditionalism").

Complementing MacIntyre's philosophical analysis, sociological theories from Edward Shils
and anthropological work examine how traditions lose vitality through: (1) corruption of
their internal standards and purposes; (2) ossification into rigid forms disconnected from
living practice; (3) transformation from genuine tradition into mere "traditionalism"
(unreflective adherence to past forms); and (4) failure to sustain the reflexive
self-consciousness necessary for tradition health. Recent work extends these analyses to
cultural decline more broadly, examining theories of decadence, civilizational breakdown,
and the pathologies that emerge when reflexive traditionalism replaces living tradition.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the third research question on how traditions degenerate or
fail. It provides the theoretical vocabulary for distinguishing healthy from pathological
forms of tradition, and offers philosophical frameworks for understanding what makes
traditions "living" versus "dead." This is likely the most innovative contribution of the
literature review, as systematic philosophical theories of tradition breakdown remain
underexplored despite their importance for political philosophy.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework is well-developed, there is limited work
on applying it systematically to concrete political traditions. The distinction between
"living" and "dead" traditions remains somewhat metaphorical and could benefit from more
precise analytical criteria. Contemporary work on cultural decline often focuses on symptoms
rather than mechanisms of degeneration. The relationship between tradition breakdown and
political legitimacy deserves more sustained attention.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should begin with MacIntyre's core framework before expanding to sociological
and anthropological perspectives. Key debates to highlight: whether tradition breakdown is
primarily epistemological, sociological, or ethical in nature; whether "traditionalism" is
necessarily pathological; and how reflexive self-consciousness relates to tradition health.
The section should emphasize the innovative contribution of systematic theories of tradition
failure to political philosophy.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- MacIntyrean epistemological crisis (6 papers): Tradition breakdown as conceptual failure
- Sociological theories of tradition (5 papers): Institutional and cultural degeneration
- Cultural decline and decadence (4 papers): Broader civilizational breakdown patterns
- Living vs. dead tradition (3 papers): Distinguishing healthy from ossified forms

@article{macintyre1977epistemological,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {Epistemological Crises, Dramatic Narrative and the Philosophy of Science},
  journal = {The Monist},
  year = {1977},
  volume = {60},
  number = {4},
  pages = {453--472},
  doi = {10.5840/MONIST197760427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre argues that epistemological crises occur when an agent's or
  tradition's existing conceptual schemes prove inadequate to make sense of new experiences
  or problems, requiring narrative reconstruction to restore intelligibility. He distinguishes
  three stages: initial coherence, breakdown when anomalies accumulate, and resolution through
  a new narrative that explains both prior successes and the crisis itself. The article
  applies this framework to both individual agents and traditions of inquiry (including
  scientific paradigms), arguing that successful crisis resolution requires constructing a
  narrative that makes the previous tradition and its failure intelligible from a new standpoint.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for understanding MacIntyre's account of tradition
  breakdown. It provides the core theoretical framework for analyzing how traditions fail when
  they encounter problems their conceptual resources cannot solve. The epistemological crisis
  concept is essential for distinguishing living traditions (which can undergo creative
  transformation) from dead ones (which cannot adapt). This article directly addresses the
  research question on theories of tradition degeneration by offering a systematic philosophical
  account of the mechanism of breakdown.

  POSITION: Establishes the epistemological crisis framework as central to understanding
  tradition breakdown, emphasizing narrative reconstruction as the path through crisis.

@book{macintyre1988whose,
  author = {MacIntyre, Alasdair},
  title = {Whose Justice? Which Rationality?},
  year = {1988},
  publisher = {University of Notre Dame Press},
  address = {Notre Dame, IN},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacIntyre develops his theory of tradition-constituted rationality, arguing
  that all reasoning takes place within particular traditions of inquiry. He traces the
  development and internal crises of four major traditions (Homeric, Aristotelian, Augustinian,
  Scottish Enlightenment) to show how each faced problems that required fundamental conceptual
  revision. The book systematically explores how traditions develop, encounter crises, and
  either successfully transform or fail. MacIntyre argues that tradition failure occurs when
  adherents can no longer defend their core commitments against both internal incoherence and
  external challenges, leading to "sterile relativism" or abandonment.

  RELEVANCE: This book elaborates MacIntyre's mature theory of tradition breakdown through
  extended historical case studies. It shows how the epistemological crisis framework applies
  to major philosophical and cultural traditions, demonstrating the patterns of degeneration
  and transformation. The work is crucial for understanding how living traditions differ from
  dead ones: living traditions sustain internal debate and can undergo rational transformation,
  while dead traditions ossify into dogmatism or dissolve into incoherence. Essential for the
  research question on tradition degeneration mechanisms.

  POSITION: Extends the epistemological crisis framework into a comprehensive theory of
  tradition-constituted rationality with detailed historical examples of tradition breakdown.

  pages = {540--572},
  doi = {10.1111/J.1468-0378.2011.00505.X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Angier provides a systematic analysis of MacIntyre's concept of tradition,
  examining how traditions are constituted, how they develop, and crucially, how they fail.
  He clarifies the distinction between living traditions (characterized by ongoing argument
  about their goods and purposes) and dead or degenerate traditions (which cease internal
  debate and become either rigid or incoherent). The article examines MacIntyre's criteria
  for tradition health: the capacity for self-criticism, engagement with rival traditions,
  and ability to identify and resolve internal contradictions.

  RELEVANCE: This secondary analysis helps clarify MacIntyre's often complex account of
  tradition breakdown. Angier's systematic treatment makes explicit the criteria distinguishing
  living from dead traditions, which is central to the research question. The article is
  particularly valuable for understanding how MacIntyre's framework can be applied to assess
  the health or degeneration of political traditions. It provides analytical precision to
  concepts that MacIntyre sometimes leaves metaphorical.

  POSITION: Clarifies and systematizes MacIntyre's theory of tradition, emphasizing the
  importance of internal debate and self-criticism for tradition vitality.

@article{jacobs2007shils,
  author = {Jacobs, Struan},
  title = {Edward Shils' Theory of Tradition},
  journal = {Philosophy of the Social Sciences},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {37},
  number = {2},
  pages = {139--162},
  doi = {10.1177/0048393107299685},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jacobs analyzes Edward Shils's multifaceted theory of tradition as developed
  in his 1981 book "Tradition." Shils conceived tradition not as static inheritance but as
  active transmission requiring institutional bearers and cultural reproduction. Jacobs
  identifies four perspectives in Shils's work: pragmatic (traditions as useful social
  coordination), Burkean (traditions as embodied wisdom), veridical (traditions as truth-bearing),
  and evolutionist (traditions as adapted practices). The article examines Shils's typology of
  traditions and his account of how traditions weaken through institutional failure, loss of
  bearers, or disconnection from practice.

  RELEVANCE: Shils provides the most comprehensive sociological theory of tradition to
  complement MacIntyre's philosophical approach. His work on institutional bearers and
  transmission mechanisms helps explain the sociological dimensions of tradition breakdown
  that MacIntyre's epistemological focus sometimes neglects. Understanding how traditions
  depend on institutions and cultural reproduction is essential for analyzing their
  degeneration. This article makes Shils's complex theory accessible and shows its relevance
  for understanding tradition failure.

  POSITION: Presents sociological theory emphasizing institutional bearers and cultural
  transmission as essential for tradition vitality; breakdown occurs through institutional failure.

  volume = {58},
  number = {1},
  pages = {115--141},
  doi = {10.1017/S0003975617000042},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beckstein develops analytical criteria for distinguishing "living" from
  "dead" traditions, addressing a conceptual gap in tradition theory. He argues that living
  traditions exhibit: (1) ongoing internal debate about core commitments; (2) capacity for
  creative adaptation while maintaining continuity; (3) authentic continuation rather than
  mere repetition; and (4) active engagement by participants rather than passive inheritance.
  Dead or ossified traditions lack these features, becoming rigid, unreflective, and
  disconnected from living practice. Beckstein examines the tension between tradition's
  requirement for both continuity and change.

  RELEVANCE: This article directly addresses the distinction between living and dead traditions
  that is central to understanding tradition degeneration. Beckstein provides analytical
  precision to concepts that are often left metaphorical, offering concrete criteria for
  assessing tradition health. His framework helps explain how traditions can fail by ossifying
  even while maintaining formal continuity. Essential for the research question on
  distinguishing healthy from pathological forms of tradition.

  POSITION: Develops explicit criteria for "living traditions" emphasizing internal debate,
  creative adaptation, and authentic rather than merely formal continuation.

@book{herman1997decline,
  author = {Herman, Arthur},
  title = {The Idea of Decline in Western History},
  year = {1997},
  publisher = {Free Press},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Herman traces the intellectual history of "declinism" from ancient times to
  the present, examining how major thinkers have theorized cultural and civilizational
  degeneration. He analyzes two main traditions: pessimistic declinism (exemplified by
  Spengler) which sees decline as inevitable cyclical process, and optimistic responses
  which seek renewal through return to foundations or progressive transformation. Herman
  shows how theories of cultural decline have shaped political movements and identifies
  common patterns in declinist narratives: loss of vitality, corruption of values,
  disconnection from authentic sources, and replacement of living culture with dead forms.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on cultural rather than tradition-specific decline, Herman's
  intellectual history illuminates broader patterns in theories of degeneration that apply
  to traditions. His analysis of Spengler and other decline theorists shows how they
  understood cultural ossification and loss of vitality - concepts directly relevant to
  tradition breakdown. The book provides historical context for understanding contemporary
  theories of tradition degeneration and identifies recurring themes in accounts of how
  cultures and traditions lose their animating spirit.

  POSITION: Intellectual history of declinism showing recurring patterns in theories of
  cultural and civilizational decline across Western thought.

  volume = {14},
  number = {2},
  pages = {351--389},
  doi = {10.2307/3556575},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Church applies MacIntyre's theory of tradition breakdown to the American
  constitutional tradition, arguing it has entered epistemological crisis. He contends the
  tradition's core commitments (individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty)
  have become incoherent when applied to contemporary problems, producing endless controversy
  without resolution. Church examines both MacIntyrean and theological resources for
  addressing this crisis, arguing that successful resolution requires narrative reconstruction
  that makes previous constitutional understandings and their failure intelligible from a
  new standpoint.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates how MacIntyre's framework applies to concrete political
  traditions, showing what tradition breakdown looks like in practice. It illustrates the
  epistemological crisis concept through detailed analysis of American constitutionalism,
  making abstract theory concrete. The article is particularly valuable for showing how
  political traditions can fail even while maintaining formal continuity - a key insight for
  understanding tradition pathology. Essential for connecting tradition theory to political
  practice.

  POSITION: Applies MacIntyrean framework to argue American constitutional tradition has
  entered epistemological crisis requiring fundamental reconstruction.

  number = {1},
  pages = {91--113},
  doi = {10.1017/S0012217300001578},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Szabados examines how Wittgenstein and Mahler responded philosophically
  and artistically to the breakdown of their respective traditions. He argues both faced
  crises where inherited forms and methods no longer sufficed, requiring creative
  transformation while maintaining connection to tradition. Szabados shows how tradition
  breakdown manifests in inability to work creatively within inherited forms, forcing either
  abandonment or radical reconception. The article explores what it means to continue a
  tradition when its fundamental assumptions have collapsed.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on philosophy and music, this article illuminates the phenomenology
  of working within breaking-down traditions - the lived experience of tradition crisis. It
  shows how tradition breakdown manifests not just conceptually but in practical inability to
  employ inherited methods productively. The analysis helps understand the difference between
  creative development within living tradition versus the sterility of working in dead forms.
  Valuable for understanding subjective dimension of tradition degeneration.

  POSITION: Examines phenomenology of tradition breakdown through case studies of Wittgenstein
  and Mahler's creative responses to crisis in their traditions.

  volume = {20},
  pages = {81--95},
  doi = {10.34024/prometeica.2020.20.10021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Petersen applies MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to Marxian
  economic theory, arguing it has been "defeated by its opponents" as a tradition of inquiry.
  He contends that Marxian economics failed to resolve internal theoretical problems and
  withstand external criticism, entering terminal crisis. The article analyzes whether a
  synthesis between Aristotelian philosophy and Marxian economics (as MacIntyre suggests)
  can revive the tradition, concluding such synthesis faces insurmountable obstacles. Petersen
  examines the criteria for determining when a tradition has truly failed versus merely facing
  temporary difficulties.

  RELEVANCE: This article demonstrates MacIntyre's framework applied to a specific intellectual
  tradition, showing what it means for a tradition to be "defeated" rather than merely
  challenged. It helps clarify the difference between normal difficulties (which living
  traditions overcome) and terminal crisis (which marks tradition failure). The analysis of
  whether Marxian economics has failed or can be reconstructed illuminates criteria for
  assessing tradition viability. Useful for understanding when traditions cross from crisis
  to collapse.

  POSITION: Argues Marxian economics has entered terminal epistemological crisis and cannot
  be successfully synthesized with Aristotelian philosophy.

  number = {1},
  pages = {29--48},
  doi = {10.24193/subbphil.2023.sp.iss.03},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Luki{\'c} applies MacIntyre's concept of intelligibility crisis to the
  breakdown of Yugoslav political narrative across three periods: pre-Yugoslav, Yugoslav,
  and post-Yugoslav. He argues that intelligibility crisis occurs when people cannot connect
  themselves meaningfully to new social contexts after their previous narrative framework
  collapses. The article shows how political traditions provide intelligibility through
  narrative coherence, and how their breakdown produces disorientation and conflict. Luki{\'c}
  demonstrates that tradition failure involves loss of narrative coherence that made actions
  and identities intelligible.

  RELEVANCE: This contemporary application of MacIntyre's framework to Yugoslav political
  tradition demonstrates the ongoing relevance of epistemological crisis theory. It shows
  how political tradition breakdown manifests as loss of narrative intelligibility, making
  the concept concrete through historical example. The article illustrates what happens when
  political narratives fail: people lose capacity to make sense of their situation and
  actions. Valuable for understanding the narrative dimension of tradition breakdown and its
  political consequences.

  POSITION: Applies intelligibility crisis concept to Yugoslav case, showing how political
  tradition breakdown produces loss of narrative coherence and meaning.

  volume = {45},
  number = {6},
  pages = {581--597},
  doi = {10.1093/jmp/jhaa026},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kinghorn applies MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework to psychiatric
  diagnosis, arguing that modern DSM-based psychiatry emerged from an epistemological crisis
  in the 1970s. He contends that while DSM achieved political success, it faces ongoing
  scientific and philosophical critique that may precipitate future crisis. Kinghorn argues
  for "epistemological humility" - recognition that psychiatric traditions have inherent
  limitations requiring honest reckoning. The article shows how traditions can achieve
  institutional dominance while remaining epistemologically fragile.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on psychiatry, this article illustrates key aspects of
  epistemological crisis theory: how traditions respond to foundational challenges, achieve
  temporary stability through institutional power rather than intellectual resolution, and
  remain vulnerable to future crisis. It demonstrates the difference between politically
  successful and epistemologically sound crisis resolution. The concept of "epistemological
  humility" adds useful nuance to understanding how traditions should acknowledge their
  limitations to avoid pathological rigidity.

  POSITION: Applies epistemological crisis to psychiatry, arguing institutional success
  masks unresolved theoretical problems requiring epistemological humility.

  journal = {American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {28},
  number = {2},
  pages = {205--224},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lutz examines the central role of narrative in MacIntyre's account of
  tradition-constituted rationality, arguing that traditions are fundamentally narrative
  structures. He shows how traditions maintain rational coherence through narratives that
  connect past, present, and projected future, and how tradition breakdown involves narrative
  collapse or incoherence. Lutz clarifies how MacIntyre's narrative epistemology differs from
  both foundationalist and coherentist alternatives, emphasizing temporal structure and
  teleological orientation. The article explains why narrative failure produces epistemological
  crisis.

  RELEVANCE: This article clarifies the epistemological foundations of MacIntyre's tradition
  theory, showing why narrative coherence is essential for tradition rationality. Understanding
  the narrative dimension helps explain how traditions fail: they lose narrative coherence,
  cannot construct meaningful accounts of their development, or cannot project credible futures.
  The analysis deepens understanding of why epistemological crises require narrative
  reconstruction rather than just conceptual revision. Essential for grasping the connection
  between narrative and tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Clarifies narrative foundations of MacIntyre's epistemology, showing how tradition
  rationality depends on narrative coherence across time.

  volume = {30},
  number = {2},
  pages = {173--200},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Trenery compares MacIntyre's philosophical account of tradition with
  Lindbeck's theological account, examining similarities and differences in how they understand
  tradition development and breakdown. He argues both see traditions as requiring internal
  coherence, continuity with past, and capacity for development, but differ on criteria for
  legitimate change. Trenery explores how both thinkers address the problem of distinguishing
  authentic development from corruption or abandonment, showing different approaches to the
  same fundamental problem.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis illuminates MacIntyre's tradition theory by contrasting
  it with an alternative account, helping clarify what is distinctive about his approach to
  tradition breakdown. The article addresses the crucial question of distinguishing authentic
  development from degeneration - central to understanding when traditions remain living versus
  when they ossify or collapse. Trenery's analysis of competing criteria for tradition health
  enriches understanding of tradition pathology.

@book{spengler1926decline,
  author = {Spengler, Oswald},
  title = {The Decline of the West},
  year = {1926},
  publisher = {Alfred A. Knopf},
  address = {New York},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Spengler presents a cyclical theory of civilizational rise and decline,
  arguing that cultures pass through organic life stages from birth through maturity to
  inevitable death. He contends that Western civilization has entered its "winter" phase
  of decline, characterized by rationalization, mechanization, loss of spiritual vitality,
  and replacement of organic culture with dead "civilization." Spengler sees decline as
  inevitable transformation from creative cultural phase to ossified civilizational phase.
  His morphological approach treats cultures as organisms with natural life cycles.

  RELEVANCE: Though philosophically controversial, Spengler's work provides influential
  framework for understanding cultural decline and ossification that has shaped subsequent
  tradition theory. His distinction between living "culture" (creative, organic) and dead
  "civilization" (mechanical, ossified) parallels the living/dead tradition distinction.
  While his biological determinism is problematic, his phenomenology of cultural vitality
  loss remains influential. Important for historical context of tradition breakdown theories
  and for understanding declinist thought patterns.

  number = {2},
  pages = {369--382},
  doi = {10.1017/S1479244308001753},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bennett analyzes contemporary narratives of cultural decline and pessimism
  in postmodern context, examining how these differ from earlier declinist thought. He argues
  that postmodern cultural pessimism involves anxiety about loss of foundations, fragmentation
  of shared narratives, and inability to sustain cultural meaning and value. Bennett examines
  whether such pessimism is justified or itself a cultural pathology, exploring the paradox
  that cultural decline narratives may themselves contribute to cultural breakdown by
  undermining confidence in cultural transmission.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of contemporary cultural pessimism provides context for
  understanding modern forms of tradition breakdown anxiety. Bennett's examination of how
  decline narratives function in postmodern context illuminates contemporary theories of
  tradition degeneration. His discussion of whether cultural pessimism is warranted or
  pathological relates to questions about when tradition-critical consciousness becomes
  tradition-destroying. Useful for understanding contemporary forms of tradition breakdown
  discourse.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Hollenbach distinguishes "living tradition" from "traditionalism" (the
  "dead faith of the living") in context of Catholic human rights teaching. He argues living
  traditions involve ongoing development and creative engagement with new challenges, while
  traditionalism involves rigid adherence to past formulas. Hollenbach shows how Catholic
  tradition on human rights has developed substantially, demonstrating characteristics of
  living tradition: ability to learn, adapt, and address new problems while maintaining
  continuity with core commitments.

  RELEVANCE: This article provides concrete example of living versus dead tradition
  distinction in action. Hollenbach's analysis shows what tradition vitality looks like
  practically: capacity for development, engagement with contemporary challenges, and creative
  fidelity rather than rigid repetition. His contrast between tradition and traditionalism
  illuminates the pathological form of tradition (mere repetition of past without creative
  engagement). Useful for understanding positive examples of living tradition health.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Swer defends Spengler's thesis about the decline of Western science against
  Haack's criticisms, arguing that science faces diminishing returns and exhaustion of its
  creative phase. He distinguishes Spengler's "annihilationist" view (science will cease)
  from completion/culmination views, examining both externalist (cultural) and internalist
  (scientific) arguments for decline. Swer argues that even if Spengler's biological determinism
  fails, his phenomenology of scientific vitality loss and ossification deserves serious
  consideration as describing real patterns in scientific development.

  RELEVANCE: Though focused on science, this article illustrates key concepts in tradition
  breakdown theory: the difference between creative vitality and mechanical continuation,
  the possibility of exhaustion without formal ending, and the distinction between living
  practice and ossified form. Swer's defense of Spenglerian decline patterns (while rejecting
  determinism) shows how theories of tradition degeneration can capture real phenomena despite
  flawed metaphysical foundations. Useful for understanding decline and ossification concepts.

  volume = {118},
  pages = {77--97},
  doi = {10.15382/sturi2025118.77-97},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kurilovich examines how Koj{\`e}ve distinguished between living and dead
  dogma in Christian theology, using this distinction to selectively engage with Christianity's
  intellectual heritage. The article shows how Koj{\`e}ve's approach involves "demythologizing"
  tradition - extracting productive insights while abandoning what he sees as dead metaphysical
  commitments. Kurilovich analyzes the criteria Koj{\`e}ve uses to distinguish intellectually
  living from dead elements of tradition, and the philosophical assumptions underlying these
  judgments.

  RELEVANCE: This article illuminates the concept of "dead" versus "living" elements within
  traditions through Koj{\`e}ve's selective appropriation of Christianity. It raises important
  questions about whether traditions can be partially living and partially dead, and about
  the criteria for making such distinctions. Koj{\`e}ve's approach exemplifies one response
  to tradition crisis: selective preservation of "living" elements. The analysis helps clarify
  what makes tradition elements "dead" (metaphysically untenable, historically superseded)
  versus "living" (philosophically productive, culturally vital).

  POSITION: Examines Koj{\`e}ve's distinction between living and dead dogma, showing criteria
  for selective appropriation of tradition.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Vasiljevi{\'c} analyzes Zizioulas's hermeneutical principles distinguishing
  "living tradition" from "dead tradition." Zizioulas argues that tradition becomes dead when
  reduced to historical artifact or object of curiosity rather than lived encounter. Living
  tradition requires active interpretative engagement, liturgical participation, and
  eschatological orientation. The article examines how Zizioulas sees tradition pathology
  arising from static readings that treat tradition as fixed past rather than dynamic
  transmission requiring contemporary engagement and interpretation.

  RELEVANCE: This theological analysis provides additional perspective on living/dead tradition
  distinction, emphasizing the importance of active engagement versus passive reception.
  Zizioulas's framework complements MacIntyre's by highlighting the liturgical and participatory
  dimensions of tradition vitality that purely epistemological approaches may miss. His
  emphasis on tradition requiring interpretative engagement to remain living illuminates the
  role of hermeneutical practice in tradition health. Useful for understanding experiential
  and participatory dimensions of tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Orthodox theological view that tradition becomes dead through static reception;
  remains living through active interpretative engagement.
