DOMAIN: Critical and Liberal Perspectives on Tradition
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses critiques of tradition from Enlightenment, liberal,
feminist, and critical theory perspectives. The Enlightenment tradition,
exemplified by Kant's call to "dare to know" (sapere aude), positioned
reason against traditional authority, viewing traditions as potentially
irrational constraints on individual autonomy. Liberal theorists from Mill
to Rawls have grappled with the tension between individual liberty and
traditional social structures, particularly examining how customs and
inherited practices can become instruments of social tyranny. Feminist
philosophers have subjected traditions to sustained critique as mechanisms
of patriarchal oppression, questioning how gendered practices and norms
constrain women's autonomy. Critical theorists, especially the Frankfurt
School, have analyzed how Enlightenment reason itself can become
instrumental and dominating. Recent work has complicated these critiques
through relational conceptions of autonomy that acknowledge how traditions
both constitute and constrain agency.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the normative evaluation of traditions
central to the project. It provides theoretical frameworks for assessing
when traditions become oppressive or irrational, and for understanding the
conditions under which traditions conflict with individual autonomy. These
critiques also establish standards for identifying tradition breakdown or
degeneration.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on feminist and liberal critiques, there is
less philosophical analysis of how traditions can be reformed from within
versus abandoned entirely. The relationship between tradition critique and
tradition preservation remains undertheorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should map the different axes of critique (epistemological,
political, feminist) and examine how they converge or diverge. Special
attention should be paid to how relational autonomy approaches attempt to
bridge the tradition-autonomy divide, and to Habermas's effort to preserve
emancipatory critique while avoiding totalizing instrumental reason.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Enlightenment Critique (Kant, Beiser): 5 papers - Tradition as
  heteronomy vs. rational autonomy
- Liberal Theory (Mill, Rawls): 4 papers - Individual liberty and social
  tyranny of custom
- Feminist Critique (Okin, MacKinnon, relational autonomy): 5 papers -
  Tradition as patriarchal oppression
- Critical Theory (Frankfurt School, Habermas, Foucault): 4 papers -
  Dialectic of Enlightenment and critique of instrumental reason

@book{beiser1996sovereignty,
  author = {Beiser, Frederick C.},
  title = {The Sovereignty of Reason: The Defense of Rationality in the Early English Enlightenment},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  year = {1996},
  doi = {10.1515/9781400864447},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Beiser argues that early English Enlightenment thinkers
  developed a systematic defense of reason's authority against traditional
  religious and political authorities, establishing rationality as the
  supreme arbiter of truth and legitimacy. This involved not merely
  criticizing tradition but constructing positive arguments for reason's
  sovereignty over inherited belief.

  RELEVANCE: This work establishes the foundational Enlightenment
  epistemological critique of tradition as heteronomous authority. It
  provides historical grounding for understanding how the tradition-reason
  opposition became central to modern philosophy, directly informing the
  project's investigation of when traditions are deemed to have failed or
  degenerated by Enlightenment standards.

  POSITION: Represents the classical Enlightenment position that rational
  critique should supersede traditional authority in determining truth and
  political legitimacy.

@book{horkheimer2020dialectic,
  author = {Horkheimer, Max and Adorno, Theodor W.},
  title = {Dialectic of Enlightenment},
  publisher = {Stanford University Press},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1515/9780804788090},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Horkheimer and Adorno argue that Enlightenment reason, in
  its quest to dominate nature and liberate humanity from myth and
  tradition, paradoxically generates new forms of domination and
  reification. Instrumental rationality—reason reduced to mere calculation—
  becomes a totalizing force that perpetuates the very barbarism the
  Enlightenment sought to overcome.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational critical theory text complicates simple
  Enlightenment critiques of tradition by revealing how rational critique
  itself can become oppressive. It is essential for understanding how
  traditions might degenerate not through irrationality but through the
  rationalization process itself, and for analyzing the dialectical
  relationship between tradition, reason, and domination.

  POSITION: Frankfurt School critical theory critique of instrumental
  reason and the internal contradictions of Enlightenment rationality.

@article{folkers2015daring,
  author = {Folkers, Andreas},
  title = {Daring the Truth: Foucault, Parrhesia and the Genealogy of Critique},
  journal = {Theory, Culture \& Society},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {33},
  number = {1},
  pages = {3--28},
  doi = {10.1177/0263276414558885},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Folkers examines Foucault's genealogy of critique from
  ancient parrhesia (truth-telling) through Enlightenment to neoliberal
  critique of the state. Foucault develops an affirmative genealogy showing
  critique not as mere negation but as a complex practice involving truth,
  power, and ethical self-formation. Critical practice questions the power
  effects of rationality itself.

  RELEVANCE: This paper illuminates how Foucault's approach to critique
  differs from both traditional Enlightenment reason and Frankfurt School
  dialectics. It provides tools for analyzing how traditions can be
  critically engaged without assuming a standpoint of pure reason external
  to power relations, crucial for understanding tradition breakdown as
  involving power-knowledge configurations.

  POSITION: Foucauldian genealogical critique that complicates both
  Enlightenment rationalism and Frankfurt School approaches to tradition
  and power.

@article{cooke2020private,
  author = {Cooke, Maeve},
  title = {Private Autonomy and Public Autonomy: Tensions in Habermas's Discourse Theory of Law and Politics},
  journal = {Kantian Review},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {25},
  number = {4},
  pages = {559--582},
  doi = {10.1017/S1369415420000412},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Cooke argues that Habermas's discourse theory attempts to
  reconcile private autonomy (individual freedom from interference) and
  public autonomy (democratic self-legislation) through the co-originality
  thesis, but fails due to an inadequate account of private autonomy. She
  proposes a dialogical conception of autonomy as ethically
  self-determining agency that would better support Habermas's reconciliation
  project.

  RELEVANCE: This paper addresses the central tension between individual
  autonomy and collective tradition/law that runs through liberal and
  critical theory. Habermas's attempt to show these as mutually constitutive
  rather than opposed is crucial for understanding how traditions might be
  both constraining and enabling, and how their breakdown might involve
  failures of this dialectical relationship.

  POSITION: Habermasian discourse theory attempting to mediate between
  liberal individualism and communitarian/traditional authority through
  communicative rationality.

@inbook{deveaux2006personal,
  author = {Deveaux, Monique},
  title = {Personal Autonomy and Cultural Tradition: The Arranged Marriage Debate in Britain},
  booktitle = {Gender and Justice in Multicultural Liberal States},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2006},
  pages = {123--155},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199289790.003.0006},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Deveaux examines the arranged marriage debate to explore
  tensions between liberal commitments to personal autonomy and respect for
  cultural traditions. She argues that liberal critiques often oversimplify
  traditional practices by ignoring women's agency within cultural contexts
  and by assuming autonomy requires rejection of tradition. A more nuanced
  approach recognizes how autonomy can be exercised within traditional
  frameworks.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the autonomy-tradition tension
  central to the project, showing how this plays out in concrete cases. It
  demonstrates how liberal critiques can misidentify tradition breakdown
  and provides frameworks for distinguishing genuinely oppressive traditions
  from those that permit autonomous choice within traditional forms.

  POSITION: Feminist liberal approach that complicates simple
  tradition-autonomy oppositions while maintaining critical perspective on
  oppressive practices.

@article{lee2023relational,
  author = {Lee, Ji Young},
  title = {Relational Approaches to Personal Autonomy},
  journal = {Philosophy Compass},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {18},
  number = {4},
  pages = {e12916},
  doi = {10.1111/phc3.12916},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lee provides a comprehensive overview of relational
  autonomy theories developed by feminists as alternatives to individualistic
  autonomy conceptions. Relational accounts capture how social contexts
  constitute agency while distinguishing between social phenomena that
  enhance versus hinder autonomy. These approaches recognize persons as
  socially embedded while maintaining critical standards for evaluating
  social conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Relational autonomy is crucial for moving beyond the stark
  tradition-versus-autonomy dichotomy. It provides conceptual resources for
  understanding how traditions can constitute the conditions for autonomy
  while also potentially undermining it, essential for analyzing tradition
  breakdown as involving degradation of autonomy-supporting social relations.

  POSITION: Contemporary feminist relational autonomy theory that rejects
  both atomistic individualism and uncritical communitarianism.

@incollection{ikuta2020contesting,
  author = {Ikuta, Jennie C.},
  title = {Contesting Conformity through Individuality in Mill's On Liberty},
  booktitle = {Mill's On Liberty: A Critical Guide},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2020},
  pages = {71--112},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780190087845.003.0003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Ikuta argues that Mill conceived conformity to custom as a
  form of social tyranny with both external (social coercion) and internal
  (self-tyranny through undermined autonomy) dimensions. Individuality is
  Mill's solution requiring both that conformists cease tyrannizing others
  through social penalties and that they cultivate their own capacity for
  autonomous judgment against mere custom.

  RELEVANCE: Mill's account of custom as social tyranny provides a paradigm
  liberal critique of tradition as constraining individual development. This
  is foundational for understanding liberal standards by which traditions
  are judged to have failed or become oppressive, and for analyzing how
  tradition breakdown might involve loss of individuality versus conformism.

  POSITION: Classical liberal critique of custom and tradition as obstacles
  to individual autonomy and development.

@article{zionwaldoks2014politics,
  author = {Zion-Waldoks, Tanya},
  title = {Politics of Devoted Resistance: Agency, Feminism, and Religion},
  journal = {Gender \& Society},
  year = {2014},
  volume = {29},
  number = {5},
  pages = {660--684},
  doi = {10.1177/0891243214549353},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Zion-Waldoks analyzes Israeli Modern-Orthodox women
  activists who engage in feminist resistance as religious actors working
  for religious ends. She conceptualizes their agency as "devoted
  resistance"—critique within relationship to tradition, enabled by cultural
  schema and comprising both interpretive skills and relational-autonomy
  capacities. This challenges dichotomies like feminism/religion and
  resistance/submission.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical case demonstrates how agency and critique can
  operate within rather than against traditional frameworks. It challenges
  assumptions that tradition critique requires external standpoints and
  illuminates how traditions can contain resources for their own reform,
  relevant to understanding how traditions might regenerate versus degenerate.

  POSITION: Empirically-grounded relational autonomy approach showing
  feminist agency within religious tradition.

@article{gutmann2022liberalism,
  author = {Gutmann, Thomas},
  title = {Liberalism and (How to Avoid) Paternalism},
  journal = {Zeitschrift für Ethik und Moralphilosophie},
  year = {2022},
  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  pages = {147--155},
  doi = {10.1007/s42048-022-00126-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gutmann sketches the anti-paternalist liberal tradition
  from Kant to Dworkin centered on normative individualism and protecting
  conditions of autonomy as individual rights. He distinguishes "personal
  autonomy" (perfectionist ideals of autonomous persons) from "autonomy as
  a right" (Feinberg), showing the liberal tradition focuses on rights
  rather than perfectionist ideals, though both involve protecting agency.

  RELEVANCE: This clarifies the conceptual foundations of liberal autonomy
  and its opposition to paternalistic authority, including traditional
  authority. The distinction between autonomy as ideal versus autonomy as
  right is important for understanding different ways traditions might
  conflict with or support autonomy, and different standards for judging
  tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Contemporary liberal theory defending anti-paternalism while
  clarifying different conceptions of autonomy.

  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198766841.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This volume recovers Wollstonecraft's contributions to
  moral and political philosophy, including her republican approach to
  gender and her critique of traditional gender roles as obstacles to virtue
  and rational autonomy. Wollstonecraft argued that traditional gender
  hierarchies corrupt both men and women by denying women education and
  rational development.

  RELEVANCE: Wollstonecraft represents an early feminist Enlightenment
  critique of tradition as perpetuating gender oppression and irrationality.
  Her work is foundational for understanding feminist critiques of tradition
  and provides historical depth to contemporary debates about tradition,
  gender, and autonomy central to the project.

  POSITION: Early feminist republican critique of traditional gender roles

  title = {Meeting Halfway between Rochester and Frankfurt: Generative Salience, Focal Points, and Strategic Interaction},
  journal = {American Journal of Political Science},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {44},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--16},
  doi = {10.2307/2669289},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schiemann argues that rational choice theory and
  Habermasian critical theory exclude important intersubjective categories
  from analyses of strategic interaction. Successful coordination often
  depends on irreducibly intersubjective "lifeworld" categories that cannot
  be reduced to instrumental rationality. Together, these traditions provide
  better understanding than either alone.

  RELEVANCE: This paper demonstrates how traditions (as lifeworld
  background) enable rather than merely constrain rational action. It
  suggests tradition breakdown might involve loss of shared intersubjective
  frameworks necessary for coordination, challenging simple opposition
  between tradition and rationality.

  POSITION: Attempt to synthesize rational choice and critical theory by
  showing complementary roles of instrumental and communicative rationality.

@article{heller2025dialectic,

  title = {The Dialectic of Utility: Reconsidering Enlightenment in Hegel and Horkheimer/Adorno},
  journal = {Hegel Bulletin},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {46},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--22},
  doi = {10.1017/hgl.2025.16},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Heller argues that Hegel's concept of utility in the
  Phenomenology cannot be reduced to instrumentalization as Adorno and
  Horkheimer suggest. For Hegel, utility describes mutual support in a
  collective that respects heterogeneity. A post-Hegelian utility concept
  establishes constitutive relations between self-care and usefulness to
  others, contributing to affirmative Enlightenment rather than domination.

  RELEVANCE: This reconceptualization of Enlightenment utility challenges
  the Frankfurt School's pessimistic reading and suggests how Enlightenment
  critique of tradition need not culminate in pure instrumentalization. It
  provides resources for understanding non-dominating relationships between
  reason and social practice relevant to tradition analysis.

  POSITION: Post-Hegelian reconstruction of Enlightenment rationality
  against Frankfurt School pessimism.

  number = {1},
  pages = {3--22},
  doi = {10.1177/01914537241284718},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Kent argues against pessimistic readings of Dialectic of
  Enlightenment by showing that for Horkheimer and Adorno, myth's linguistic
  mediation offers potential for enlightenment. Myth can illuminate
  contingent historical factors that led to domination while reflecting
  alternative human possibilities, presenting renewed chances for liberation
  through critical engagement with tradition.

  RELEVANCE: This reading suggests tradition (as myth) is not merely
  heteronomous domination but contains fragmentary resources for critique
  and alternative possibilities. It challenges stark tradition-versus-reason
  dichotomies and suggests tradition breakdown might involve loss of access
  to historical experience rather than pure liberation.

  POSITION: Reconstructive reading of Frankfurt School showing myth/tradition
  as ambivalent rather than purely dominating.

  number = {595},
  pages = {1959--1993},
  doi = {10.1111/ecoj.12298},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lombardi et al. analyze Mill's Weak Harm Principle in
  welfare economics, showing that liberal non-interfering approaches can
  provide consistent foundations for social welfare judgments and establish
  connections between liberal autonomy principles and Rawlsian egalitarianism.
  Liberal autonomy commitments generate egalitarian distributive implications.

  RELEVANCE: This formal analysis demonstrates how Mill's liberal principle
  limiting interference with individual autonomy connects to egalitarian
  justice principles. It shows how liberal critiques of traditional authority
  generate specific normative standards for social arrangements, relevant to
  evaluating when traditions become unjust or fail.

  POSITION: Formal analysis showing connections between Millian liberalism

  volume = {2},
  number = {2},
  pages = {53--66},
  doi = {10.32591/coas.ojsp.0202.03053m},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Merawi examines Habermas's critique that Horkheimer and
  Adorno trap reason in instrumental rationality, offering no emancipatory
  alternative. Habermas's communicative rationality provides an emancipatory
  model distinguishing instrumental from communicative reason. However,
  Habermas insufficiently attends to aesthetic truth and non-discursive
  forms of critique.

  RELEVANCE: This clarifies the evolution from first to second generation
  Frankfurt School and different conceptions of how critique can be
  emancipatory. Understanding these debates is crucial for the project's
  analysis of how traditions are evaluated and what standards (instrumental,
  communicative, aesthetic) apply to identifying tradition breakdown.

  POSITION: Second generation Frankfurt School (Habermas) versus first
  generation on critique and emancipation.

  volume = {37},
  number = {3},
  pages = {335--364},
  doi = {10.1057/palgrave.polity.2300019},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Schoolman argues that Dialectic of Enlightenment deploys
  aesthetic reason as a form of aporetic critique that avoids the
  "embarrassment" of claiming a privileged rational standpoint while
  criticizing instrumental reason. Aesthetic experience provides access to
  non-dominating forms of rationality and preserves critical capacity
  without transcendental foundations.

  RELEVANCE: This interpretation illuminates how critical theory can critique
  tradition and instrumental reason without assuming an external rational
  standpoint. It suggests aesthetic dimensions of tradition might resist
  reduction to instrumental utility, relevant to understanding multi-
  dimensional tradition breakdown beyond purely rational critique.

  POSITION: Frankfurt School aesthetic-critical approach as alternative to
  instrumental and communicative rationality.

  pages = {169--179},
  doi = {10.21146/2072-0726-2024-17-1-169-179},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Smirnov traces two traditions of freedom—negative freedom
  (liberal) and autonomy (republican)—showing how republican critique
  reveals limitations in liberal freedom that fails to account for
  interference possibilities and internalized oppression. However, autonomy
  conceptions also have limitations regarding externally imposed values and
  their internalization.

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of competing freedom conceptions illuminates
  different ways traditions might constrain freedom—through direct
  interference (liberal concern) or through internalization of oppressive
  values (republican/autonomy concern). Both are relevant to understanding
  how traditions become oppressive and when they might be judged to have
  failed.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Davy argues that dominant moral and political theories
  centered on individual autonomy systematically exclude persons with
  intellectual disabilities. She advocates "philosophical inclusive design"
  that reconstructs autonomy and agency to include diverse forms of
  dependence and interdependence, challenging liberal individualism's limits.

  RELEVANCE: This critique of autonomy-centered philosophy reveals how
  liberal and feminist critiques of tradition may themselves exclude some
  forms of human flourishing. It complicates the project's understanding of
  autonomy as the standard against which traditions are judged, suggesting
  more inclusive conceptions are needed.

  doi = {10.33392/diam.1991},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Metz argues that strong intuitions about just healthcare
  allocation are incompatible with autonomy-centric and neutral strains of
  liberal political theory. Healthcare decisions routinely make judgments
  about good lives that liberalism claims the state should avoid, creating
  unresolved tension between liberal principles and healthcare justice
  intuitions.

  RELEVANCE: This reveals internal tensions in liberal theory's autonomy
  commitments and neutrality principles that inform liberal critiques of
  tradition. If liberal theory itself cannot maintain strict neutrality and
  autonomy principles, this affects how confidently it can critique
  traditional authority on those grounds, relevant to evaluating tradition
  breakdown claims.
