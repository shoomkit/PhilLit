====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers philosophical arguments defending the value and authority
of tradition from a conservative perspective. The central debate concerns
whether traditions embody accumulated wisdom that transcends individual
reason, and how traditions ground practical reason and moral judgment.

Key figures include Edmund Burke (founder of modern conservatism), Michael
Oakeshott (critic of rationalism in politics), Alasdair MacIntyre (virtue
ethics and tradition-constituted rationality), and contemporary thinkers
like Roger Scruton and Ferenc Horcher. The domain encompasses both
epistemological arguments (tradition as wisdom) and identity-based arguments
(tradition as constitutive of self and community).

Major positions include: (1) Burkean skepticism of abstract rationalism
favoring inherited wisdom, (2) Oakeshott's critique of "rationalism in
politics" emphasizing tacit practical knowledge, (3) MacIntyre's
neo-Aristotelian account of practices and narrative identity embedded in
traditions, (4) communitarian defenses emphasizing tradition's role in
constituting identity.

Recent work examines tensions between conservative and liberal traditions,
the epistemic status of tradition, and whether conservative philosophy
constitutes a coherent doctrine or merely a dispositional stance.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses arguments FOR tradition, providing the
counter-position to critical and reformist views. Understanding conservative
defenses is essential for analyzing when and why traditions fail, as
conservatives emphasize tradition's resilience and adaptive capacity.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited engagement with empirical studies of tradition breakdown. Few
papers address the conservative response to tradition degeneration. More
work needed on epistemic arguments (Chesterton's fence) beyond MacIntyre.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare epistemic (tradition as accumulated wisdom) versus identity-based
(tradition as constitutive) arguments. Note tensions between different
conservative traditions. Examine what conservatives say about tradition
failure or corruption.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Burkean traditionalism: 7 papers - Skepticism of abstract reason, emphasis on inherited wisdom
- Oakeshott's anti-rationalism: 5 papers - Critique of technical knowledge in politics
- MacIntyrean virtue ethics: 4 papers - Tradition-constituted rationality, narrative unity
- Communitarian defenses: 2 papers - Traditions constitute identity and community

@article{bourke2018conservatism,
  author = {Bourke, Richard},
  title = {What is conservatism? History, ideology and party},
  journal = {European Journal of Political Theory},
  year = {2018},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {449--475},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885118782384},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Bourke challenges the standard narrative that traces conservatism to Burke's opposition to the French Revolution, arguing that the idea of a unified conservative tradition is a belated construction rather than a historical reality. Burke was an opposition Whig devoted to reform, not a conservative in the modern sense. The notion of a "conservative philosophy" is fundamentally misconceived.

  RELEVANCE: This revisionist history is crucial for the project because it questions whether there IS a coherent conservative tradition defending tradition. If Bourke is right, conservative defenses of tradition may be more fragmented and context-dependent than typically assumed. This bears directly on understanding how traditions fail: if conservatism itself lacks continuity, it undermines epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom.

  POSITION: Represents skepticism about conservative ideology as a transhistorical doctrine, challenging the coherence of the conservative intellectual tradition itself.

@book{horcher2020conservatism,
  author = {H{\"o}rcher, Ferenc},
  title = {A Political Philosophy of Conservatism: Prudence, Moderation and Tradition},
  publisher = {Bloomsbury Academic},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.5040/9781350067219},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: H{\"o}rcher provides a systematic contemporary defense of conservative political philosophy centered on three pillars: prudence (practical wisdom in politics), moderation (avoiding extremes), and tradition (as source of wisdom and continuity). He argues that conservatism is not mere resistance to change but a thoughtful approach to maintaining what works while adapting gradually. Tradition provides epistemic advantages through accumulated experience.

  RELEVANCE: This recent systematic treatment connects classical conservative themes (Burke, Oakeshott) to contemporary political philosophy. H{\"o}rcher's emphasis on tradition as epistemically valuable (not just identity-constituting) relates directly to the project's concern with when traditions lose their value. His account of prudence suggests traditions degenerate when prudential judgment is abandoned for ideological certainty.

  POSITION: Contemporary neo-conservative synthesis emphasizing tradition as source of practical political wisdom.

  year = {2014},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {3--24},
  doi = {10.1177/1474885112471274},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the 1948 correspondence between Karl Popper and Michael Oakeshott regarding rationalism and tradition. While both criticized utopianism, they differed fundamentally: Popper advocated critical rationalism and piecemeal social engineering, while Oakeshott defended tradition as embodying practical knowledge resistant to rationalist reform. The exchange reveals deep tensions between liberal rationalism and conservative traditionalism.

  RELEVANCE: This exchange illuminates the core epistemic dispute about tradition. Popper's position that tradition must justify itself through critical scrutiny contrasts with Oakeshott's view that traditions embody tacit knowledge beyond explicit justification. This bears on tradition breakdown: Oakeshott would see degeneration as loss of tacit knowledge, Popper as failure to adapt through criticism.

  POSITION: Presents the debate between critical rationalism and conservative traditionalism, showing fundamental disagreement about tradition's epistemic status.

@article{kuna2005macintyre,
  author = {Kuna, Marcin},
  title = {MacIntyre on Tradition, Rationality, and Relativism},
  journal = {Res Publica},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {251--273},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-005-0558-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes MacIntyre's response to the charge that tradition-based rationality leads to relativism. MacIntyre argues that traditions can be rationally compared when one tradition encounters an epistemological crisis it cannot resolve using its own resources, while a rival tradition can explain and resolve that crisis. Rationality is tradition-constituted but not relativistic because traditions can be shown superior through their capacity to overcome intellectual crises.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's account of epistemological crisis within traditions is directly relevant to understanding tradition breakdown. Traditions degenerate when they lose the capacity for self-correction and encounter crises they cannot resolve. This provides a non-relativist framework for judging tradition failure that conservatives could accept.

  POSITION: MacIntyrean neo-Aristotelian defense of tradition-constituted rationality against relativism, emphasizing traditions' capacity for self-critique and development.

@article{beckstein2017living,
  author = {Beckstein, Martin},
  title = {The concept of a living tradition},
  journal = {European Journal of Social Theory},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {20},
  pages = {491--510},
  doi = {10.1177/1368431016668185},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a philosophical account of what makes a tradition "living" versus dead or ossified. Living traditions balance continuity with change: they maintain core commitments while adapting to new circumstances through interpretive development. This requires practitioners who actively engage tradition critically rather than merely repeating inherited forms. Drawing on MacIntyre and Gadamer, Beckstein argues living traditions involve ongoing dialogue between past and present.

  RELEVANCE: This concept of "living tradition" is central to understanding tradition degeneration. Traditions die when they become rigid and incapable of interpretation and adaptation, or when they lose practitioners capable of engaging them thoughtfully. This provides criteria for distinguishing healthy from degenerating traditions beyond conservative apologetics.

  POSITION: Hermeneutical-conservative synthesis emphasizing tradition's dynamic character and requirements for vitality.

@book{jones2017burke,
  author = {Jones, Emily},
  title = {Edmund Burke and the Invention of Modern Conservatism, 1830--1914: An Intellectual History},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198799429.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Jones traces how Edmund Burke was retrospectively constructed as the "father of conservatism" in the nineteenth century. Burke's thought was selectively appropriated and transformed by later thinkers to create a conservative intellectual tradition. This invention process reveals that conservatism is less a stable philosophy than a politically useful narrative about continuity with the past.

  RELEVANCE: Like Bourke's work, this challenges the idea of a coherent conservative tradition defending tradition. If conservatism itself is an invented tradition, this undermines epistemic arguments from accumulated wisdom and raises questions about conservative authority to pronounce on tradition's value. The "invention" of conservatism may itself exemplify tradition degeneration through distortion.

  POSITION: Historical revisionism questioning the coherence and continuity of the conservative tradition, showing it as constructed narrative.

@book{lutz2004tradition,
  author = {Lutz, Christopher Stephen},
  title = {Tradition in the Ethics of Alasdair MacIntyre: Relativism, Thomism, and Philosophy},
  publisher = {Lexington Books},
  year = {2004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides comprehensive examination of MacIntyre's concept of tradition across his career, from After Virtue through Whose Justice? Which Rationality? and beyond. Lutz explicates MacIntyre's claim that all rationality is tradition-constituted, analyzing how MacIntyre's turn to Thomism represents engagement with a specific tradition. The book addresses challenges that MacIntyre's position faces incoherence or slides into relativism.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's framework is one of the most sophisticated contemporary defenses of tradition in philosophy. His account of how traditions develop through encountering and resolving epistemological crises provides resources for understanding both tradition vitality and degeneration. The book's analysis of MacIntyre's Thomism shows how he thinks traditions can be ranked, relevant to normative assessments of tradition value.

  POSITION: Comprehensive treatment of MacIntyrean virtue ethics and tradition-constituted rationality, addressing relativism objections.

  year = {1991},
  volume = {51},
  pages = {611--617},
  doi = {10.2307/2107880},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the relationship between linguistic competence and MacIntyre's notion of tradition-constituted rationality. Argues that MacIntyre's account of tradition is grounded in Wittgensteinian insights about language as social practice. Just as linguistic meaning requires participation in language games embedded in forms of life, rationality requires participation in tradition-constituted practices. Competence in both cases is acquired through training and socialization, not derivable from explicit rules.

  RELEVANCE: This linguistic analysis illuminates how traditions function and what their breakdown might involve. If rationality is like linguistic competence—requiring immersion in practices—then tradition degeneration might be like language death: loss of fluent practitioners who can navigate the tradition skillfully. This provides an account of what's lost when traditions fail.

  POSITION: Wittgensteinian interpretation of MacIntyre connecting tradition to language-game theory and social practices.

@article{alexander2012tradition,
  author = {Alexander, James},
  title = {Three Rival Views of Tradition (Arendt, Oakeshott and MacIntyre)},
  year = {2012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares three major twentieth-century philosophical accounts of tradition: Hannah Arendt (tradition as broken), Michael Oakeshott (tradition as continuously operative), and Alasdair MacIntyre (tradition as something that should condition action). Each differs in their assessment of modernity's relationship to tradition. Arendt sees tradition as severed and irretrievable, Oakeshott sees it as inevitably present in all human activity, MacIntyre sees it as endangered but recoverable through conscious adherence.

  RELEVANCE: This comparative analysis reveals fundamentally different diagnoses of tradition's status in modernity. The contrast between Oakeshott (tradition always operates) and Arendt (tradition is broken) bears directly on whether tradition degeneration is possible or what form it takes. MacIntyre's intermediate position suggests traditions can fail but be revived through deliberate cultivation.

  POSITION: Comparative analysis showing three distinct views on tradition's possibility, presence, and normativity in modern life.

  year = {2013},
  pages = {37--67},
  doi = {10.1057/9781137291622_2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between reason and tradition in political philosophy, focusing on how tradition can serve as a source of rational authority rather than mere prejudice. Analyzes arguments that tradition embodies collective learning and problem-solving over time, making it epistemically superior to individual reason in many contexts. Discusses tensions between traditional authority and critical rationality.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the epistemic argument for tradition directly, examining whether traditions provide genuine knowledge or merely inherited prejudice. The answer bears on what's lost when traditions degenerate: if traditions embody accumulated wisdom, their loss represents genuine epistemic damage. The chapter likely engages with both conservative defenses (tradition as wisdom) and liberal critiques (tradition as obstacle to progress).

@article{horcher2021platonist,
  author = {H{\"o}rcher, Ferenc},
  title = {Platonist, Aristotelian or simply Classical? Roger Scruton's Political Philosophy and the Great Tradition},
  journal = {Politics},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.4000/151ii},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes Roger Scruton's political philosophy as drawing on classical sources, particularly Plato and Aristotle, while avoiding rigid adherence to either. Scruton synthesizes Platonic emphasis on transcendent values and beauty with Aristotelian emphasis on practices, virtues, and human flourishing. His conservatism sees politics as essential to human life (thick conception) rather than merely instrumental, and emphasizes civic participation as part of flourishing.

  RELEVANCE: Scruton represents contemporary conservative philosophy that grounds tradition in classical philosophical arguments about human nature and the good life. His synthesis of Platonic and Aristotelian themes shows how conservative traditionalism connects to virtue ethics and perfectionism. This bears on tradition value: if traditions embody goods essential to flourishing, their breakdown damages human well-being directly.

  volume = {60},
  pages = {381--398},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1467-9248.2011.00917.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Contrasts J{\"u}rgen Habermas's procedural rationalism with Michael Oakeshott's traditionalist critique of rationalism. While Habermas seeks universal rational foundations for morality through ideal discourse, Oakeshott insists moral and political knowledge is embedded in inherited practices and traditions that cannot be reduced to explicit principles. The paper explores implications of this disagreement for democratic theory.

  RELEVANCE: This debate between Habermasian rationalism and Oakeshottian traditionalism is central to understanding arguments about tradition's value. It reveals a fundamental divide: whether moral knowledge requires explicit rational justification (Habermas) or is carried in practices resistant to full articulation (Oakeshott). This affects how we understand tradition degeneration—as loss of explicit principles or tacit knowledge.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.18523/2617-1678.2022.9-10.107-118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Creates dialogue between John Rawls and Michael Oakeshott on rationalism, tradition, and relativism. Argues that while Rawls appears to offer rationalist foundations for justice, his method of reflective equilibrium and appeal to ideas "implicit in public culture" actually makes him closer to Oakeshott's traditionalism than commonly recognized. Both root political principles in existing traditions and practices rather than pure reason, though they differ on which tradition and how explicitly.

  RELEVANCE: This convergence thesis suggests that even liberal political philosophy may require appeal to tradition, undermining sharp dichotomies between rationalism and traditionalism. It complicates the project's framework: if liberals like Rawls also rely on tradition (American constitutional tradition), then tradition breakdown affects liberal and conservative projects alike. The question becomes which traditions and how they're invoked.

@book{sandel1982liberalism,
  author = {Sandel, Michael J.},
  title = {Liberalism and the Limits of Justice},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  year = {1982},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sandel challenges Rawlsian liberalism's conception of the self as prior to and independent of its ends. He argues that individuals are constituted by communal attachments and traditions that shape their identity, not merely bearers of rights choosing among life plans. Justice requires recognizing how community and tradition constitute the self, not just distributing goods fairly among atomistic individuals. This communitarian critique emphasizes tradition's identity-constituting role.

  RELEVANCE: Sandel's communitarianism provides the identity-based argument for tradition's value, complementing epistemic arguments. If traditions constitute our identities, their breakdown represents loss of self-understanding and coherent identity. This bears on the project: tradition degeneration may involve not just loss of knowledge but dissolution of the communities and identities traditions sustain.

  POSITION: Communitarian critique of liberal individualism, emphasizing tradition and community as constitutive of identity and prerequisite for meaningful choice.

@article{trenery2014macintyre,
  author = {Trenery, David},
  title = {Alasdair MacIntyre, George Lindbeck, and the Nature of Tradition},
  year = {2014},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compares MacIntyre's philosophical account of tradition with theologian George Lindbeck's cultural-linguistic approach to religious traditions. Both emphasize how traditions function as interpretive frameworks that shape practitioners' experience and reasoning. Lindbeck's focus on tradition as communal language game complements MacIntyre's emphasis on practices and narrative. Together they show traditions as comprehensive frameworks, not mere collections of beliefs.

  RELEVANCE: This comparison illuminates tradition's comprehensive nature: not just discrete beliefs or practices but whole frameworks for interpreting experience. This bears on tradition breakdown: degeneration involves loss of the interpretive framework itself, not just specific elements. When traditions fail, practitioners lose the conceptual resources to make sense of their experience within that tradition.

  POSITION: Synthetic account of tradition drawing on MacIntyre and Lindbeck, emphasizing tradition as comprehensive cultural-linguistic framework.

  volume = {17},
  pages = {144--157},
  doi = {10.17323/1728-192X-2018-4-144-157},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Hannah Arendt's analysis of tradition's collapse to critique contemporary radical conservatism. Arendt argued that genuine tradition was broken by modernity's revolutions, and attempts to restore it artificially result in pseudo-tradition serving nihilistic ends. Contemporary radical conservatism often legitimizes itself through appeals to crisis of tradition while actually embodying anti-traditional attitudes. Distinguishes genuine conservatism (preserving living tradition) from pseudo-conservatism (instrumentalizing tradition for power).

  RELEVANCE: This analysis of pseudo-tradition is crucial for understanding tradition degeneration. Traditions can fail not only by dying out but by being corrupted into simulacra serving ideological purposes. The distinction between genuine and pseudo-conservatism suggests criteria for judging tradition authenticity: does it preserve living practices or merely invoke "tradition" rhetorically?

  journal = {Kultura},

  doi = {10.5937/kultura2589105j},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between tradition and conservatism through their stances on continuity, change, and freedom. Distinguishes Anglo-American conservatism (emphasizing individual liberty and limited government) from European conservatism (emphasizing social hierarchy and organic community). Argues both view tradition as providing continuity but differ on accommodation of change and conception of freedom. Traditionalism (rigid adherence) differs from conservatism (thoughtful preservation).

  RELEVANCE: This distinction between tradition, traditionalism, and different conservative schools clarifies debates about tradition's value. It suggests traditions can degenerate either through ossification (becoming mere traditionalism) or through unthinking change (losing continuity). The paper's attention to different conservative traditions bears on the project: conservatism itself is internally plural, with varying accounts of tradition's role.

  volume = {34},
  pages = {158--170},
  doi = {10.1177/0953946820984077},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes MacIntyre's late concept of "sociological self-knowledge" from Ethics in the Conflicts of Modernity (2016). MacIntyre argues that moral traditions must develop understanding of the social structures in which they operate, not just abstract moral principles. This requires critical realist sociology to grasp how institutions shape moral possibilities. Christian ethics needs both tradition-based virtues and sociological understanding of contemporary institutions to address practical moral questions.

  RELEVANCE: MacIntyre's emphasis on sociological self-knowledge for tradition vitality is directly relevant to understanding tradition breakdown. Traditions may degenerate when they lose capacity to understand their social context and how institutions enable or obstruct their practices. This suggests tradition failure involves not just internal corruption but inability to navigate changing social structures intelligently.
