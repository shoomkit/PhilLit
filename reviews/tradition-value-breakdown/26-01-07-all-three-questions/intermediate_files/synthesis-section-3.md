## Section 2: Theories of Tradition Breakdown and Degeneration

Understanding what makes traditions valuable requires grasping how they can fail. While the previous section examined competing accounts of tradition's normative status, this section turns to the more neglected question of tradition pathology: the mechanisms by which traditions degenerate, ossify, or collapse entirely. This represents perhaps the review's most innovative contribution, synthesizing disparate literatures into a systematic account of tradition breakdown. The analysis reveals that tradition failure has multiple interconnected dimensions—epistemological, institutional, hermeneutic, and political—each illuminating different vulnerabilities that traditions face.

### 2.1 MacIntyre's Epistemological Crisis Framework

The most systematic philosophical framework for understanding tradition breakdown comes from Alasdair MacIntyre's account of epistemological crises. MacIntyre (1977) argues that traditions of inquiry face fundamental challenges when their existing conceptual resources prove inadequate to solve problems or make sense of new experiences. Such crises unfold through three stages: an initial period of coherence where the tradition's core commitments enable productive inquiry; a breakdown phase when anomalies accumulate faster than the tradition can absorb them; and finally, either resolution through narrative reconstruction or terminal collapse.

The epistemological crisis concept draws on but extends Thomas Kuhn's account of scientific revolutions. Where Kuhn focused primarily on paradigm shifts within scientific communities, MacIntyre (1988) generalizes the framework to encompass moral, political, and cultural traditions. In *Whose Justice? Which Rationality?*, he traces four major intellectual traditions—Homeric, Aristotelian, Augustinian, and Scottish Enlightenment—demonstrating how each faced moments of crisis requiring fundamental reconceptualization. The crucial insight is that traditions can be rationally evaluated precisely through such crises: a tradition demonstrates its vitality by constructing narratives that explain both its prior success and the nature of the crisis itself.

Kuna (2005) addresses the relativist challenge this framework seems to invite. If reasoning occurs within traditions, how can we compare them? MacIntyre's response, Kuna argues, is that traditions can be rationally compared when one proves capable of resolving crises that another cannot. A tradition that successfully navigates epistemological crisis while a rival tradition stagnates has demonstrated rational superiority—not from a tradition-neutral standpoint (which MacIntyre denies exists), but through its superior problem-solving capacity. This matters for understanding breakdown: traditions fail not merely because they encounter difficulties, but because they cannot develop the conceptual resources needed to overcome them.

Angier (2014) systematizes MacIntyre's often-scattered remarks on tradition, clarifying the criteria that distinguish living traditions from dead or degenerate ones. Living traditions sustain ongoing internal argument about what the tradition requires; they engage seriously with rival traditions; they can identify and address their own internal contradictions. Dead traditions, by contrast, ossify into dogmatism—unable to absorb criticism or acknowledge failures—or dissolve into incoherence when adherents abandon core commitments without constructing adequate replacements. The distinction is not merely descriptive but normative: traditions have an obligation to maintain the conditions for their own health.

Lutz (2019) deepens the analysis by emphasizing the narrative dimension of tradition-constituted rationality. Traditions are not simply collections of beliefs or practices but fundamentally narrative structures connecting past, present, and projected future. Epistemological crisis involves narrative collapse: the tradition can no longer tell a coherent story about itself, cannot explain how it arrived at its current predicament, cannot articulate a credible path forward. Resolution requires constructing a new narrative that makes the previous understanding and its failure intelligible. This explains why tradition breakdown is so disorienting—it threatens not just particular beliefs but the intelligibility of one's situation within an ongoing story.

### 2.2 Institutional and Sociological Dimensions

MacIntyre's epistemological focus, while philosophically sophisticated, requires supplementation with attention to the institutional and sociological conditions that traditions depend upon. Edward Shils's (1981) comprehensive treatment emphasizes that traditions are not self-sustaining conceptual structures but require institutional bearers and cultural reproduction mechanisms. Breakdown can occur not only through conceptual failure but through the collapse of the institutions that transmit tradition across generations.

Jacobs (2007) identifies four distinct perspectives operating within Shils's work, each implying different criteria for tradition failure. The *pragmatic* perspective views traditions as useful social coordination mechanisms; they fail when they no longer solve practical problems. The *Burkean* perspective sees traditions as embodying accumulated wisdom; they fail when connection to this wisdom severs. The *veridical* perspective treats traditions as potentially truth-bearing; they fail when they distort rather than convey truth. The *evolutionist* perspective understands traditions as adapted practices; they fail when environmental changes render them maladaptive. These perspectives are complementary rather than competing—a comprehensive account of tradition breakdown must attend to all four dimensions.

The institutional emphasis highlights vulnerabilities that purely epistemological accounts may miss. Traditions require bearers—individuals and institutions that actively transmit practices, beliefs, and norms across generations. When these bearers disappear or cease transmission, traditions can die even if their conceptual content remains coherent. The institutional perspective also reveals how traditions can be weakened through disconnection from practice: when traditions become objects of academic study rather than lived commitments, their character changes fundamentally.

Spengler (1926), though philosophically controversial, provides an influential framework for understanding cultural decline that has shaped subsequent tradition theory. His distinction between creative "culture" and ossified "civilization" parallels the living/dead tradition distinction. While his biological determinism and cyclical inevitability claims have been widely rejected, his phenomenology of cultural vitality loss—the replacement of organic creativity with mechanical repetition, spiritual depth with technical proficiency—captures something real about how traditions can hollow out while maintaining external form.

Herman (1997) traces the intellectual history of declinist thought, showing recurring patterns in how Western thinkers have theorized cultural breakdown. Bennett (2008) examines contemporary cultural pessimism, noting a crucial paradox: narratives of decline may themselves contribute to the breakdown they diagnose. When cultural participants lose confidence in the value and transmissibility of their traditions, this pessimism can become self-fulfilling. The dialectical relationship between decline narratives and actual decline complicates any simple diagnosis of tradition pathology.

### 2.3 Living vs. Dead Traditions: Criteria for Health

The metaphor of "living" versus "dead" traditions pervades discussion of tradition breakdown, but precise analytical criteria remain elusive. Beckstein (2017) offers the most systematic recent attempt, arguing that living traditions exhibit four interrelated features. First, they sustain ongoing internal debate about their core commitments and what these commitments require in practice. Second, they demonstrate capacity for creative adaptation—changing in response to new circumstances while maintaining continuity with their past. Third, they involve authentic continuation rather than mere repetition—participants engage substantively with inherited material rather than simply reproducing it mechanically. Fourth, participants are actively engaged rather than passively inheriting—tradition is something done, not merely received.

These criteria help diagnose different pathologies. A tradition can die through ossification: internal debate ceases, creativity gives way to repetition, engagement becomes passive reception. It can also die through dissolution: debate becomes so fractious that continuity breaks down, adaptation becomes abandonment, and the tradition loses coherent identity. Both represent failures of the living tradition's essential balance between continuity and change.

Hollenbach (2019) draws a crucial distinction between "living tradition" and "traditionalism," which he characterizes (following Jaroslav Pelikan) as "the dead faith of the living" contrasted with "the living faith of the dead." Traditionalism involves rigid adherence to past formulations without creative engagement—treating inherited material as unchangeable deposit rather than living resource. Importantly, traditionalism often emerges precisely when traditions feel threatened: the defensive posture that refuses adaptation actually accelerates decline by blocking the creative development living traditions require.

Alexander's (2012; 2015) comparative analysis of Arendt, Oakeshott, and MacIntyre reveals that even philosophers who valorize tradition disagree fundamentally about what tradition breakdown means. Arendt sees the "break in tradition" as accomplished fact—modern political experience has ruptured continuity with the past, and no return is possible. Oakeshott, by contrast, holds that tradition is inevitably present in all human activity; the appearance of breakdown is an illusion produced by rationalist ideology. MacIntyre occupies a middle position: tradition is genuinely endangered by modernity's fragmentation, but recoverable through conscious adherence to practices that embody traditional rationality. These different diagnoses imply different prescriptions: if Arendt is right, we must think without tradition's guidance; if Oakeshott is right, we need only recognize tradition's inescapability; if MacIntyre is right, we must actively rebuild traditional communities of practice.

Zhavoronkov (2018) adds an important dimension by examining how appeals to "tradition" can mask anti-traditional nihilism. Drawing on Arendt's analysis of totalitarianism, he shows how radical conservative movements invoke tradition while actually destroying its conditions of possibility. Pseudo-traditions emerge: superficial invocations of traditional forms that serve ideological purposes while emptying those forms of genuine content. Traditions can thus fail not only by dying out but by being corrupted into simulacra—maintaining appearance while losing substance.

### 2.4 Hermeneutic Failure and Transmission Breakdown

Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics provides complementary resources for understanding tradition breakdown. Where MacIntyre emphasizes epistemological crisis, Gadamer (2006) frames tradition as ongoing dialogue between past and present, mediated through effective history (Wirkungsgeschichte). Understanding requires both distance from and belonging to tradition; the interpreter stands within effective history while also encountering tradition as something foreign that challenges present assumptions. Gander (2004) explicates how this tension between strangeness and familiarity is productive rather than problematic—it enables the "fusion of horizons" that constitutes genuine understanding.

Odenstedt (2017) applies this framework to diagnose tradition's transformation in modernity. The "decline of tradition" involves not disappearance but a qualitative shift in how tradition operates. Pre-modern traditions functioned through relatively organic transmission—participants simply inhabited their traditions without reflexive awareness that they were doing so. Modernity introduces reflexive self-consciousness: we become aware of traditions as traditions, as historical inheritances that could have been otherwise. This awareness alters tradition's character, requiring explicit reconstruction where once implicit transmission sufficed. Traditions become objects of choice rather than simply givens.

This hermeneutic perspective reveals tradition breakdown as failure of dialogical engagement. Traditions remain living when participants engage them interpretively—questioning, appropriating, applying inherited material to new situations. When the hermeneutic circle closes prematurely—when interpretation becomes dogmatic repetition rather than genuine dialogue—tradition dies even if its external forms persist. The circularity of interpretation (understanding parts through wholes and wholes through parts) must remain open to revision; when it closes, tradition ossifies.

The social epistemology of knowledge transmission extends these insights. Greco (2020) analyzes knowledge transmission as distinct from generation, emphasizing that transmission depends on interpersonal trust and cooperative social structures. McMyler (2022) argues that cultural knowledge transmission extends beyond paradigmatic testimony to include non-testimonial forms of learning: imitation, emulation, guided practice, ritual participation. Traditions transmit not only explicit beliefs but tacit knowledge embedded in practices. Muller (2024) develops this further through the concept of "cumulative cultural knowledge"—knowledge that accumulates across generations through refinement and transmission, exceeding what any individual could generate alone.

This literature suggests tradition breakdown can occur through disruption of any transmission channel. Testimonial failure—when explicit teachings lose credibility or cease being passed on—is only one possibility. Traditions also fail when participatory practices are disrupted, when ritual contexts that transmit tacit knowledge disappear, when trust between generations erodes. The hermeneutic and social-epistemological perspectives thus reveal tradition breakdown as not merely conceptual failure but practical disruption—the collapse of the interpretive communities and cooperative structures through which traditions live.

### 2.5 Political Traditions and Legitimacy

Political traditions face distinctive challenges related to authority, legitimacy, and democratic accountability. Wall (2016) examines whether and when traditions possess authority in political morality. He distinguishes epistemic authority—traditions may track truth about political goods through accumulated experience—from practical authority—traditions coordinate action and sustain valuable practices regardless of their truth-tracking capacity. Both forms of authority are genuine but defeasible; they must be balanced against independent moral considerations and can be overridden when traditions prove oppressive or mistaken.

This analysis illuminates how political traditions can fail differently than purely cultural ones. A political tradition might lose epistemic authority if it no longer tracks political goods—if its inherited wisdom becomes obsolete or systematically distorted. It might lose practical authority if it can no longer coordinate action effectively—if participants no longer recognize its claims as binding. Either form of authority loss represents tradition breakdown, but they require different responses and may occur independently.

Stout (2003) complicates any simple opposition between democracy and tradition by arguing that democratic discourse is itself a tradition. Democracy absorbs and transforms inherited practices rather than rejecting them; it represents a distinctive way of negotiating among multiple traditions within pluralistic societies. This suggests political tradition breakdown might involve not the victory of democracy over tradition but the failure of democratic tradition itself—the loss of those practices through which citizens negotiate their differences and transmit democratic commitments across generations.

Bellamy (2007) develops political constitutionalism as an alternative to legal constitutionalism, emphasizing that constitutional norms emerge from and are sustained by democratic political contestation rather than being imposed by courts. Constitutional traditions are living practices embodied in democratic institutions, not fixed texts requiring judicial interpretation. This framework helps explain how constitutional traditions can degenerate: when political contestation gives way to judicial settlement, when constitutional meaning becomes fixed rather than evolving through practice, the living dimension of constitutional tradition atrophies.

Church (1999) applies MacIntyre's framework directly to American constitutional tradition, arguing it has entered epistemological crisis. Core constitutional commitments—individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty—have become mutually incoherent when applied to contemporary problems. The endless controversy that characterizes constitutional debate signals not healthy disagreement but breakdown: the tradition can no longer resolve disputes using its internal resources. Whether resolution is possible, Church argues, requires narrative reconstruction that makes previous constitutional understandings and their failure intelligible.

Lukic (2023) extends this analysis through the concept of "intelligibility crisis," applying it to Yugoslav political tradition. When political narratives collapse, people lose the capacity to make sense of their situation—they cannot connect meaningfully to new contexts because their previous narrative framework has disintegrated. Political tradition breakdown thus involves not just institutional failure but loss of the narrative coherence that made political life intelligible. The Yugoslav case illustrates how rapidly such collapse can occur and how profoundly disorienting it proves for those who lived within the tradition.

Buchanan (2003) and Beetham (1991) remind us that traditional authority alone cannot ground political legitimacy. Even well-functioning political traditions require independent moral justification; legitimacy demands not merely that power be exercised according to tradition but that the tradition itself be morally defensible. Rosenfeld (2009) explores how constitutional identity is constructed through interplay of inherited traditions and constitutional commitments to equality and pluralism—a construction requiring both continuity with tradition and critical distance from it. Political traditions thus face a distinctive legitimacy burden that cultural traditions may escape.

### Section Summary

Tradition breakdown emerges from this analysis as a multi-dimensional phenomenon. MacIntyre's epistemological crisis framework identifies conceptual failure: traditions break down when their existing resources cannot solve problems or make sense of experience, and when they cannot construct narratives that explain their crisis. The institutional perspective adds sociological dimensions: traditions depend on bearers and transmission mechanisms whose collapse can destroy traditions even if their conceptual content remains viable. The living/dead tradition distinction provides criteria for assessing tradition health—internal debate, creative adaptation, authentic engagement—and reveals how traditions can die through both ossification and dissolution. Hermeneutic and social-epistemological approaches reveal tradition as interpretive practice; breakdown involves the closure of dialogical engagement and disruption of transmission channels beyond explicit testimony. Political traditions face additional vulnerabilities related to authority and legitimacy that pure cultural traditions may not share.

These perspectives are interconnected rather than competing. Epistemological crisis often produces institutional stress; institutional failure can precipitate conceptual incoherence; hermeneutic closure may reflect or cause both. A comprehensive understanding of tradition breakdown requires attending to all these dimensions while recognizing that different traditions may be more vulnerable to different pathologies. The literature provides rich resources for diagnosing tradition failure, though application to concrete political and cultural traditions remains underdeveloped.
