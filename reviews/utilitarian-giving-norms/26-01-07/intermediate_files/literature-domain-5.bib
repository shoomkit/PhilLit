====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses normative philosophical debates about whether redistribution
should target income flows or accumulated wealth/assets. Three major positions emerge:
(1) Luck egalitarians argue that unearned advantages—especially inherited wealth—create
unjust inequalities that should be neutralized through asset taxation; (2) Libertarians
(right and left variants) debate whether wealth accumulation violates self-ownership or
merely reflects historical entitlements; (3) Murphy & Nagel's "conventional ownership"
view rejects pre-tax property rights, treating all taxation as part of a unified
distributive scheme. Recent work by Halliday, Pedersen, and Fleischer explores
inheritance taxation specifically, while Delmotte & Cowen question the technical
feasibility of wealth taxes. The debate intersects with questions about desert (earned
vs. unearned income), responsibility (choice vs. brute luck), and the appropriate
currency of egalitarian justice (resources, welfare, or capabilities).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
While this literature focuses on coercive taxation rather than voluntary giving, it
provides essential normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets in
distributive schemes. Luck egalitarian arguments about inherited wealth map directly
onto questions about whether utilitarian giving obligations should apply differently to
earned income versus inherited assets. The Murphy-Nagel critique of "everyday
libertarianism" about taxes parallels potential objections to asset-based giving norms.
Debates about the "currency" of justice (income, wealth, opportunities) inform how we
specify what utilitarians have obligations to redistribute.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very little explicit discussion of how these taxation arguments apply to voluntary
charitable redistribution. The literature assumes state coercion; adapting these
frameworks to individual moral obligations requires additional normative work. Also
limited engagement with behavioral dimensions of asset holdings (liquidity constraints,
valuation problems) that would affect giving capacity.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, contrast luck egalitarian arguments for asset taxation with
libertarian defenses of inheritance rights. Note how Murphy & Nagel dissolve the
income/wealth distinction by denying pre-tax property rights entirely—a radical
position that may have analogs in demanding utilitarian views. Consider whether Rawls's
rejection of inheritance taxes undermines his general egalitarianism.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Luck Egalitarianism (8 papers): Inherited wealth creates unjust inequality; tax unearned advantages
- Libertarianism/Self-Ownership (4 papers): Voluntary transfers respect autonomy; taxation violates rights
- Conventional Ownership (Murphy & Nagel, 2 papers): No pre-tax property rights; income/wealth distinction arbitrary
- Left-Libertarianism (2 papers): Self-ownership compatible with egalitarian distribution of natural resources
- Capability Approach (2 papers): Focus on functionings/opportunities rather than income or wealth per se

  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198803355.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends robust inheritance taxation through a "Rignano scheme" where inherited wealth faces progressively higher tax rates with each generation, aiming to prevent dynastic accumulation while respecting limited bequest rights. Argues inheritance undermines both democratic equality and fair equality of opportunity by creating unearned advantages that compound across generations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most thorough recent philosophical treatment of inherited wealth as a distinct category deserving differential treatment from earned income. The multi-generational perspective on asset accumulation directly informs questions about whether utilitarian obligations to give should apply more stringently to inherited assets than earned income. Halliday's focus on preventing "dynastic concentrations" parallels concerns about asset-based privilege in giving contexts.

  POSITION: Luck egalitarian with emphasis on equality of opportunity; rejects both complete inheritance abolition and unlimited bequest rights in favor of graduated taxation scheme.

  number = {2},
  pages = {211--234},
  doi = {10.1080/13698230.2019.1644585},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques wealth taxation proposals by arguing that capital assets lack determinate values except at realization points (sale, transfer, profit-taking). Mark-to-market taxation would be "arbitrary and unfair" because capital valuation is dynamic and subjective, not static. Proposes instead broadening income tax base to include imputed rent from housing wealth and eliminating preferential tax treatment for specific sectors.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to questions about whether giving obligations should target wealth holdings versus income flows. The epistemological argument about asset valuation applies equally to voluntary redistribution—individuals may face severe informational and liquidity problems in assessing their true wealth for giving purposes. Suggests income-based norms may be more practically implementable than asset-based ones, even if the latter seems more just in principle.

  POSITION: Critical of wealth taxation from classical liberal/neoclassical economics perspective; favors income-realization approach to taxation.

  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  isbn = {9780195176568},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rejects "everyday libertarianism" that treats pre-tax income as morally owned and taxation as confiscation. Argues property rights are conventional—constituted by the legal system including tax law—so there is no pre-political baseline from which to assess redistribution. Taxes are part of the system that defines what people own, not a taking from what they already own. Evaluates tax systems holistically by their distributive outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamental challenge to intuitions about "earned" income versus government redistribution. If correct, the income/wealth distinction may be equally conventional—there is no natural baseline from which inherited assets are "more" subject to redistribution than earned income. This view supports treating all resources as equally available for utilitarian redistribution, whether acquired through labor or inheritance. However, the argument's focus on legal/political construction may not translate directly to moral obligations of voluntary giving.

  POSITION: Conventional ownership theory; rejects libertarian property rights; emphasizes holistic evaluation of tax-and-transfer systems.

  doi = {10.1111/phc3.12491},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys four main approaches to inheritance taxation: (1) Mill's scheme limiting receipt rather than bequest, (2) Rawls's acceptance of inheritance with background wealth constraints, (3) Rignano's progressively increasing tax on multigenerational wealth, (4) Haslett's proposal to abolish inheritance entirely. Evaluates each against equality of opportunity, desert-based, and relational egalitarian standards.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic overview of normative frameworks for distinguishing inherited from earned resources. The contrast between limiting bequest (donor-side) versus receipt (heir-side) taxation maps onto questions about whether giving obligations fall on asset holders or income earners. Mill's focus on recipient limits rather than donor restrictions has parallels in effective altruism's emphasis on individual donor discretion within certain bounds.

  number = {1},
  pages = {90--117},
  doi = {10.1017/S0265052523000092},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues from within libertarian framework that inheritance taxation to recipients is compatible with—even required by—classical liberal principles. Applies benefit theory of taxation: heirs receive state protection of their inheritance, so should pay for that benefit. Also argues inheritance taxes curb dynastic political power and prevent wealthy families from insulating members from market discipline, both consistent with libertarian values of limited government and free markets.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that even property-rights-focused libertarianism may support differential treatment of inherited versus earned resources. If taxation of inherited wealth can be justified on libertarian grounds, voluntary giving obligations might apply even more strongly to unearned advantages. The market-discipline argument suggests inherited assets represent genuine moral differences from labor income, not merely arbitrary accounting categories.

  POSITION: Libertarian defense of inheritance taxation; challenges right-libertarian opposition to estate/gift taxes.

  volume = {8},
  pages = {39--64},
  doi = {10.31009/LEAP.2020.V8.03},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critical engagement with Halliday's inheritance taxation scheme. Questions whether right to bequeath is as robust as Halliday assumes and whether background institutional arrangements might justify stronger restrictions. Raises concerns about Halliday's egalitarian credentials and interpretation of equality of opportunity, suggesting the Rignano scheme may be too permissive from egalitarian perspective.

  RELEVANCE: Sharpens the debate about how stringently egalitarian principles apply to inherited wealth. If even Halliday's moderate scheme is insufficiently egalitarian, this suggests very strong presumptions against treating inherited assets as legitimately owned for purposes of personal consumption rather than redistribution. Relevant to questions about how demanding utilitarian giving obligations should be when applied to inherited versus earned resources.

  POSITION: Stronger egalitarian critique of inheritance; suggests Halliday's scheme too permissive from equality of opportunity perspective.

  volume = {28},
  number = {4},
  pages = {425--447},
  doi = {10.1111/jopp.12216},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Mill's proposal to limit how much each person can receive from wealth transfers (via inheritance or gift) while leaving donors free to distribute as they wish. Argues this respects both equality of opportunity (by preventing excessive unearned advantages for recipients) and legitimate parental concern (by not restricting bequest amounts). Superior to estate taxes because it focuses on recipient's cumulative advantage rather than single transfer.

  RELEVANCE: Mill's recipient-focused approach has direct parallels to utilitarian giving frameworks that emphasize individual responsibility for how resources are used rather than collective obligations to avoid certain sources. The cumulative lifetime receipt cap maps onto questions about whether giving obligations should adjust based on total asset holdings regardless of source. Suggests treating all unearned advantages symmetrically rather than distinguishing inheritance from other windfalls.

  POSITION: Modified luck egalitarian position based on Mill; recipient-side limits on wealth transfers rather than bequest taxation.

  volume = {36},
  number = {3},
  pages = {471--487},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.12346},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes relationship between inheritance and equality of opportunity, showing it is "quite complex" depending on how equality of opportunity is interpreted and integrated with other principles. Distinguishes formal, fair, and radical interpretations of equal opportunity, arguing inheritance taxation is only required under fair or radical conceptions but not formal ones. Also considers family-value considerations that might justify some inheritance even under demanding egalitarian standards.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the normative significance of distinguishing earned from inherited resources from equality-of-opportunity perspective. The complexity thesis suggests simple income/wealth distinctions may obscure important normative questions—what matters is how resources relate to individual responsibility and choice, not their formal categorization. Relevant to specifying conditions under which inherited assets trigger stronger utilitarian obligations than labor income.

  POSITION: Analyzes multiple equality-of-opportunity conceptions; suggests family considerations create tensions for inheritance taxation even under egalitarian frameworks.

  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {1981},
  volume = {10},
  number = {4},
  pages = {283--345},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques welfare-based equality in favor of resource-based equality. Argues equality of welfare faces insurmountable problems: expensive tastes, adaptive preferences, and inability to distinguish genuine disadvantage from preference differences. Defends equality of resources as the appropriate egalitarian metric, later developing this through hypothetical insurance markets and "envy test" thought experiments.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for resource-egalitarian approaches that distinguish earned from unearned advantages. Dworkin's resource metric focuses on individual endowments (talents, wealth) that are morally arbitrary starting points requiring equalization. This framework suggests inherited wealth and labor-market advantages from natural talents both create unjust inequalities, but through different mechanisms. Relevant to specifying what resources utilitarian obligations should target for redistribution.

  POSITION: Resource egalitarianism; rejects welfare equality in favor of equalizing starting points through hypothetical insurance schemes.

  number = {2},
  pages = {287--337},
  doi = {10.1086/233897},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques "luck egalitarianism" (especially Dworkin, Arneson, Cohen) for misidentifying the point of egalitarian justice. Argues the core concern should be democratic equality—ensuring all can participate as equals in civil society—rather than neutralizing the effects of brute luck on resource holdings. Luck egalitarian policies risk stigmatizing those who make "bad choices" and may leave the imprudent destitute, undermining social equality.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the entire framework of distinguishing earned from unearned advantages that motivates much inheritance taxation debate. If Anderson is correct that relational equality rather than distributive patterns is fundamental, then income/wealth distinctions may matter less than ensuring everyone has sufficient resources for equal standing. However, her focus on democratic participation may support inheritance limits to prevent dynastic political power, even while rejecting luck-egalitarian rationales.

  volume = {56},
  number = {1},
  pages = {77--93},
  doi = {10.1007/BF00646210},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "equal opportunity for welfare" as the appropriate egalitarian metric, combining welfare-focused outcomes with responsibility-sensitive distribution. Individuals should have equal opportunities to achieve welfare, but resulting inequalities from different choices are acceptable. Brute luck inequalities (from circumstances beyond individual control) should be neutralized, while option luck (voluntary gambles) may justify inequality.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational luck egalitarian position that directly addresses when resource inequalities are just versus unjust. Inherited wealth represents paradigmatic brute luck disadvantage requiring compensation, while income differentials from chosen effort may be justified. However, the article predates inheritance-specific applications and doesn't fully address how natural talent endowments (affecting earning capacity) should be treated—a gap relevant to earned income obligations.

  pages = {906--944},
  doi = {10.1086/293126},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques both welfare-focused and resource-focused egalitarianism in favor of "equality of access to advantage." Argues Dworkin's resource equality fails to address disadvantages from low talent/ability (which affect conversion of resources to welfare), while Arneson's welfare equality gives perverse incentives regarding expensive tastes. Proposes broader conception of advantage that includes both resources and welfare-generating capacities.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the "currency question" central to income/wealth debates—what should egalitarian principles equalize? Cohen's broader conception of advantage suggests both inherited wealth and natural earnings capacity create morally arbitrary inequalities requiring compensation. This implies utilitarian obligations may apply to both asset holdings and high earning potential, not just one or the other. The conversion-of-resources issue parallels practical questions about asset liquidity and giving capacity.

  POSITION: Broader luck egalitarianism; equality of access to advantage including both resources and capacities.

  title = {Anarchy, State, and Utopia},
  year = {1974},
  publisher = {Basic Books},
  address = {New York},
  isbn = {9780465097203},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends libertarian "entitlement theory" of justice in holdings. Just distribution depends entirely on history: How did people acquire holdings (initial acquisition) and how were they transferred (voluntary exchange/gift)? Any "end-state" or "patterned" distributive principles (including income or wealth taxation beyond minimal state funding) violate individual rights by continually interfering with voluntary exchanges to maintain the pattern.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational libertarian objection to redistributive taxation of any kind, whether income or wealth-based. Nozick's focus on historical process rather than distributive outcomes challenges the premise that unearned advantages like inheritance are morally problematic—if acquired through just transfer (bequest), inheritance is as legitimate as earned income. However, even Nozick accepts taxation can be justified if initial acquisition was unjust, opening door to corrective redistribution of dynastic wealth traceable to historical injustice.

  address = {Oxford},
  isbn = {9780198293576},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "left-libertarian" position combining self-ownership (no forced labor, respect for individual autonomy) with egalitarian distribution of external resources (natural resources, inherited wealth, social product). Proposes universal basic income funded by taxation of resource rents and inherited advantages. Argues this maximizes real freedom—the resources to pursue one's conception of the good—for those with least opportunity.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how to reconcile libertarian commitments to individual autonomy with egalitarian concerns about unearned advantages. Van Parijs's framework suggests earned income from labor should be largely tax-free (respecting self-ownership) while inherited wealth and resource rents face heavy taxation (equalizing external advantages). This maps onto potential distinctions between income-based and asset-based giving obligations, though Van Parijs focuses on state redistribution rather than voluntary charity.

  author = {Steiner, Hillel},
  title = {An Essay on Rights},
  journal = {Oxford},
  year = {1994},
  publisher = {Blackwell},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops rigorous left-libertarian theory where all persons have equal rights to natural resources (including land, raw materials, scarce opportunities). Self-ownership is lexically prior, but equal division of natural resource value requires redistributive taxation. Inheritance of legitimately-acquired resources is permissible, but inheritance of unequal shares of natural resources violates equal rights and should be fully taxed.

  RELEVANCE: Provides sharp distinction between two kinds of wealth: (1) product of individual labor (protected by self-ownership), (2) appropriation of natural resources (subject to equality constraint). Inherited wealth typically includes both components, requiring careful decomposition to determine legitimate versus illegitimate portions. This framework could support differential giving obligations based on whether assets derive from labor versus resource appropriation, though implementation faces severe measurement problems.

  journal = {Libertarianism.org},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.4324/9781317486794.ch18},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends libertarian view that redistributive taxation violates property rights, responding to Murphy-Nagel's "conventional ownership" argument. Argues that even if property rights are conventional, individuals still have moral entitlements to their pre-tax income based on contribution and desert. Taxation for redistribution constitutes forced labor because it appropriates time and effort individuals invested in earning income.

  RELEVANCE: Articulates stronger libertarian objection to redistribution than Nozick's purely procedural entitlement theory by invoking desert-based claims. If Huemer is correct that individuals deserve their pre-tax income, this might extend to inheritance (heirs deserve bequests their benefactors chose to give them). However, desert-based arguments are more plausible for earned income than inherited wealth, suggesting possible asymmetry in libertarian defenses of income versus asset holdings.

  volume = {95},
  pages = {1--87},
  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.3724691},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that egalitarian optimal tax theory (welfarist approach to taxation) addresses major philosophical objections better than resource egalitarianism. Proposes three innovations: (1) welfare-weighted Pigouvian taxes for other-regarding preferences, (2) risk-neutral endowment taxation based partially on ex ante potential income, (3) treating choices as less informative about well-being when distant in past or highly predictable. Claims this narrows gap between welfarism and resource egalitarianism.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges philosophical debates about distributive justice with economic optimal tax literature. The risk-neutral endowment tax proposal directly addresses inherited advantages—taxing potential income capacity rather than realized earnings could capture both natural talent and inherited wealth. The temporal discounting of choice-responsibility challenges strong distinctions between earned and unearned income if earning capacity itself reflects unchosen endowments determined long ago.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops republican theory of economic justice centered on non-domination and democratic sovereignty over the economy. Proposes universal basic income, capital grants, progressive taxation of inheritance and wealth, workplace democracy, and democratic control of investment. Argues these institutions advance republican freedom by reducing economic domination and enabling democratic participation in shaping the economy for the common good.

  RELEVANCE: Recent systematic treatment connecting wealth inequality to republican freedom concerns. The capital grants proposal explicitly targets inherited advantage by redistributing wealth holdings to equalize starting points, going beyond income redistribution. Inheritance taxation justified not by luck egalitarian principles but by preventing domination through concentrated wealth. This provides alternative normative foundation for differential treatment of inherited versus earned resources based on power relations rather than desert or responsibility.

  POSITION: Republican theory of justice; non-domination requires redistribution of wealth holdings; supports universal capital grants and inheritance taxation.
