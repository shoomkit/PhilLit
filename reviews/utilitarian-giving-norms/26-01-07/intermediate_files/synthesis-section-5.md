## Research Gaps, Opportunities, and Conclusion

The preceding sections have mapped an extensive literature spanning utilitarian obligations, marginal utility research, and temporal considerations in philanthropy. Yet this literature exhibits significant lacunae precisely where the income-versus-assets question demands answers. Four interconnected gaps emerge as particularly consequential for developing a principled account of giving obligations.

### Gap 1: No Direct Comparison of Income-Based Versus Asset-Based Giving Obligations

The philosophical literature on utilitarian giving obligations discusses what affluent individuals owe without specifying whether obligations derive from income flows or asset stocks. Singer's (1972) foundational argument that we should prevent suffering "without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance" leaves indeterminate which resources constitute the obligatory base. Unger's (1996) Vintage Sedan thought experiment---notably involving destruction of an *asset* rather than sacrifice of income---suggests intuitions may favor treating assets as morally available for redistribution, yet this implication remains undeveloped. Murphy's (2000) cooperative principle limits obligations to fair shares of collective action but does not address whether fair shares should be calculated against income, wealth, or some combination. Cullity's (2004) life-project constraint might justify protecting assets differently from income if long-term projects depend more on asset security, but this possibility is not explored.

The effective altruism movement institutionalized giving obligations through income-based norms---Giving What We Can's 10% pledge, Singer's graduated income scale---without providing principled justification for choosing income over assets as the baseline (MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord 2018; Singer 2015). Aloyo (2023) critiques this income focus, arguing that wealth inequality exceeds income inequality and that focusing on income allows the very rich to discharge obligations cheaply. Yet Aloyo's proposal for progressive wealth-sensitive norms does not develop the systematic comparison that utilitarian analysis requires.

This gap matters because marginal utility differs systematically between income and assets. If empirical evidence establishes that assets beyond a security threshold contribute little to donor welfare while recipients' marginal utility from additional resources remains high, utilitarian calculations may strongly favor asset-based norms. The absence of direct philosophical treatment leaves this possibility unexamined.

### Gap 2: No Defined "Security Threshold" for Assets

Empirical research establishes that assets provide utility through mechanisms distinct from consumption---primarily security, optionality, and stress reduction. Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2013) demonstrate that the marginal utility of consumption is state-dependent, varying with health status and implying that assets held for insurance have diminishing marginal value beyond what is needed to cover reasonable risks. Kushlev, Dunn, and Lucas (2015) find that income reduces sadness rather than increasing happiness, suggesting financial resources primarily buffer against negative states rather than generating positive ones. D'Ambrosio, Jantti, and Lepinteur (2019) show wealth provides distinct security benefits beyond what income offers. Tay and colleagues (2016) demonstrate that debt has strongly negative effects on well-being independent of income or gross assets, indicating that net wealth matters crucially for utility.

These findings collectively suggest a threshold hypothesis: assets provide high marginal utility up to some level necessary for financial security---emergency funds, retirement adequacy, insurance against health shocks---but low marginal utility beyond that threshold. Jantsch, Le Blanc, and Schmidt (2024) find that financial assets have stronger well-being effects than real assets, reinforcing the security interpretation. Wiepking and Breeze (2012) show that *subjective* financial security predicts giving behavior more strongly than objective resources, indicating psychological thresholds matter for behavioral compliance as well.

Yet no paper articulates this threshold for giving obligation purposes. Without a defined threshold, asset-based norms risk two failure modes: demanding too much by requiring liquidation of security-providing assets, or permitting too much by allowing indefinite asset accumulation under the guise of precautionary saving. A principled utilitarian analysis requires specifying when assets transition from protected reserves to resources subject to redistribution.

### Gap 3: Unresolved Tension Between Time Neutralism and Patient Philanthropy for Individual Obligations

The philosophical literature on temporal discounting yields a strong case for time neutralism: Greaves (2017) surveys arguments comprehensively and concludes that pure time preference lacks ethical justification, though practical discounting may be warranted by opportunity costs of capital. Greene (2021) defends time neutralism against permissivists, arguing that temporal location should not affect the weight of moral reasons. If temporal location is morally arbitrary, obligations to give from assets in the future are no less weighty than obligations to give from income now.

Patient philanthropy literature, particularly Trammell's (2020) formal models, shows that if investment returns compound faster than the opportunity cost of delay, deferred giving could multiply philanthropic impact dramatically. The Founders Pledge (2021) Patient Philanthropy Fund represents practical implementation of this theory. However, Greaves and MacAskill (2021) argue that the present may constitute a "hinge of history" where current action is uniquely influential, favoring immediate deployment of resources.

The critical gap is that both time neutralism and patient philanthropy focus on institutional fund management, not individual moral obligations. Trammell's models concern how philanthropic vehicles should allocate resources across time; they do not address whether an individual's personal asset accumulation---with vague intention to give later---satisfies the same obligations as regular income-based giving. Time neutralism establishes that future giving has equal moral weight, but this does not determine whether holding assets with intent to give later counts as *currently* fulfilling obligations or merely *deferring* them. The distinction matters enormously for normative guidance: if asset accumulation satisfies obligations, asset-based norms might be *less* demanding than income norms (give later, but more); if it constitutes deferral, asset-holders face ongoing unfulfilled obligations regardless of future intentions.

### Gap 4: Limited Integration Across Domains

The literatures on distributive justice, charitable ethics, and behavioral giving research remain largely separate. Luck egalitarian arguments for wealth taxation---Halliday's (2018) Rignano scheme, Dworkin's (1981) resource egalitarianism---provide normative frameworks for treating inherited wealth differently from earned income, yet these frameworks do not appear in effective altruism literature on giving norms. Murphy and Nagel (2002) argue that pre-tax property rights are "mythical" and all resources are equally available for just redistribution, a radical position that would dissolve the income-wealth distinction entirely---but this view has not been applied to voluntary charitable obligations. Behavioral research on giving predictors (Bekkers and Wiepking 2011; Meer and Priday 2020) shows that income and wealth independently predict giving through different mechanisms, yet this empirical finding rarely informs normative philosophy.

This fragmentation means existing frameworks may already favor asset-based norms---or reveal principled objections---without this being recognized. The taxation literature's epistemological concerns about asset valuation (Delmotte and Cowen 2022) apply equally to voluntary giving but are rarely acknowledged in philosophical discussions. Ring and Thoresen's (2025) finding that wealth taxes *reduce* charitable giving in Norway has important implications for whether asset-based giving norms would face behavioral resistance, yet behavioral evidence is rarely integrated with normative analysis.

### Conclusion

The reviewed literature establishes strong philosophical foundations for utilitarian giving obligations, moderated by legitimate demandingness constraints. Empirical evidence demonstrates systematic differences in how income and assets contribute to well-being: income affects day-to-day consumption and emotional buffering, while assets provide security, optionality, and life-evaluation benefits that may plateau beyond threshold levels (Headey 2019; Kahneman and Deaton 2010; Killingsworth, Kahneman, and Mellers 2023). Temporal considerations complicate rather than resolve the analysis: time neutralism supports equal moral weight for future giving, but whether individual asset accumulation satisfies or defers obligations remains unaddressed.

Current philanthropic practice, centered on income-based norms like Giving What We Can's 10% pledge, lacks principled justification for treating asset accumulation as morally neutral. This may reflect practical considerations---income is easier to measure, automatic deduction is psychologically more tractable, and regular giving may strengthen commitment through habit formation (Andreoni and Serra-Garcia 2017)---rather than utilitarian superiority. The behavioral literature suggests that asset-based giving faces distinct psychological barriers: wealth feels less liquid than income, asset liquidation requires active decisions that can be indefinitely postponed, and subjective financial security mediates the resource-giving relationship (Wiepking and Breeze 2012).

The principal gaps concern: (1) the absence of direct philosophical comparison between income-based and asset-based obligations under consistent utilitarian assumptions; (2) the lack of any specified security threshold distinguishing obligatory giving from protected savings; (3) the unresolved temporal status of individual asset-holding relative to present giving obligations; and (4) insufficient integration of distributive justice frameworks, marginal utility evidence, and behavioral findings.

A systematic analysis addressing these gaps would provide the first principled utilitarian comparison of income-based and asset-based giving norms. Such an analysis would incorporate marginal utility asymmetries documented in empirical literature, develop an explicit threshold model for when assets become subject to obligations, clarify how temporal considerations affect the moral status of asset-holding for individuals, and synthesize normative frameworks across currently fragmented literatures. If asset-based norms prove utilitarian-superior, this would have significant practical implications for how affluent individuals should structure their giving---potentially favoring a self-imposed wealth tax over income tithing, or hybrid approaches that protect security-providing assets while requiring redistribution of excess wealth.
