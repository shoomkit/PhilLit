## Introduction

In 1972, Peter Singer argued that affluent individuals face stringent moral obligations to prevent suffering when they can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance (Singer 1972). This deceptively simple principle—applied to the empirical reality that charitable donations can prevent death and extreme poverty—generates demanding conclusions about how much the wealthy ought to give. Singer's argument has profoundly shaped contemporary moral philosophy and, more recently, the effective altruism movement that emerged to operationalize utilitarian beneficence.

Effective altruism institutionalized Singer's insights through practical commitment mechanisms, most notably the Giving What We Can pledge to donate at least 10% of gross income to highly effective charities (MacAskill 2015; Singer 2015). This income-based framework has become the default structure for organized giving: the movement tracks donations as income percentages, career advice centers on "earning to give" from high-income professions, and moral progress is measured through pledge fulfillment. MacAskill's foundational work treats current income as the primary locus of moral agency in giving decisions.

Yet this income-focused approach raises a puzzle that the philosophical literature has largely overlooked: Why income rather than assets? The 10% income pledge treats asset accumulation as morally neutral—an individual who earns modestly while holding substantial wealth may satisfy the pledge while giving far less than their total resources would permit. Unger's (1996) famous Vintage Sedan case, in which we must sacrifice a valuable possession to save a life, notably involves an asset rather than income. The original utilitarian logic appears indifferent to whether obligatory resources derive from salary, savings, or inherited wealth. If preventing suffering without comparable sacrifice is what morality demands, the source of one's resources seems irrelevant.

This review investigates a specific research question: Does a systematic asymmetry in the marginal utility of income versus assets provide normative grounds for preferring one giving base over the other? If giving from income and giving from assets have different welfare implications for the donor—owing to psychological security, consumption patterns, or temporal considerations—then utilitarian calculation may favor asset-sensitive giving strategies over the income-based norms that currently dominate.

The review proceeds as follows. Section 1 establishes the philosophical foundations of utilitarian giving obligations and surveys demandingness constraints that shape permissible norm designs. Section 2 examines empirical evidence on marginal utility differences between income and wealth, identifying a possible "security threshold" that distinguishes high-utility from low-utility assets. Section 3 considers temporal dimensions—time discounting, patient philanthropy, and behavioral feasibility—that complicate the income-asset comparison. The review concludes by identifying specific gaps in the literature and positioning the research contribution.
