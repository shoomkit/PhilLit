DOMAIN: Utilitarian Obligations to Charity — Foundational Arguments
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes the core philosophical arguments for why utilitarianism
generates obligations to give to charity. The landscape is dominated by Peter
Singer's 1972 "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," which argues from a simple
utilitarian principle: if we can prevent something bad from happening without
sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. This
argument has generated extensive debate about demandingness, the scope of
beneficence, and the definition of moral obligation. Singer's work has been
refined through discussions of act vs. rule utilitarianism, the role of
impartiality in grounding obligations, and attempts to define "surplus" resources.
Peter Unger's "Living High and Letting Die" (1996) strengthened Singer's argument
through psychological thought experiments. More recent work explores whether
obligations are unconditional or conditional, debates about effective altruism,
and tensions between utilitarian impartiality and special relationships.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the theoretical foundation for the research project's
investigation of income-based vs. asset-based giving norms. Understanding how
utilitarian obligations are justified and what counts as "surplus" resources is
essential for evaluating whether the marginal utility asymmetry between income and
assets matters for these obligations.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on the stringency of obligations and the role of
impartiality, relatively little addresses the specific question of what resources
agents are obligated to use for beneficence. The definition of "affluence" or
"surplus" tends to remain vague, focusing on income rather than assets or wealth.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish between: (1) the logical structure of Singer's
argument, (2) responses to the demandingness objection, (3) the role of different
forms of utilitarianism, and (4) definitions of surplus resources that ground
giving obligations.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong Singer (8 papers): Obligations are stringent, agent-neutral, based on
  preventing bad outcomes
- Moderate positions (6 papers): Limiting demandingness through fair-share
  principles, collective duties
- Critical perspectives (4 papers): Challenges to utilitarian impartiality,
  structural justice critiques

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening
  without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought morally
  to do it. Applied to world poverty, this generates stringent obligations for
  affluent individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to famine
  relief and poverty reduction. The argument relies on a utilitarian principle
  combined with the empirical claim that donations can effectively prevent
  suffering. Singer contends that distance and proximity are morally irrelevant—
  our duty to save a drowning child nearby is the same as our duty to save
  distant strangers through charitable giving.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for utilitarian arguments about
  charitable giving. The research project investigates income vs. asset-based
  giving norms, and Singer's argument implicitly focuses on disposable income as
  the resource from which giving obligations derive. Understanding how Singer
  defines "comparable moral importance" and what resources are considered
  "sacrificable" is essential for evaluating whether income and assets should be
  treated differently in utilitarian frameworks.

  POSITION: Strong utilitarian consequentialism with agent-neutral impartial
  beneficence; foundational text establishing the problem space.

  author = {Unger, Peter},
  title = {Living High and Letting Die: Our Illusion of Innocence},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  year = {1996},
  doi = {10.1093/0195108590.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and strengthens Singer's argument through vivid thought
  experiments designed to overcome psychological resistance to utilitarian
  conclusions about giving. Unger presents cases (like the Vintage Sedan case)
  where readers intuitively judge that we must sacrifice valuable possessions to
  save lives, then argues these intuitions extend to distant poverty. He contends
  that psychological factors—not genuine moral considerations—explain why people
  resist Singer's conclusions. The book systematically addresses objections about
  causal efficacy, collective action, and the demandingness of utilitarian duties.

  RELEVANCE: Unger's argument directly addresses the question of what resources
  we must sacrifice. His Vintage Sedan example involves giving up an asset (a
  car) rather than income, potentially supporting asset-based giving obligations.
  However, the psychological focus may obscure whether there are genuine moral
  differences between types of resources. The project's investigation of marginal
  utility asymmetries could provide a response Unger doesn't consider.

  POSITION: Strong consequentialism, defends demanding obligations through
  psychological debunking of resistance to Singer's argument.

  title = {International Aid and the Scope of Kindness},

  volume = {105},
  number = {1},
  pages = {99--127},
  doi = {10.1086/293680},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Singer's demanding conclusions can be resisted
  without rejecting the underlying utilitarian principle. Cullity introduces a
  distinction between "direct" duties (to particular individuals we encounter) and
  "collective" duties (to contribute our fair share to collective efforts). He
  contends that while we have stringent direct duties to help those we can
  directly save, our duties regarding distant poverty are better understood as
  fair-share contributions to collective relief efforts. This limits demandingness
  while retaining the core insight that we have obligations to help.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's fair-share approach could ground different treatment of
  income vs. assets. If fair shares are calculated based on comparative wealth
  rather than absolute ability to give, asset holdings might matter independently
  of income. However, Cullity doesn't develop this possibility. The project could
  explore whether marginal utility differences between income and assets justify
  different fair-share calculations.

  POSITION: Moderate consequentialism, limiting demandingness through collective
  duty framework.

  volume = {120},
  number = {3},
  pages = {557--578},
  doi = {10.1086/652294},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the traditional distinction between negative duties
  (not to harm) and positive duties (to aid) by introducing the concept of "new
  harms"—harms that arise from our participation in global institutional
  structures. Lichtenberg argues that through consumption, trade, and political
  participation, affluent individuals contribute causally to global poverty. This
  transforms what appears to be a positive duty to aid into a negative duty to
  stop harming. The distinction matters because negative duties are typically
  considered more stringent and less subject to demandingness worries.

  RELEVANCE: Lichtenberg's argument could ground stronger obligations than
  Singer's beneficence-based approach. If giving is required to compensate for
  harm we cause through institutional participation, the question shifts from
  "how much surplus can we afford to give?" to "how much must we give to
  discharge our duty not to harm?" This reframes the income vs. assets question:
  if duties derive from harm, perhaps assets accumulated through harmful systems
  have different status than current income.

  POSITION: Reframes positive duties as negative duties; grounds obligations in
  harm rather than beneficence.

  journal = {Studies in Global Justice},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {17},
  pages = {215--238},
  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-41430-0_12},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques Singer's charitable giving approach for treating
  poverty as a humanitarian crisis requiring individual beneficence rather than
  as structural injustice requiring institutional change. Kahn argues that
  Singer's utilitarian framework obscures the political nature of poverty and
  misdirects moral energy toward charity rather than advocacy and political
  action. She contends that individuals have "collectivization duties" to work
  toward establishing just institutions, not merely duties to donate to effective
  charities. This challenges Singer's assumption that maximizing welfare through
  donations is the primary moral requirement.

  RELEVANCE: Kahn's critique raises questions about whether utilitarian
  obligations should focus on individual consumption and giving at all. If duties
  are primarily political, the income vs. assets distinction may be less
  important than questions about political participation and institutional
  reform. However, even granting political duties, residual beneficence
  obligations may remain, and the project's analysis could apply to those.

  POSITION: Justice-based critique of utilitarian charity framework; emphasizes
  institutional/political duties.

@article{jamieson2005duties,

  journal = {Journal of Ethics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {9},
  number = {1},
  pages = {151--170},
  doi = {10.1007/S10892-004-3324-9},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between Singer's original argument and
  Unger's refinement, noting that both share a commitment to consequentialist
  impartiality but differ in rhetorical strategy. Jamieson explores the tension
  between theoretical consistency (which would demand very high levels of
  sacrifice) and practical efficacy (which might require more moderate demands to
  avoid demotivating potential donors). He suggests that rule consequentialism
  might justify less demanding giving standards if demanding standards would
  reduce overall compliance and thus total welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Jamieson's discussion of rule vs. act consequentialism is directly
  relevant to asset vs. income norms. Even if act consequentialism demands equal
  treatment of income and assets, rule consequentialism might justify differential
  treatment if asset-based norms would generate resistance and reduce total
  giving. The project should consider whether the marginal utility asymmetry
  justifies asset-favoring rules on act-consequentialist grounds or only on
  rule-consequentialist grounds.

  POSITION: Explores act vs. rule consequentialism tensions regarding
  demandingness.

@article{cullity2004moral,
  author = {Cullity, Garrett},
  title = {The Moral Demands of Affluence},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a sophisticated defense of moderate beneficence
  requirements against both Singer-style demanding consequentialism and libertarian
  minimalism. Cullity argues that while we have significant duties to help others,
  these duties are limited by the "life-project constraint"—the idea that morality
  cannot require abandoning our own valuable projects and relationships. He
  develops a complex account of when helping others would constitute an
  unacceptable sacrifice, attempting to navigate between demanding and lax
  positions while respecting both utilitarian and non-consequentialist intuitions.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's life-project constraint raises questions about different
  types of resources. Long-term projects often depend more on asset security
  (home ownership, retirement savings) than on current income. If protecting
  life projects justifies limiting giving obligations, this might justify treating
  assets differently from income. The marginal utility analysis could provide
  utilitarian grounds for Cullity's non-utilitarian constraint.

  POSITION: Moderate position balancing beneficence demands with personal
  prerogatives and life projects.

  author = {Robson, Geoffrey},
  title = {What We Owe the Global Poor: In Defense of a Moderate Principle of Sacrifice},
  journal = {International Journal of Applied Philosophy},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {27},
  number = {2},
  pages = {251--263},
  doi = {10.5840/IJAP2013121611},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends a moderate giving principle that requires significant but
  not maximally demanding sacrifice from affluent individuals. Robson argues that
  while Singer's principle is too demanding (requiring sacrifice up to the point
  of marginal utility), a minimal principle is insufficient. He proposes that we
  should give until helping others would require sacrificing something
  "substantially important" to us—more than mere preferences but less than
  everything of comparable value. This attempts to capture common-sense morality
  while acknowledging significant duties to the global poor.

  RELEVANCE: Robson's principle of "substantial importance" requires criteria for
  what makes a sacrifice substantial. The income vs. assets distinction could
  matter here: sacrificing retirement security (assets) might be "substantially
  important" even when the financial value equals income that would not be.
  Marginal utility differences could provide utilitarian grounds for this
  intuition, showing that asset sacrifice has different welfare impacts than
  income sacrifice.

  obligations.

@article{berkey2020utilitarianism,
  author = {Berkey, Brian},
  title = {Utilitarianism and Poverty},
  journal = {Oxford Handbook of Poverty},
  year = {2020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides a comprehensive overview of utilitarian approaches to
  poverty obligations, distinguishing unconditional obligations (which hold
  regardless of what others do) from conditional obligations (which depend on
  institutions or others' compliance). Berkey argues that much recent debate
  concerns whether utilitarian giving obligations are best understood as
  unconditional duties to maximize good or as conditional fair-share
  contributions. He notes that this distinction affects how demanding obligations
  are and how they interact with political and institutional duties.

  RELEVANCE: The unconditional vs. conditional distinction affects how income and
  assets should be treated. Unconditional maximizing duties would treat all
  resources identically (give from whichever source maximizes welfare).
  Conditional fair-share duties might differentiate based on social norms or
  institutional roles (e.g., income taxes vs. wealth taxes). The project should
  clarify which type of obligation it addresses.

  volume = {66},
  number = {264},
  pages = {661--664},
  doi = {10.1093/PQ/PQV090},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Review and critical analysis of Peter Singer's book advancing
  effective altruism. Timmerman examines Singer's argument that we should not only
  give to charity but give to the most effective charities (those that produce the
  most good per dollar). This extends Singer's original 1972 argument by adding
  optimization requirements. The effective altruism movement emphasizes measuring
  impact, considering opportunity costs, and treating cause-selection as a moral
  choice comparable to donation amounts.

  RELEVANCE: Effective altruism's focus on optimizing impact could support
  asset-based norms if liquidating assets and donating proceeds produces more good
  than donating equivalent amounts of income. However, the movement typically
  focuses on income pledges (e.g., "give 10% of income"). The project investigates
  whether this income focus is justified or whether marginal utility considerations
  favor asset-based approaches instead.

  and effectiveness measurement.

  volume = {51},
  number = {1},
  pages = {33--50},
  doi = {10.1007/S10790-016-9552-Y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grounds duties to aid in human rights rather than utilitarian
  beneficence, arguing that subsistence rights generate collective obligations
  that should be distributed fairly among duty-bearers. Igneski contends that
  rights-based approaches avoid demandingness problems that plague utilitarian
  accounts because rights claims can be limited by fair distribution principles.
  She develops an account of how collective duties translate into individual
  responsibilities without requiring each person to do everything possible to
  fulfill rights.

  RELEVANCE: While not strictly utilitarian, Igneski's fair-share approach to
  distributing collective duties could inform utilitarian frameworks. If fair
  shares are calculated based on capacity to contribute, the income vs. assets
  distinction matters for determining capacity. Asset-rich but income-poor
  individuals might have different fair shares than income-rich but asset-poor
  individuals, even with identical net worth.

  number = {3},
  pages = {695--709},
  doi = {10.1007/s10677-015-9665-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Garrett Cullity's concept of fairness as "appropriate
  impartiality" and argues that vagueness in this concept makes it vulnerable to
  self-serving bias. Newey draws on psychological research showing that when moral
  concepts are vague, people unconsciously interpret them in self-favoring ways.
  This threatens Cullity's attempt to use fairness to limit Singer's demanding
  conclusions—we may convince ourselves we're being fair while actually being
  self-serving.

  RELEVANCE: The self-serving bias problem applies to any attempt to define
  "surplus" resources or determine when giving would require "too much" sacrifice.
  If income vs. assets norms differ, people might self-servingly classify
  resources in whichever category demands less. The project should address whether
  marginal utility differences provide objective (non-self-serving) grounds for
  differential treatment or merely enable rationalization.

  number = {4},
  pages = {547--561},
  doi = {10.1007/S10790-017-9593-X},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reexamines Singer's claim that spatial distance is morally
  irrelevant to beneficence duties. While accepting that distance itself doesn't
  matter morally, Binder and Heilmann argue that distance correlates with
  epistemically relevant factors—we know more about local needs and can more
  reliably help nearby. This challenges Singer's implicit assumption that we can
  help distant strangers as effectively as those near us, potentially limiting the
  scope of demanding obligations.

  RELEVANCE: The epistemic dimension of effectiveness could affect income vs.
  assets considerations. We may have better information about our long-term needs
  (requiring asset protection) than about optimal charitable allocations. If
  epistemic uncertainty should moderate giving obligations, this might justify
  retaining assets for possible future needs even when current income suggests we
  could give more. However, this seems to favor caution rather than systematic
  asset preference.

  effectiveness assumptions.

  number = {1},
  pages = {126--138},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820811000410},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that consequentialist evaluation of charitable/ethical
  consumption should include indirect effects on other agents' behavior. Walton
  contends that purchasing Fair Trade goods, even if less directly effective than
  donating equivalent money to GiveWell-recommended charities, may be justified by
  indirect effects: encouraging others to also support Fair Trade, building
  social movements, changing norms. This suggests consequentialism should consider
  systemic and motivational effects beyond direct impact.

  RELEVANCE: Walton's indirect effects argument could apply to giving norms
  themselves. An asset-based norm might have better indirect effects than an
  income-based norm if it's more psychologically sustainable, generates less
  resistance, or builds stronger pro-giving cultural attitudes. The project should
  consider whether marginal utility differences justify asset-based norms directly
  (act consequentialism) or through indirect effects (rule consequentialism).

  number = {4},
  pages = {989--1004},
  doi = {10.1007/s13164-021-00600-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the psychological measurement of utilitarian moral
  judgment, arguing that "impartial beneficence" (one dimension of the Oxford
  Utilitarianism Scale) is not distinctively utilitarian. Mihailov contends that
  Kantian ethics equally supports all-encompassing impartial concern for others'
  welfare. This suggests that debates about utilitarian giving obligations may
  actually concern broader questions about the demands of impartial morality
  rather than specifically utilitarian commitments.

  RELEVANCE: If impartial beneficence is shared across ethical frameworks, the
  income vs. assets question may not depend on utilitarian calculations alone.
  Different frameworks might reach similar conclusions about asset-based norms for
  different reasons (e.g., Kantian respect for rational agency might protect
  asset-based security differently than utilitarian welfare calculations). The
  project should clarify whether its arguments depend on specifically utilitarian
  premises.

  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  year = {2022},
  doi = {10.1017/9781108582865},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive treatment of prioritarianism—the view that benefits
  to worse-off individuals matter more morally than equal benefits to better-off
  individuals. Arneson distinguishes prioritarianism from utilitarianism
  (impartial but non-weighted) and egalitarianism (focused on reducing inequality
  rather than maximizing weighted welfare). He argues that prioritarianism
  provides the best consequentialist framework for beneficence, avoiding both
  utilitarianism's indifference to distribution and egalitarianism's sometimes
  perverse implications.

  RELEVANCE: Prioritarianism affects how giving obligations are calculated. Under
  pure utilitarianism, we should give until marginal utility of retained income
  equals marginal utility of donated income (the point Singer identifies). Under
  prioritarianism, we should give more because benefits to worse-off recipients
  receive extra weight. This could affect income vs. assets differentially: if
  asset-based security has especially high priority-weighted value,
  prioritarianism might justify retaining assets while giving income.

  POSITION: Prioritarianism as alternative to both utilitarianism and
  egalitarianism for grounding beneficence.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental evidence that veil-of-ignorance reasoning (asking
  what principles we would choose not knowing our social position) promotes
  utilitarian/greater-good thinking. Huang et al. show that veil reasoning
  increases support for utilitarian choices in dilemmas, effective charity
  donation, and autonomous vehicle policies that minimize total harm. This
  suggests impartiality mechanisms can overcome psychological resistance to
  utilitarian conclusions, supporting Singer's argumentative strategy.

  RELEVANCE: The veil-of-ignorance approach could test intuitions about income vs.
  assets. Behind the veil, not knowing whether we'll be asset-rich or income-rich,
  what giving norms would we choose? If marginal utility differences are real,
  veil reasoning might favor asset-protecting norms. However, if differences are
  illusory or self-serving, veil reasoning might reveal that income and assets
  should be treated identically.

  volume = {10},
  number = {1},
  doi = {10.1038/s41598-020-70199-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study finding that lay people rarely make genuinely
  utilitarian (outcome-maximizing) decisions in allocation tasks. Instead, they
  prefer equality-based distributions and, when they do maximize outcomes, it's
  usually to minimize harm rather than maximize benefits. Crucially, outcome
  maximization is often partial (favoring in-groups) rather than impartial. This
  challenges assumptions that utilitarian reasoning is intuitive or that people
  actually reason as Singer's argument requires.

  RELEVANCE: If genuine impartial beneficence is psychologically rare or
  difficult, this affects the feasibility of different giving norms. An
  asset-based norm might be more sustainable if it aligns better with
  psychological tendencies (protecting one's own future security). Alternatively,
  if the problem is partiality rather than the form of obligation, income vs.
  assets distinctions won't solve motivational problems. The project should
  address psychological feasibility.
