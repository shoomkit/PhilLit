====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Effective altruism (EA) emerged in the 2010s as a philosophical movement
and practical framework for optimizing charitable giving. The movement
centers on using reason and evidence to do the most good, often employing
utilitarian calculation to prioritize interventions. Central institutions
like Giving What We Can operationalized EA principles through the 10%
income pledge, creating structured commitment mechanisms for donors.
MacAskill's "Doing Good Better" (2015) established EA's public identity,
emphasizing earning to give, cause prioritization, and evidence-based
charity selection. Recent developments include the rise of longtermism
(MacAskill's "What We Owe the Future," 2022; Greaves & MacAskill 2021),
which extends EA's temporal scope to prioritize far-future generations and
existential risk reduction. Critical scholarship has questioned EA's
ecumenicity (Lim 2019), its neglect of systemic injustice, its elitism
(McLaughlin 2025), and its connections to questionable ideologies (Gebru &
Torres 2024). The domain reveals tension between EA's universalist
aspirations and its specific focus on measurable, quantifiable interventions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses why EA norms emphasize income-based giving
(10% pledge) rather than asset-based commitments. EA's focus on income
appears partly pragmatic (easier to commit, monitor, and sustain) but also
reflects deeper philosophical commitments to consequentialist calculation,
personal agency in career choice (earning to give), and motivational
sustainability. The longtermist turn raises questions about whether giving
norms should prioritize present poverty relief versus far-future existential
risk mitigation.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Despite extensive literature on effective altruism's philosophy and practice,
there is surprisingly little explicit philosophical justification for why EA
institutions chose income over assets as the basis for giving commitments.
Most discussions treat the 10% income pledge as given rather than as a choice
requiring normative defense. The relationship between EA giving norms and
broader theories of distributive justice (beyond Singer's aid arguments)
remains underdeveloped.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare EA's institutionalized income-based norms with the philosophical
foundations in Domain 1 (Singer's arguments could justify either income or
asset-based obligations). Note how EA's emphasis on personal agency and career
choice (earning to give) creates structural bias toward income. Consider whether
longtermism's rise challenges or reinforces income-based giving frameworks.

@book{macaskill2015doing,
  author = {MacAskill, William},
  title = {Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference},
  year = {2015},
  publisher = {Guardian Faber Publishing},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces effective altruism to general audiences, arguing that charitable giving should be optimized through evidence and reason to maximize impact. Develops the case for earning to give (choosing high-income careers to donate more), cause prioritization (focusing on neglected, tractable problems), and using cost-effectiveness analysis to select charities. Presents the framework that would become institutionalized through organizations like Giving What We Can.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing EA's practical norms, including the emphasis on income-based giving commitments. The "earning to give" framework inherently privileges income over assets as the relevant measure for moral obligation. Essential for understanding why EA institutions structured pledges around income percentage rather than wealth percentage. MacAskill's framework treats current income as the primary locus of moral agency, which shapes subsequent norm design.

  POSITION: Foundational EA philosophy emphasizing consequentialist optimization and personal agency in career choice.

  author = {Singer, Peter},
  title = {The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically},
  year = {2015},
  journal = {Yale University Press},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends Singer's earlier arguments about obligations to aid (from "Famine, Affluence, and Morality") into the effective altruism framework. Argues that if we have obligations to prevent suffering, we must discharge those obligations in the most effective way possible. Provides philosophical grounding for EA's evidence-based approach and introduces the effective altruism movement to philosophical audiences.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges Singer's foundational philosophical work on aid obligations with the institutionalized EA movement. Important because Singer's original arguments in "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" could justify either income-based or asset-based obligations, yet his EA work implicitly adopts income-focused frameworks. This text helps explain how philosophical foundations translated into specific institutional forms.

  POSITION: Utilitarian foundation for effective altruism emphasizing obligation to optimize aid.

@book{macaskill2022what,
  author = {MacAskill, William},
  title = {What We Owe the Future},
  year = {2022},
  publisher = {Basic Books},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops longtermism as an extension of effective altruism, arguing that positively influencing the long-term future should be a key moral priority. Contends that the potential value of the far future (billions of future people over millions of years) vastly outweighs present concerns, implying we should prioritize existential risk reduction and trajectory changes over near-term poverty relief. Introduces concepts of lock-in, value drift, and moral importance of future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents a major evolution in EA thinking with direct implications for giving norms. If longtermism is correct, income-based pledges focused on global poverty may be misallocated; resources should instead flow to AI safety, biosecurity, and other existential risk work. The temporal extension challenges whether EA's institutionalized giving structures (designed for evaluable, near-term charities) remain appropriate. Raises questions about whether future-focused giving requires different commitment structures than income-based pledges.

  POSITION: Longtermist expansion of EA emphasizing far-future prioritization over near-term welfare.

@book{ord2020precipice,
  author = {Ord, Toby},
  title = {The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {Hachette Books},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that humanity faces unprecedented existential risks in the coming century, including engineered pandemics, artificial intelligence, and climate change. Contends that reducing existential risk should be a moral priority given the astronomical value of humanity's potential future. Provides quantitative estimates of extinction probabilities and argues for institutional responses to safeguard humanity's long-term trajectory.

  RELEVANCE: Complements MacAskill's longtermism with focus on specific existential risks. Relevant to the research project because Ord's framework suggests charitable resources should prioritize existential risk reduction over poverty relief, challenging the income-pledge model designed for near-term global health interventions. The emphasis on institutional and policy work (rather than individual donations) may also challenge income-based individual pledges as the optimal giving structure.

  POSITION: Existential risk focus within longtermist EA, emphasizing catastrophic risk reduction.

@article{greaves2021case,
  author = {Greaves, Hilary and MacAskill, William},
  title = {The case for strong longtermism},
  year = {2021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents the philosophical argument for "strong longtermism": in a wide range of decision situations, the option that is best for the long-term future is the option that is best overall. Argues this follows from plausible axiological claims about the moral importance of future people combined with empirical claims about our ability to predictably influence the far future. Distinguishes between axiological and deontic versions of longtermism.

  RELEVANCE: The most rigorous philosophical statement of longtermism's core thesis. Directly relevant because if strong longtermism is correct, EA's income-pledge model focused on GiveWell-recommended charities may be fundamentally misguided. The paper's focus on what is "best overall" rather than "what satisfies our obligations" also has implications for whether giving norms should be framed as duties (like pledges) or optimization targets.

  pages = {1--37},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1007/s11229-023-04153-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges longtermism on epistemic grounds, arguing that our ability to predict and influence the far future is so limited that longtermist recommendations are unjustified. Contends that uncertainty and cluelessness about long-term effects undermine confident claims that we should prioritize existential risk reduction over near-term welfare improvements. Examines whether simple decision-theoretic approaches can handle deep uncertainty about far-future effects.

  RELEVANCE: Represents major internal critique within EA/longtermism debate. Relevant to research project because epistemic challenges to longtermism strengthen the case for near-term, measurable interventions (where income-pledge model was designed). If we cannot reliably identify far-future impacts, income-based commitments to proven interventions (global health, poverty) may be more defensible than asset-based commitments to speculative longtermist causes.

  title = {Effectiveness and Ecumenicity},
  journal = {Journal of Moral Philosophy},
  volume = {16},
  number = {5},
  pages = {590--615},
  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1163/17455243-20180016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruism's claim to be ecumenical toward different moral views is inconsistent with its criticisms of charities that do not maximize measurable welfare. Contends that individuals with different moral commitments (e.g., special duties to compatriots, emphasis on rights rather than welfare) may justifiably support charities that EA dismisses as ineffective. EA's evidence-based framework privileges utilitarian maximization over other legitimate moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Key critique of EA's foundational assumptions with implications for giving norm design. If EA is not genuinely ecumenical, its income-pledge model embodies specifically utilitarian commitments rather than universally compelling moral requirements. This challenges whether EA-style giving norms should be presented as what "we" ought to do versus what utilitarians specifically should do. Relevant for assessing whether income-based norms have broader justification than asset-based alternatives.

  pages = {511--526},
  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.1017/S0892679416000484},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Identifies valuable lessons from effective altruism (emphasis on evidence, cost-effectiveness) while critiquing its limitations. Argues EA neglects questions of justice, rights, and systemic change in favor of individual optimization. Contends that EA's focus on measurable interventions creates blind spots regarding political and structural dimensions of global poverty.

  RELEVANCE: Important early critique highlighting what EA's income-pledge model neglects: questions of how wealth was acquired, systemic causes of poverty, and political obligations distinct from charitable aid. Relevant because the choice between income-based and asset-based norms may implicate different theories of justice (income reflects recent productive contribution; assets may reflect historical injustice). Rubenstein's critique suggests EA's giving norms are too narrow even if optimized within that frame.

  journal = {Ratio},
  volume = {38},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1111/rati.12449},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that longtermism's focus on existential risk leads to implausible and unattractive political positions. Critiques Toby Ord's "grand strategy" as antidemocratic and elitist, and William MacAskill's "political experimentalism" as crude libertarianism. Contends that longtermists are unaware of the radical political implications of their positions or how those positions depart from mainstream advocacy.

  RELEVANCE: Recent critical assessment of longtermism's political implications. Relevant because if longtermism entails antidemocratic elitism, this undermines the case for redirecting EA's income-based giving from poverty relief to longtermist causes. The political critique suggests EA's original income-pledge model (supporting democratic, accountable interventions like global health) may be preferable to longtermist alternatives that bypass democratic accountability.

  volume = {29},
  number = {4},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.5210/fm.v29i4.13636},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the movement to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) is motivated by a bundle of ideologies (Transhumanism, Extropianism, Singularitarianism, Cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, Longtermism - "TESCREAL") rooted in eugenics. Contends that effective altruism and longtermism, despite claims to benefit humanity, encode discriminatory attitudes and centralize power while using language of safety to evade accountability.

  RELEVANCE: Radical critique connecting EA/longtermism to problematic ideological traditions. Relevant because it questions the moral foundations of EA giving norms: if EA is entangled with eugenics and power centralization, the entire framework (including income-pledge structures) may be suspect regardless of its internal coherence. This critique suggests examining the political economy of who benefits from EA norms and institutions.

@article{singer2009life,
  author = {Singer, Peter},
  title = {The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty},
  year = {2009},
  publisher = {Random House},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the drowning child thought experiment from "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" to argue that affluent individuals have strong moral obligations to donate to effective poverty-relief charities. Provides a sliding scale of recommended giving percentages based on income, with higher earners expected to give proportionally more. Emphasizes that even modest sacrifices from the wealthy could prevent enormous suffering.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding EA's income-based giving norms. Singer's sliding scale explicitly ties obligations to income levels rather than wealth or assets. The book provides both philosophical argument and practical framework that would influence Giving What We Can's pledge structure. Important for seeing how philosophical foundations (aid obligations) translated into specific institutional forms (income-percentage commitments).

  POSITION: Utilitarian foundation for obligation-based charitable giving tied to income.

@article{macaskill2016when,
  author = {MacAskill, William},
  title = {When Should an Effective Altruist Donate?},
  year = {2016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the temporal question of when to donate within an EA framework. Considers whether to donate now or invest and donate later, examining factors like discount rates, learning value, movement building, and the trajectory of charitable opportunities. Argues against simple answers, suggesting the decision depends on specific empirical parameters and one's comparative advantage.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses practical questions about EA giving norms beyond the simple "10% of income" pledge. The temporal dimension (give now vs. later) interacts with the income vs. assets question: if you should invest and give later, this implies assets (investment principal) become morally relevant, not just current income. MacAskill's analysis suggests EA norms may be more complex than the income-pledge model captures.

  volume = {3},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1038/s44168-024-00110-8},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Empirically demonstrates that individuals who endorse longtermism beliefs show stronger climate change concern, support for pro-climate policies, and contributions to environmental causes. Argues that responsibility to distant future generations drives these associations, and that targeted interventions can increase this sense of responsibility. Presents longtermism as a motivational resource for addressing climate challenges.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence that longtermist beliefs motivate action, relevant for assessing whether longtermist giving norms can sustain long-term commitment. If longtermism enhances motivation, this bears on the research question: perhaps income-based pledges work because they align with EA's temporal framing, while asset-based norms might require different motivational structures. The emphasis on future generations may affect whether donors view income (ongoing contribution) or assets (inheritance/legacy) as more relevant.

@article{rulli2024effective,

  title = {Effective Altruists Need Not Be Pronatalist Longtermists},

  volume = {38},
  number = {1},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.5406/21520542.38.1.03},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the pronatalist implications of MacAskill's longtermism, arguing that effective altruists can reject the conclusion that we should maximize future population. Advances a "critical benefit theory" compatible with preventing harms to actual future generations without the intensive pronatalism that longtermism seems to require. Questions whether the value of creating happy people justifies longtermist priorities.

  RELEVANCE: Internal EA/longtermist debate about population ethics with implications for giving priorities. If longtermism does not require creating vast future populations, this affects what causes deserve funding (shifting from existential risk to quality of future lives). This debate matters for the research question because different temporal and population assumptions generate different giving targets, which may favor different pledge structures (income vs. assets).

  journal = {Australasian Journal of Philosophy},
  year = {2025},
  doi = {10.1080/00048402.2025.2521030},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the scope of longtermism may be narrower than longtermists assume. Identifies "scope-limiting factors" (probabilistic and decision-theoretic phenomena) that reduce the range of cases where longtermist recommendations apply. Uses case studies to show that swamping axiological strong longtermism has restricted, though perhaps nonempty, scope in human decision problems.

  RELEVANCE: Technical critique examining when longtermist reasoning actually applies. Relevant to research question because if longtermism has narrow scope, the case for maintaining EA's original income-pledge model (focused on near-term interventions) strengthens. Scope limitations suggest that for most donors, income-based commitments to proven interventions remain more defensible than redirecting to speculative longtermist causes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the "AI safety epistemic community" emerging from effective altruism, longtermism, and existential risk studies. Documents how this community sustains itself through mutually reinforcing knowledge production and community-building practices across online forums, forecasting, research, and prize competitions. Argues that understanding this epistemic culture is crucial for evaluating AI safety claims gaining influence in global AI discourse.

  RELEVANCE: Sociological analysis of how EA/longtermist ideas spread through institutional and community structures. Relevant because it shows how EA's giving norms are embedded in broader epistemic and social networks. The field-building analysis suggests that income-pledge structures may function as much for community identity and commitment as for maximizing impact. Understanding these social dimensions helps assess whether EA norms are justified on philosophical grounds or sustained by community dynamics.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1177/02632764241240662},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how Silicon Valley's embrace of longtermism connects deep time (geological timescales) and microtime (digital operations) to legitimize extractive technological practices. Argues that longtermism appeals to distant timescales to marginalize present injustices while tech industry operations extract deep-time resources (rare minerals) to build microtemporal systems that delimit possible futures.

  RELEVANCE: Critical analysis connecting longtermism to political economy of technology. Relevant because it questions whether longtermist giving priorities (AI safety, space colonization) serve genuine moral aims or legitimize Silicon Valley interests. This critique bears on the research question: if longtermism serves tech industry ideology, this undermines the case for redirecting EA giving from poverty relief to longtermist causes, suggesting income-pledge models focused on global health may be less ideologically compromised.

  journal = {The Monist},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1093/monist/onae003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents a challenge to longtermism using risk-averse decision theory. Argues that while standard expected utility maximization favors delaying extinction (to create good future), risk-averse approaches might favor hastening extinction (to avoid risk of terrible future). Contends that morality requires risk-averse decision rules, creating a reductio of longtermist recommendations. Presents as challenge to longtermism, not advocacy for extinction.

  RELEVANCE: Technical philosophical challenge to longtermism's core recommendations. Relevant to research question because if longtermism's conclusions depend on controversial decision-theoretic assumptions (expected utility vs. risk aversion), this weakens the case for longtermist giving priorities. The challenge suggests that EA's original income-pledge model (supporting proven interventions rather than speculative far-future work) may be more robust across different decision theories.
