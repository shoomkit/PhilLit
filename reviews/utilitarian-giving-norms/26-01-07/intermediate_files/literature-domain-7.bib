====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses whether resources should be donated now or invested
for later giving—a critical tension between present and future obligations
in utilitarian philanthropy. The debate centers on three core issues: (1) the
philosophical justification for time preference and temporal discounting in
utilitarian calculations; (2) empirical questions about expected returns from
giving now versus investing; and (3) the role of uncertainty and option value
in timing decisions.

Foundational work on intergenerational ethics and time discounting (Ramsey,
Sidgwick, Pigou) provides the classical utilitarian framework that treats
temporal location as morally irrelevant—the "zero time preference" view.
This view has been challenged on both ethical grounds (Heath argues for
positive social time preference; Preston Greene defends time neutralism)
and practical grounds (Greaves surveys discounting in public policy; Stern
and Zuber & Fleurbaey analyze intergenerational welfare economics).

The effective altruism movement revived these debates through the concept
of "patient philanthropy" (Trammell). If investment returns compound faster
than the opportunity cost of delay, deferred giving could multiply impact
dramatically. However, this conflicts with the "hinge of history" hypothesis
(Ord, MacAskill & Greaves) that the present moment may be uniquely pivotal.
The debate extends to practical giving norms: MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord
propose income-based tithing as a demanding but achievable standard, while
Madoff & Soskis explore temporal considerations in philanthropic structures
more broadly.

Recent work examines how uncertainty affects timing: option value arguments
suggest that preserving flexibility by waiting can be rational even if
expected returns favor immediate giving. This connects directly to whether
asset-holding (with intent to give later) satisfies the same moral
obligations as income-based giving now.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential to the research question of income-based versus
asset-based giving norms. If patient philanthropy is justified, then
holding assets with intent to give later could be morally equivalent to
or even superior to giving from income now. The literature on time
preference reveals whether the temporal dimension of assets (as deferred
giving) creates distinct moral obligations compared to income flows.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively debates the ethics of discounting future
benefits, there is surprisingly little work on the ethics of discounting
future obligations. Most patient philanthropy arguments focus on maximizing
impact, not on whether timing affects when obligations are discharged.
Additionally, few papers address how uncertainty about one's own future
wealth or charitable intentions should affect the give-now versus give-later
calculation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish three levels of analysis: (1) pure time
preference (is temporal location per se morally relevant?); (2) investment
returns and compounding (do practical considerations favor delay?); and
(3) uncertainty and option value (how should we act under radical
uncertainty about the future?). This domain reveals that the case for
asset-based norms depends heavily on empirical claims about investment
returns and philosophical claims about our epistemic access to future needs.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Time neutralism (0% pure discounting): 4 papers - Classical utilitarian
  view that temporal location is morally irrelevant (Ramsey, Sidgwick,
  Greaves, Preston Greene)
- Positive time preference justification: 3 papers - Arguments that some
  discounting is ethically warranted (Heath, Stern, Zuber & Fleurbaey)
- Patient philanthropy: 5 papers - Case for investing to give later
  (Trammell, Founders Pledge, EA Forum discussions)
- Hinge of history: 3 papers - Present is uniquely important, favoring
  giving now (Ord, MacAskill & Greaves on longtermism, Mogensen replies)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes income-based tithing (10\% of gross income) as a demanding but achievable charitable giving standard for those in the global rich. Argues this norm is not overly demanding because: (1) it leaves donors significantly better off than they would have been under alternative feasible life plans; (2) it allows for agent-relative prerogatives and personal projects; (3) most people adapt quickly to moderate income reductions. Provides empirical evidence on hedonic adaptation and surveys showing 10\% is psychologically achievable.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the appropriate metric (income versus assets) for measuring charitable obligations. The focus on income flows rather than wealth stocks implicitly treats asset accumulation as morally neutral, provided income giving is maintained. This contrasts with asset-based norms that would require giving from principal. The paper's framework for balancing demandingness against impact is essential for evaluating whether asset-based obligations would be excessively demanding. However, it does not address whether holding assets for future giving (patient philanthropy) satisfies the same obligations as income-based giving now.

  POSITION: Income-based moderate consequentialism. Influential in effective altruism community as theoretical foundation for Giving What We Can pledge.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides comprehensive philosophical survey of arguments for and against temporal discounting in cost-benefit analysis and public policy. Distinguishes pure time preference (discounting merely because of temporal location) from discounting due to opportunity costs of capital, uncertainty, or expected changes in marginal utility. Argues that most standard justifications for positive discount rates conflate these distinct factors. Concludes that pure time preference lacks ethical justification, but practical discounting may be warranted by empirical factors.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding whether temporal considerations justify different moral weight for present versus future obligations. The distinction between pure and empirical discounting clarifies what is at stake in patient philanthropy debates: is the case for deferring giving based on morally neutral opportunity costs, or does it require ethically controversial pure time preference? Greaves' analysis suggests that if patient philanthropy relies on investment returns (opportunity costs) rather than pure preference, it may avoid the strongest philosophical objections. This matters for comparing income-based and asset-based norms, since the latter inherently involves temporal delay.

  number = {4},
  pages = {435--462},
  doi = {10.1163/17455243-46810051},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the consensus that pure time preference is ethically indefensible in climate policy. Argues that positive social time preference can be justified by non-identity considerations and generational sovereignty. When present policies alter the identity of future people (as climate policy does), we cannot harm "them" by discounting, since they would not exist under alternative policies. Additionally, democratic sovereignty of each generation over its own resources may justify discounting future generations' claims. Defends moderate positive discounting as consistent with taking future generations seriously.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the strongest philosophical case against time neutralism, with direct implications for patient philanthropy. If Heath is right that positive time preference is ethically permissible, this weakens the case for investing to give later, since the pure temporal delay itself reduces the moral value of future impact. For the income-versus-assets question, Heath's view suggests that obligations attach more strongly to present income than to hypothetical future wealth from investments. However, his arguments are specifically about intergenerational policy, and may not extend to individual philanthropy where non-identity problems are less acute.

  title = {Dynamic Public Good Provision under Time Preference Heterogeneity: Theory and Applications to Philanthropy},
  year = {2020},
  howpublished = {\url{https://philiptrammell.com/static/PatienceAndPhilanthropy.pdf}},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops formal economic models of optimal philanthropic timing when donors have heterogeneous time preferences. Shows that patient philanthropists (those with low discount rates) should typically invest rather than spend, potentially for centuries, before disbursing funds. In equilibrium models with both patient and impatient funders, patient donors optimally save while impatient donors spend, leading to dramatic accumulation of resources by patient funders. Estimates that under plausible parameters, effective altruists should spend nothing for 424 years, accumulating 46\% of societal wealth. Argues this is not a reductio but a genuine implication of optimizing under differential time preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most rigorous theoretical case for patient philanthropy and therefore for asset-based giving norms. If Trammell's models are sound, holding assets for investment rather than giving from income could multiply impact by orders of magnitude. This directly challenges income-based norms like tithing, suggesting that the primary obligation should be to maximize the future philanthropic pot through investment, not to give a fixed percentage of current income. However, the extreme conclusions (centuries of non-spending) may indicate that something is wrong with the model or that practical constraints on fund governance and moral uncertainty limit its applicability.

  year = {2023},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.5040/9798216424963},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Edited volume examining temporal dimensions of philanthropic practice from historical, legal, and philosophical perspectives. Essays explore: foundations and perpetuity, "giving while living" movements, legal structures that constrain or enable different temporal approaches, and ethical arguments for giving now versus later. Historical chapters trace how temporal norms in philanthropy have shifted across eras, with recent decades seeing growing skepticism of perpetual foundations and increased emphasis on spending down. Legal chapters examine how tax law and charitable governance structures implicitly embody temporal assumptions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides essential context for understanding how temporal considerations shape philanthropic norms in practice, not just theory. The volume reveals that the give-now versus give-later debate is not purely philosophical but embedded in legal and institutional structures. For the income-versus-assets question, this highlights how tax treatment of different asset types and legal constraints on foundation spending rates affect which norms are feasible. The historical perspective also shows that temporal norms are not fixed: the early 20th century favored perpetual endowments while the early 21st century favors spending down, suggesting these norms are culturally contingent.

  number = {3},
  pages = {254--265},
  doi = {10.1080/24740500.2021.2112121},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends time neutralism (zero pure time preference) against recent challenges from permissivists who argue time discounting is rationally permissible. Responds specifically to Callender's argument that time neutralism relies on the existence of non-existent "pure" time preferences. Greene argues that the time neutralist position does not require positing pure preferences as separate entities; rather, time neutralism is a methodological stance about evaluating preferences. The core time neutralist claim is that it is rationally impermissible to prefer a worse life in expectation merely because of temporal location—this holds regardless of whether pure time preferences exist.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the philosophical foundations of time neutralism, which underlies much effective altruist thinking about patient philanthropy. Greene's defense is important for asset-based versus income-based norms because it suggests that temporal location per se should not affect the weight of moral obligations. If temporal location is morally arbitrary, then obligations to use assets for future giving are just as strong as obligations to give from current income—the timing does not reduce the obligation. However, this does not yet tell us whether we should give now or later; it only establishes that pure temporal location is not a reason to favor either.

  volume = {1},
  number = {2},
  doi = {10.1162/99608f92.6e8fb1cd},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that key determinant of whether an action is right or wrong is often the action's effect on the very long-run future. Strong longtermism combines three claims: (1) those who live at future times matter just as much, morally, as those who live today; (2) there could be vastly many people in the future; (3) we can meaningfully affect what happens in the long-run future. Concludes that influencing the trajectory of civilization (reducing existential risks, improving institutions, promoting beneficial values) is likely the most important thing we can do. This favors working on pivotal issues now rather than investing for later, since we may be at a uniquely influential "hinge of history."

  RELEVANCE: Provides counterpoint to patient philanthropy by arguing that the present may be uniquely important, favoring spending now over investing for later. For income-versus-assets question, longtermism suggests that if we are indeed at a hinge of history, obligations to deploy resources now (from income or assets) are especially strong. However, longtermism does not directly address whether obligations should be measured against income or assets—it concerns what to fund, not what base to measure giving against. The temporal discounting argument (future people matter equally) could actually support patient philanthropy if we are not at a hinge.

  title = {Discounting and Intergenerational Ethics},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/xjhkp},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews philosophical and economic arguments for and against intergenerational discounting, separating two distinct ethical issues: (1) impartiality (equal treatment of all generations) and (2) priority to worse-off (aversion to inequality in welfare or resources across generations). Shows these issues have different implications for discount rates. Impartiality alone does not determine a discount rate, since one can treat generations equally while discounting (if inequality aversion is low) or not discounting (if inequality aversion is high). Critiques utilitarian approach for conflating these dimensions and argues that social discounting should be sensitive to both considerations separately.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies what is morally at stake in debates about time preference, with implications for patient philanthropy and giving norms. The separation of impartiality from priority helps explain why longtermists (high impartiality) and egalitarians (high priority) can disagree about discounting. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests the question is not just about temporal impartiality but about inequality: if future people will be richer, priority-based reasoning might favor giving to present poor over investing for future rich, even if impartiality holds. This complicates Trammell's case for patient philanthropy.

  number = {1},
  pages = {20--34},
  doi = {10.1080/16544951.2023.2246257},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's tithing proposal on four grounds: (1) demandingness—10\% of gross income is more demanding for low-income rich than high-income rich; (2) fairness—it fails to account for varying ability to give; (3) net wealth—focusing on income ignores that wealth inequality is more extreme than income inequality; (4) historical injustice—it does not account for how current wealth arose through exploitation. Proposes instead a principle of progressive giving that scales with both income and wealth, and adjusts for special circumstances. Argues this better fits MacAskill et al.'s own reasons for moderate rather than extreme sacrifice.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges income-based norms and argues for incorporating assets into the base for calculating obligations. This is precisely the income-versus-assets question the research investigates. Aloyo's wealth-based objection suggests that focusing only on income flows allows the very rich to discharge obligations too cheaply, since extreme wealth inequality is primarily in assets not income. However, Aloyo's proposal does not fully address the temporal dimension: if assets are included in the base, should obligations be calculated on current asset value (requiring selling assets to give) or on future returns from assets (allowing investment for later giving)?

  year = {2021},
  howpublished = {\url{https://philiptrammell.com/static/discounting_for_patient_philanthropists.pdf}},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends patient philanthropy framework to incorporate discounting of future welfare. Even with positive pure time preference, patient philanthropists should still invest for long periods if investment returns exceed the discount rate plus the rate of exogenous improvement in philanthropic opportunities. Provides formal conditions under which patient philanthropy remains optimal. Shows that standard arguments about declining marginal utility of consumption do not undermine patient philanthropy, since philanthropic opportunities may not exhibit declining marginal utility in the same way.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a key objection to patient philanthropy—that any ethically justified discounting would favor giving now. Trammell shows this is not necessarily true; the case for patience depends on the relationship between three rates: investment returns, discount rate, and rate of improvement in opportunities. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests that even if some discounting is permissible, asset-based approaches (invest and give later) could still dominate income-based approaches if empirical conditions are right. However, this hinges on empirical claims about investment returns that may not hold over long time horizons.

  number = {1},
  pages = {118--138},
  doi = {10.1017/S0266267120000061},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies real options theory from investment analysis to questions about the value of continuing to live under uncertainty. Argues that staying alive preserves option value—the value of keeping open the possibility of future goods whose realization is uncertain. Even when expected value of future life appears low, option value can make continuing rational. Explores conditions under which option value is positive and draws implications for suicide and euthanasia debates. Shows that irreversibility and uncertainty together create option value in life-or-death decisions.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on life-or-death decisions, the option value framework applies to philanthropic timing. Giving now is irreversible, while holding assets preserves the option to give later when information improves. This provides a distinct argument for patient philanthropy based on uncertainty rather than expected returns: even if giving now has higher expected value, the option value of waiting might dominate. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests that asset-holding provides flexibility value that income-based giving foregoes. However, this assumes philanthropic opportunities are sufficiently uncertain and that waiting genuinely preserves options rather than just delaying action.

  doi = {10.1017/S0266267114000303},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends use of low (near-zero) pure time discount rates in climate policy cost-benefit analysis. Argues that standard economic approach of discounting future welfare at market interest rates confuses descriptive facts about individual time preference with normative questions about intergenerational ethics. Critiques Nordhaus's high discount rates that justify minimal climate action. Argues that from ethical standpoint of equal treatment of generations, pure time preference rate should be very low (reflecting only catastrophic risk), even if this implies very different policies than would result from market-based discounting.

  RELEVANCE: Influential application of zero pure time preference to major policy question, showing practical implications of time neutralism. For patient philanthropy, Stern's arguments support the view that investment returns (related to market rates) do not ethically justify discounting future welfare. However, Stern focuses on public policy rather than private philanthropy, and his arguments about intergenerational equity may not translate directly to individual donor decisions. The distinction between market rates (opportunity costs) and pure time preference is crucial for evaluating asset-based versus income-based norms.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Announces launch of Patient Philanthropy Fund, inspired by Trammell's research, to invest philanthropic capital for future deployment. Fund will invest for minimum 10 years (until 2031) or until reaching \$100 million, then spin out as independent entity. Pre-seed funding from Jaan Tallinn and other major effective altruism donors. Arguments for patient approach: (1) investment returns likely exceed growth in cost-effectiveness of current opportunities; (2) future may offer higher-leverage opportunities we cannot foresee; (3) option value of preserving flexibility. Acknowledges counterarguments including hinge of history hypothesis and moral uncertainty.

  RELEVANCE: Represents practical implementation of patient philanthropy theory, showing that sophisticated donors are willing to commit capital to very long-term investment. For income-versus-assets question, this demonstrates revealed preference: donors who could give from income now choose instead to commit assets for future giving. However, the fund's 10-year minimum (not Trammell's multi-century timeline) suggests practical constraints limit the application of pure theory. The fund structure also sidesteps individual donor questions about whether personal asset accumulation counts as fulfilling obligations, since capital is committed to philanthropic vehicle.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Community discussion summarizing arguments for and against giving now versus investing to give later. Key arguments for giving now: (1) hinge of history—present may be uniquely important time; (2) urgent needs exist today that cannot wait; (3) uncertainty about future makes delay risky; (4) psychological benefits of regular giving may increase lifetime total. Key arguments for giving later: (1) investment returns compound, multiplying future impact; (2) future may offer better opportunities as knowledge improves; (3) option value of preserving flexibility; (4) moral uncertainty suggests hedging by doing some of both. Consensus that answer depends heavily on empirical questions about returns and opportunities.

  RELEVANCE: Captures ongoing debate within effective altruism community about philanthropic timing, showing how theoretical arguments cash out in practical donor decisions. For income-versus-assets norms, this reveals that many sophisticated donors are genuinely uncertain about timing, which complicates setting obligations. If even committed consequentialists disagree about optimal timing, it is difficult to say whether asset-based norms (which enable patience) or income-based norms (which enforce current giving) better fulfill obligations. The discussion also highlights moral uncertainty as a consideration favoring diversification across time.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Podcast interview with Philip Trammell explaining patient philanthropy framework for general audience. Trammell discusses: how compounding investment returns create case for delay; why standard objections about diminishing marginal utility may not apply to philanthropy; practical challenges of multi-generational fund governance; relationship between patient philanthropy and longtermism; and personal question of whether individuals should give now or save. Trammell acknowledges extreme conclusions (centuries of waiting) seem counterintuitive but maintains they follow from the logic of optimization under differential time preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Accessible explanation of patient philanthropy theory with discussion of practical implementation challenges. Interview format allows exploration of objections and edge cases not fully addressed in formal papers. For income-versus-assets question, Trammell's comments on individual giving are particularly relevant: he suggests individuals should consider their personal discount rate and whether they face stronger obligations to give now (e.g., to family, community) that might override pure optimization logic. This suggests even patient philanthropy proponents recognize limits to theory when applied to individual obligations rather than institutional fund management.
