# Literature Review Plan: Utilitarian Giving Norms — Income vs. Asset-Based Obligations

## Research Idea Summary

This research investigates whether utilitarian obligations to charitable giving are better implemented through income-based norms (e.g., the Giving What We Can 10% pledge) or asset-based norms. The project argues that a systematic asymmetry exists between the marginal utility of income and assets: beyond security thresholds, additional assets contribute little to welfare while income remains tied to ongoing needs. The research explores whether asset-sensitive giving strategies are favored under expected-utility assumptions.

## Key Research Questions

1. What is the philosophical basis for utilitarian obligations to give to charity, and how demanding are these obligations?
2. How do existing philanthropic norms (e.g., Giving What We Can, effective altruism pledges) justify their income-based focus?
3. What does the economic and philosophical literature say about marginal utility differences between income and wealth/assets?
4. Are there normative arguments for asset-based vs. income-based redistribution that transfer to charitable giving contexts?
5. What empirical evidence exists on giving behavior across income and wealth distributions?
6. How do considerations of time-deferred giving and investment affect utilitarian calculations?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Utilitarian Obligations to Charity — Foundational Arguments

**Focus**: Core philosophical arguments establishing that utilitarianism generates obligations to give, including Singer's original argument and subsequent refinements.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the logical structure of Singer's famine relief argument?
- How do different forms of utilitarianism (act, rule, two-level) generate giving obligations?
- What role does impartiality play in grounding these obligations?
- How is "surplus" or "excess" resources defined in the utilitarian tradition?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "consequentialism," "the grounds of moral status," "world poverty"
- PhilPapers categories: Applied Ethics > Poverty and Aid; Normative Ethics > Consequentialism
- Key terms: ["utilitarian obligation charity", "Singer famine affluence morality", "impartial beneficence", "utilitarian philanthropy", "consequentialist giving"]
- Foundational papers: Singer (1972) "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"; Unger (1996) "Living High and Letting Die"
- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Establishes the theoretical foundation for any utilitarian giving norm. Understanding the core argument structure is necessary to assess whether income-based or asset-based implementations better satisfy the underlying normative demands.

### Domain 2: Demandingness Objections and Moderate Positions

**Focus**: The extensive literature on whether utilitarian giving demands are excessively stringent, and proposed moderate alternatives that preserve agent-relative prerogatives.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the main formulations of the demandingness objection?
- How have utilitarians responded (satisficing, scalar, indirect strategies)?
- What threshold-based approaches have been proposed?
- How do agent-relative permissions interact with giving obligations?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "demandingness objection," "consequentialism," "supererogation"
- PhilPapers: Normative Ethics > Demandingness
- Key terms: ["demandingness objection utilitarianism", "satisficing consequentialism", "moderate beneficence", "limits of obligation charity", "agent-relative prerogatives giving"]
- Key authors: Murphy (2000), Scheffler (1982), Cullity (2004), Hooker (2000)
- Expected papers: 15-20 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: The demandingness literature directly concerns what level of giving is required. Asset-based norms may be more demanding than income-based norms in aggregate; understanding demandingness responses helps assess which implementation is normatively defensible.

---

### Domain 3: Effective Altruism, Pledges, and Institutionalized Giving Norms

**Focus**: The philosophical foundations and practical structures of effective altruism, focusing on how organizations like Giving What We Can have operationalized giving norms.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the philosophical basis for the 10% income pledge?
- How do EA philosophers justify income-based rather than asset-based commitments?
- What role do motivational and epistemic considerations play in norm design?
- How is the relationship between giving and investing theorized in EA?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entry on "effective altruism"
- PhilPapers: Applied Ethics > Effective Altruism
- Key terms: ["effective altruism", "Giving What We Can", "philanthropy pledge", "earning to give", "cause prioritization", "longtermism giving"]
- Key authors: MacAskill, Ord, Singer (recent), Greaves
- Secondary: Search for GWWC research reports, 80,000 Hours analyses
- Expected papers: 10-15 key papers + grey literature

**Relevance to Project**: Directly addresses the target of critique. Understanding why EA norms emphasize income allows assessment of whether this emphasis is merely pragmatic or has deeper normative justification.

---

### Domain 4: Marginal Utility, Diminishing Returns, and Wealth Effects

**Focus**: Economic and philosophical literature on how utility varies with income vs. wealth, including work on diminishing marginal utility and the distinct functions of assets.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the empirical evidence for diminishing marginal utility of income?
- How does marginal utility of wealth differ from marginal utility of income?
- What roles do assets play beyond consumption (insurance, optionality, positional goods)?
- How do subjective well-being studies bear on income vs. wealth utility?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "well-being," "egalitarianism"; economics literature
- Cross-disciplinary: Behavioral economics, welfare economics, happiness studies
- Key terms: ["diminishing marginal utility income", "marginal utility wealth", "subjective well-being income", "Easterlin paradox", "positional goods", "precautionary savings utility"]
- Key authors: Layard, Kahneman, Deaton, Clark
- Expected papers: 15-20 papers (interdisciplinary)

**Relevance to Project**: Central to the research hypothesis. If assets systematically have lower marginal utility than income (beyond security thresholds), this supports asset-based giving norms.

---

### Domain 5: Distributive Justice — Income vs. Wealth Taxation

**Focus**: Normative arguments about whether redistribution should target income or wealth, including debates on wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, and capital vs. labor taxation.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the normative arguments for wealth taxation vs. income taxation?
- How do luck egalitarians treat inherited vs. earned resources?
- What role do asset-based taxes play in theories of distributive justice?
- How do libertarian and left-libertarian views differ on asset redistribution?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "distributive justice," "inheritance and bequest," "taxation ethics"
- PhilPapers: Political Philosophy > Distributive Justice; Applied Ethics > Tax Ethics
- Key terms: ["wealth tax philosophy", "inheritance tax justice", "capital taxation ethics", "earned vs unearned income", "luck egalitarianism assets"]
- Key authors: Murphy & Nagel, Piketty (philosophical interpretations), Van Parijs, Fleischer
- Expected papers: 12-18 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: While focused on taxation rather than voluntary giving, this literature provides normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets that can be adapted to the giving context.

---

### Domain 6: Empirical and Behavioral Research on Charitable Giving

**Focus**: Psychological, economic, and sociological research on actual giving behavior, including how wealth and income differentially predict giving.

**Key Questions**:
- How do giving rates vary by income vs. wealth levels?
- What psychological factors drive or inhibit giving from assets vs. income?
- How effective are different giving norms at motivating behavior?
- What do experimental studies show about commitment devices and pledges?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Psychology/economics journals, experimental philosophy
- Key terms: ["charitable giving behavior", "wealth and philanthropy", "income giving patterns", "experimental altruism", "commitment devices giving", "warm glow altruism"]
- Key databases: OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar for interdisciplinary work
- Key authors: Andreoni, Bekkers, List, Wiepking
- Expected papers: 12-18 papers

**Relevance to Project**: Provides empirical grounding for whether asset-based norms are psychologically feasible and whether theoretical arguments align with actual behavior patterns.

---

### Domain 7: Time Preference, Investment, and Deferred Giving

**Focus**: Literature on whether resources should be donated now vs. invested for later giving, including philosophical and economic arguments about temporal discounting.

**Key Questions**:
- What is the philosophical basis for patient philanthropy and deferred giving?
- How should time preference and discounting figure in utilitarian calculations?
- What are the expected returns of giving now vs. investing?
- How do uncertainty and option value affect the timing of giving?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entry on "time preference"; EA and longtermist literature
- Key terms: ["patient philanthropy", "giving now vs later", "philanthropic investment", "time discounting ethics", "option value charity", "longtermism philanthropy"]
- Key authors: Ord, Greaves, Trammell, Mogensen
- Expected papers: 8-12 papers

**Relevance to Project**: Assets represent potential deferred giving. Understanding the ethics of timing informs whether holding assets (with intent to give later) is morally equivalent to giving from income now.

## Coverage Rationale

These seven domains provide comprehensive coverage by addressing:

1. **Foundational theory** (Domains 1-2): The core utilitarian arguments and their limits
2. **Existing practice** (Domain 3): Current philanthropic norms and their justifications
3. **Economic foundations** (Domain 4): The marginal utility asymmetry central to the research hypothesis
4. **Parallel debates** (Domain 5): Analogous income vs. wealth arguments in distributive justice
5. **Empirical grounding** (Domains 6): Behavioral evidence on giving patterns
6. **Temporal dimension** (Domain 7): Investment and deferral considerations

The domains deliberately span philosophy, economics, and behavioral science, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of the research question.

## Expected Gaps

1. **Direct treatment of asset-based giving norms**: The literature likely addresses income-based pledges extensively but asset-sensitive alternatives minimally
2. **Explicit marginal utility comparisons**: Philosophical work may assume rather than argue for income/wealth utility differences
3. **Integration across domains**: Distributive justice taxation literature and charity ethics literature may not be in conversation
4. **Empirical studies on asset-based giving**: Most giving research may focus on income-giving relationships

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 7
- **Estimated papers**: 80-120 total
- **Key positions**:
  - Demanding utilitarianism (Singer, Unger)
  - Moderate/satisficing positions (Murphy, Cullity)
  - Effective altruist frameworks (MacAskill, Ord)
  - Egalitarian redistribution theories (Piketty, luck egalitarians)
  - Behavioral economics of giving (Andreoni, List)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational philosophical works**: Singer (1972), Unger (1996), Murphy (2000), Cullity (2004)
2. **EA-specific literature**: MacAskill, Ord, GWWC research
3. **Marginal utility evidence**: Layard, Kahneman/Deaton, happiness economics
4. **Recent developments (2019-2025)**: Longtermism debates, pandemic-era giving research, wealth inequality discussions
5. **Critical perspectives**: Objections to demanding utilitarianism, critiques of EA, skepticism about giving obligations

## Notes for Researchers

- **Use philosophy-research skill scripts extensively**: `search_sep.py` for foundational entries, `search_philpapers.py` for philosophy-specific papers, `s2_search.py` with `--field Philosophy` for broader academic search
- **Prioritize SEP for conceptual foundations**: Entries on consequentialism, demandingness, effective altruism, distributive justice, and well-being will provide authoritative overviews
- **Include recent papers**: Use `s2_search.py --year 2020-2025` and `search_arxiv.py --recent` to capture post-pandemic developments in giving ethics
- **Cross-disciplinary searches for Domains 4 and 6**: Use `search_openalex.py` for economics and psychology literature on marginal utility and giving behavior
- **Citation traversal**: For key papers (Singer 1972, Murphy 2000), use `s2_citations.py` to find influential responses and developments
- **Verify all citations**: Use `verify_paper.py` before including any paper in final bibliography
- **Track the critique**: Domain 2 (demandingness) and the critical perspectives priority ensure coverage of objections to utilitarian giving obligations
- **Note grey literature**: GWWC research, 80,000 Hours blog posts, and Open Philanthropy research may be relevant but require appropriate citation treatment
