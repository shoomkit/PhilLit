## Section 2: The Income-Asset Asymmetry

Utilitarian giving norms require understanding the marginal utility that different resource types provide to their holders. If income and assets generate utility through distinct mechanisms with different diminishing-return profiles, this asymmetry may ground normatively significant distinctions in giving obligations. This section examines empirical evidence on the marginal utility of income versus wealth, the security-based utility that assets provide, and parallel debates in distributive justice about differential treatment of income and wealth.

### 2.1 Marginal Utility of Income: Diminishing Returns

The diminishing marginal utility of income is well-established empirically, though its precise contours remain debated. Kahneman and Deaton (2010) distinguished two components of subjective well-being: emotional well-being (daily experienced affect) and life evaluation (overall life satisfaction). Their analysis of 450,000 U.S. respondents found that emotional well-being plateaus at approximately $75,000 annual income, while life evaluation continues rising logarithmically without satiation. This finding suggested a threshold beyond which additional income yields sharply diminished hedonic returns.

However, Killingsworth, Kahneman, and Mellers (2023) substantially revised this picture through joint reanalysis of conflicting datasets. They found that the flattening pattern exists only for the unhappiest 20 percent of the population; for most people, emotional well-being continues rising with log-income without a clear satiation point. The logarithmic relationship nonetheless implies significant diminishing returns: each doubling of income yields approximately equal incremental well-being. Acland and Greenberg (2023) quantify this through meta-analysis, estimating the elasticity of marginal utility of income at approximately 1.6, meaning that doubling income reduces marginal utility by roughly 67 percent.

Social comparison and adaptation effects further complicate the income-utility relationship. Clark et al. (2019) emphasize that changes in income matter more than absolute levels for well-being, and that adaptation quickly erodes gains from income increases. The Easterlin paradox--that rising national income does not increase average happiness over time--suggests that relative position rather than absolute income drives much of the income-happiness correlation (Easterlin et al. 2010). These mechanisms imply that the marginal utility of income may be even lower than absolute well-being correlations suggest, strengthening the case for progressive giving norms.

Crucially, this evidence concerns income flows, not asset stocks. Whether wealth exhibits similar diminishing-return patterns through analogous or distinct mechanisms remains a separate empirical question.

### 2.2 Marginal Utility of Wealth: Distinct Mechanisms

Evidence suggests that wealth influences well-being through mechanisms partially distinct from income. Headey (2019), analyzing household panel data from Australia, Britain, and Germany, found that wealth has a stronger association with life satisfaction than income, even controlling for income levels. This finding directly challenges income-centric approaches to measuring capacity for charitable giving: if wealth matters more than income for well-being, wealth-holders may have either greater reason to protect their assets or greater capacity to give without comparable sacrifice.

D'Ambrosio, Jantti, and Lepinteur (2019) provide a decomposition showing that wealth provides distinct security benefits beyond consumption utility. Financial assets in particular correlate with reduced stress and greater life satisfaction independent of current income. Jantsch, Le Blanc, and Schmidt (2024) refine this picture by demonstrating that different asset classes have asymmetric effects: financial assets show stronger positive associations with well-being than real assets of equivalent value, while unsecured debt has particularly strong negative effects. This suggests that liquidity and optionality, not just total net worth, contribute to utility.

The work by Tay et al. (2016) on debt and subjective well-being reinforces that net wealth--assets minus liabilities--is crucial for utility, not gross holdings. Moving from negative to positive net worth produces larger well-being gains than equivalent increases at higher wealth levels. This asymmetry suggests a threshold below which wealth provides high marginal utility (by establishing basic financial security) and above which marginal utility declines sharply.

### 2.3 Insurance, Security, and the Threshold Hypothesis

The distinct mechanisms through which wealth provides utility point toward what might be called a "threshold hypothesis": assets provide high marginal utility up to some security level, but low marginal utility beyond it. Several lines of evidence support this interpretation.

Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2013), examining how health affects the marginal utility of consumption, demonstrate that utility is state-dependent--the value of wealth varies with contingencies it might address. This supports viewing assets as providing utility through insurance and optionality rather than direct consumption. Kushlev, Dunn, and Lucas (2015) find that higher income reduces sadness but does not increase happiness, suggesting income primarily buffers against negative states rather than generating positive affect. If wealth serves a similar buffering function, its marginal utility should be high when exposure to downside risk is significant and low once adequate protection exists.

Wiepking and Breeze (2012) demonstrate that *subjective* perception of financial security matters more for giving behavior than objective resources. People who feel financially insecure give less even controlling for actual income and wealth. This finding suggests that the psychological utility of assets depends on perceived adequacy for security needs rather than absolute amounts. Burri (2020) frames this as the "option value" that wealth provides--maintaining flexibility for future contingencies that income-based giving would foreclose.

These considerations suggest a threshold model: assets below the security threshold provide high marginal utility (insurance against adverse states), while assets beyond this threshold contribute primarily positional or aspirational utility with sharply diminishing returns. If correct, this framework supports asset-based giving norms that exempt threshold holdings but require redistribution of excess. However, no paper in the empirical literature explicitly articulates or tests this threshold hypothesis for charitable giving contexts.

### 2.4 Distributive Justice Parallels: Taxing Income vs. Wealth

Philosophical debates about taxation provide normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets, though these assume coercive redistribution rather than voluntary giving. Halliday (2018) defends progressive inheritance taxation through a "Rignano scheme" where inherited wealth faces higher tax rates with each successive generation, preventing dynastic accumulation. This approach treats inherited assets as categorically different from earned income--a distinction potentially relevant to voluntary giving obligations if source affects the legitimacy of retention.

Murphy and Nagel (2002) take a more radical position, arguing that pre-tax property rights are a "myth": property is conventionally defined by legal systems including taxation, so there is no natural baseline from which redistribution represents a taking. If correct, this dissolves any principled distinction between income and assets--all resources are equally available for redistribution. However, their focus on legal property rights may not directly translate to moral obligations of voluntary giving.

Practical objections challenge asset-based approaches. Delmotte and Cowen (2022) argue that capital assets lack determinate values except at realization points, making wealth taxation "arbitrary and unfair" due to dynamic and subjective valuation. This epistemological concern applies equally to voluntary giving: individuals may face severe informational barriers in assessing their true wealth for giving purposes, potentially favoring income-based norms on implementability grounds.

Yet even from libertarian perspectives, differential treatment of assets may be justified. Fleischer (2022) argues that inheritance taxation is compatible with--even required by--classical liberal principles, since heirs benefit from state protection of their inheritance and should pay for that benefit. If taxation of inherited wealth can be justified on libertarian grounds, voluntary giving obligations might apply even more strongly to unearned advantages that individuals themselves recognize as morally arbitrary.

These debates provide conceptual resources for distinguishing income from wealth in giving obligations, but assume coercive redistribution. Adapting these frameworks to voluntary charitable giving requires additional normative work: the state's legitimate authority to tax does not directly establish individuals' moral obligations to give, and the psychological dynamics of voluntary versus compelled giving differ significantly.

### Section Summary

Empirical evidence establishes diminishing marginal utility for both income and wealth, with the relationship more complex than simple satiation models suggest. Wealth appears to influence well-being through distinct security-based mechanisms, with financial assets providing utility through insurance and optionality beyond consumption value. A plausible "threshold hypothesis" emerges: assets below a security level provide high marginal utility, while excess assets contribute mainly positional utility with sharply diminishing returns. This asymmetry potentially supports asset-based giving norms that protect threshold holdings while requiring redistribution of excess wealth. However, no existing literature directly articulates this threshold model for charitable giving contexts, and practical implementation faces epistemological challenges around asset valuation that income-based approaches avoid.
