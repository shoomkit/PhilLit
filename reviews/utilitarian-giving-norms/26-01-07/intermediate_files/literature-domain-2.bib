====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The demandingness objection to consequentialism argues that requiring agents
to always maximize the good is unreasonably stringent. This domain contains
responses from both consequentialists and non-consequentialists. Key debates
include: (1) whether demandingness is genuinely problematic or reflects
misguided intuitions; (2) satisficing vs. maximizing requirements; (3)
agent-relative prerogatives that allow agents to prioritize their own
projects; (4) Murphy's cooperative principle limiting obligations based on
fair share of collective action; (5) scalar consequentialism abandoning
deontic categories entirely; (6) threshold-based approaches specifying how
much sacrifice is too much. Major works include Scheffler (1982) on
agent-centered prerogatives, Kagan (1989) defending stringent demands,
Murphy (2000) on the cooperative principle, Cullity (2004) on iterative
reasoning, and recent work on institutional and scalar responses.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether asset-based vs. income-based giving
norms can be normatively defensible if they prove more demanding in
aggregate. Understanding moderate positions (Murphy's cooperative principle,
satisficing, threshold approaches) helps assess which implementation is more
defensible while maintaining utilitarian commitments. The iterative reasoning
problem (Cullity) is especially relevant if asset-based norms create ongoing
demands.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work specifically applying demandingness frameworks to comparative
analysis of different giving implementations (income vs. assets). Most
literature focuses on global poverty in abstract terms rather than
institutional design. Recent institutional consequentialism (Miklos & Tanyi)
under-explored for charitable giving norms.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare Murphy's cooperative principle with satisficing and threshold
approaches. Consider whether asset-based norms violate cooperative fairness
differently than income-based norms. Examine whether scalar approaches
(Norcross) offer resources for comparing implementations without deontic
threshold problems.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Stringent demands (Kagan, Singer): 8 papers - Demandingness not a genuine objection
- Moderate consequentialism (Murphy, Cullity): 4 papers - Cooperation-based or iterative limits
- Agent-relative prerogatives (Scheffler): 3 papers - Non-consequentialist permissions
- Satisficing/Scalar (Slote, Norcross): 3 papers - Alternatives to maximization

  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/0198235119.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces agent-centered prerogatives allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own projects and interests without violating morality. Argues that consequentialism's demand to maximize impartial good fails to respect the independence of the personal point of view. Proposes a hybrid theory incorporating both consequentialist and deontological elements, where agents have permission (but not requirement) to favor their own concerns up to a certain degree.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding moderate positions that limit utilitarian demands. If agent-relative prerogatives are defensible, both income and asset-based norms must respect agents' ability to pursue personal projects. The question becomes which implementation better balances personal prerogatives against beneficence obligations, and whether asset liquidation demands respect or violate such prerogatives more severely than income sacrifice.

  POSITION: Agent-centered deontology with consequentialist elements; rejects pure maximizing consequentialism while retaining concern for outcomes.

  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/0198239165.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends maximizing consequentialism against demandingness objections, arguing that there are no principled limits on moral demands. Challenges both agent-centered constraints and agent-centered options/prerogatives, contending that arguments for moderate morality rest on confused appeals to personal cost. Argues that the stringency of morality is not genuinely objectionable; what seems demanding is simply what morality requires.

  RELEVANCE: Represents the strongest defense of stringent utilitarian demands, directly relevant to assessing whether asset-based norms are excessively demanding. If Kagan is correct that demandingness objections are misguided, then the mere fact that asset-based norms demand more aggregate sacrifice than income-based norms does not count against them. However, if moderate positions are defensible, aggregate demandingness becomes a legitimate normative concern for implementation design.

  POSITION: Maximizing act-consequentialism; rejects agent-relative prerogatives and constraints as lacking principled justification.

  title = {Moral Demands in Nonideal Theory},
  year = {2000},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {New York},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780195079760.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes the Cooperative Principle: under conditions of partial compliance, agents are required to do only their fair share of the optimific collective action, not to compensate for others' failures. Argues this avoids extreme demands without abandoning consequentialism's fundamental insights. Distinguishes ideal theory (full compliance) from nonideal theory (partial compliance) and contends that most demandingness objections mistakenly apply ideal theory standards to nonideal conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to comparing income vs. asset-based giving norms. If most affluent people don't comply with giving obligations, Murphy's principle limits individual obligations to fair share contributions. The question becomes whether fair shares should be calculated based on income or assets, and whether asset-based norms require excessive individual sacrifice to compensate for collective failures. The cooperative framework may support income-based norms if asset liquidation demands exceed fair shares.

  POSITION: Moderate consequentialism grounded in fairness considerations under partial compliance; limits demands without abandoning consequentialist foundations.

  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the Life-Saving Analogy problem: if you ought to save one person at small cost, iterative reasoning suggests you ought to give until impoverished. Argues this reasoning is fallacious because beneficence obligations are sensitive to the presence of competing claims from other potential beneficiaries. Develops an account of "appropriate impartiality" as fairness that limits demands without requiring full cost-benefit maximization. Distinguishes between directionless and directed beneficence.

  RELEVANCE: The iterative reasoning problem is crucial for assessing asset-based norms. If agents must liquidate assets to help others, and helping one person generates obligation to help the next, asset-based norms may create unsustainable iteration toward impoverishment. Cullity's solution via "appropriate impartiality" suggests limits based on fairness considerations rather than personal prerogatives alone. His framework helps assess whether asset liquidation demands respect or violate appropriate boundaries on beneficence iteration.

  POSITION: Moderate consequentialism limiting demands through fairness-based impartiality constraints; rejects both extreme demands and agent-centered prerogatives.

@book{mulgan2001demands,

  title = {The Demands of Consequentialism},
  year = {2001},
  publisher = {Clarendon Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198250937.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a "realm-based" consequentialism dividing moral life into distinct realms (subsistence, survival, sacrifice) governed by different principles. In subsistence realm, demands are moderate; in survival realm where basic needs are threatened, demands become more stringent; in sacrifice realm, supererogatory acts are encouraged but not required. Rejects both Scheffler's hybrid theory and Slote's satisficing consequentialism as inadequate solutions to demandingness.

  RELEVANCE: The realm-based approach offers a framework for assessing whether asset liquidation crosses boundaries between moral realms. Income-based norms might remain in subsistence realm, while asset-based norms requiring liquidation could enter sacrifice realm. Mulgan's framework suggests different moral principles apply in different contexts, potentially supporting income-based norms if asset demands exceed subsistence realm boundaries. However, the division between realms may seem arbitrary.

  POSITION: Moderate consequentialism with realm-based differentiation; rejects both stringent maximization and agent-relative prerogatives.

  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Early articulation of the cooperative principle argument. Challenges the standard consequentialist requirement to make up for others' failures to contribute their share to optimal outcomes. Argues that in conditions of partial compliance, beneficence demands should be limited to one's fair share of collective optimific action. Criticizes Singer's drowning child analogy as misleading because it assumes sole responsibility rather than shared obligation context.

  RELEVANCE: This seminal article provides the theoretical foundation for limiting giving demands based on fairness considerations. Directly relevant to comparing income vs. asset-based implementations: if most people don't give from assets, should compliant individuals liquidate assets to compensate? Murphy's framework suggests not, supporting income-based norms as potentially less demanding of individual agents compensating for collective failures.

@article{sobel2007impotence,
  author = {Sobel, David},
  title = {The Impotence of the Demandingness Objection},
  journal = {Philosopher's Imprint},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the demandingness objection cannot provide independent grounds for rejecting consequentialism because it presupposes prior commitments to non-consequentialist values. The objection's force depends on antecedent beliefs about agent-relative prerogatives or personal cost thresholds that consequentialism rejects. Thus the objection begs the question against consequentialism rather than providing neutral grounds for its rejection.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges whether aggregate demandingness provides genuine grounds for preferring income-based over asset-based norms from within utilitarian framework. If Sobel is correct, the mere fact that asset-based norms are more demanding cannot ground a utilitarian argument against them; demandingness concerns must be independently justified. This suggests focusing on other considerations (efficiency, compliance, collective action) rather than demandingness per se when comparing implementations.

  POSITION: Defends consequentialism against demandingness objections; argues objection lacks independent force.

  number = {266},
  pages = {84--105},
  doi = {10.1093/pq/pqw020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides systematic overview of demandingness objections, distinguishing between objections based on costs to agents, conflicts with personal projects, integrity concerns, and alienation from ground projects. Examines whether demandingness objections presuppose problematic prioritization of costs to the well-off over costs to the poor. Assesses various consequentialist responses including satisficing, scalar approaches, and indirect strategies.

  RELEVANCE: Offers comprehensive taxonomy of demandingness concerns relevant to comparing giving implementations. Asset-based norms may raise distinct demandingness worries: not just aggregate cost but also integrity/alienation concerns if requiring liquidation of meaningful assets. McElwee's framework helps identify which specific demandingness concerns are most pressing for each implementation and whether they involve problematic bias toward affluent interests.

  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190905323.013.13},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Traces development of demandingness objection as reaction to impartial act-consequentialism's beneficence requirements toward strangers. Distinguishes demandingness from related objections (alienation, integrity, special relationships). Argues rule consequentialism offers superior response to demandingness than act-consequentialist strategies, since internalized rules can limit demands while maintaining consequentialist foundations.

  RELEVANCE: Rule consequentialism may support different giving norms than act consequentialism. If internalized income-based norms produce better overall consequences than internalized asset-based norms (due to compliance, psychological effects, social coordination), rule consequentialism favors income-based implementation even if asset-based would be superior in individual cases. Hooker's framework suggests focusing on rules people can realistically internalize and follow.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  pages = {14--47},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198844990.003.0002},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends scalar consequentialism which abandons deontic categories (right/wrong, obligatory/supererogatory) in favor of purely comparative rankings of actions by their consequences. Actions are simply better or worse than alternatives, providing stronger or weaker reasons. This avoids arbitrary threshold-setting problems that plague both maximizing and satisficing approaches, and eliminates demandingness objections that presuppose deontic distinctions.

  RELEVANCE: Scalar approach potentially dissolves the question of whether asset-based norms are "too demanding" by rejecting the obligatory/supererogatory distinction entirely. Instead of asking which norm is obligatory, scalar framework asks which norm provides stronger reasons relative to alternatives. This may support nuanced comparison: asset-based norms provide stronger reasons when assets are easily liquid, weaker reasons when liquidation is costly. Avoids problematic threshold-setting.

  POSITION: Scalar consequentialism; rejects deontic categories at fundamental level while allowing pragmatic use at application level.

  number = {2},
  pages = {97--108},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820806001877},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues satisficing consequentialism is unacceptable because all versions permit "gratuitous prevention of goodness"—bringing about suboptimal outcomes to prevent better outcomes from obtaining. Shows this problem afflicts both simple threshold satisficing and more sophisticated effort-based versions. Concludes satisficing fails to solve demandingness problem while introducing worse problems.

  RELEVANCE: If satisficing approaches are flawed as Bradley argues, this eliminates one potential moderate position for defending income-based norms against more demanding asset-based norms. Cannot appeal to "income-based norms are good enough" if satisficing is incoherent. This pushes toward either accepting stringent asset-based demands (if maximizing) or finding alternative moderate positions (Murphy's cooperation, Cullity's iteration limits, or scalar approaches).

  volume = {51},
  number = {4},
  pages = {735--754},
  doi = {10.1111/nous.12213},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes novel "willpower satisficing" view requiring agents to produce as much good as they can given their actual level of effort expenditure, with an effort ceiling limiting required willpower. Argues this avoids Bradley's objection about gratuitous prevention of goodness while still reducing demandingness. The effort threshold is specified via independent theory of blameworthiness rather than arbitrary stipulation.

  RELEVANCE: Willpower framework may distinguish income vs. asset-based norms based on differential effort costs. If asset liquidation requires substantially more willpower/effort than income donation (due to psychological attachment, transaction costs, irreversibility), willpower satisficing might support income-based norms as appropriately demanding given realistic effort constraints. However, this depends on empirical claims about relative effort costs of different giving implementations.

  volume = {40},
  pages = {111--131},
  doi = {10.1007/s12136-024-00595-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops institutional consequentialism as response to demandingness objection. Argues institutions should bear the consequentialist burden of maximizing good, while individuals are required primarily to establish and maintain appropriate institutions. In special occasions where institutions fail, individuals face more stringent demands, but normal circumstances involve moderate institution-supporting obligations rather than constant maximization.

  RELEVANCE: Suggests giving norms should be institutionalized rather than imposed on individuals directly. Both income-based and asset-based norms could be implemented through tax policy, charitable deduction structures, or wealth tax institutions. Institutional approach may support income-based norms if income taxation is more feasible institutionally than asset taxation, or support asset-based norms if wealth taxation better achieves collective goals. Shifts focus from individual demands to institutional design.

  number = {1},
  pages = {1--23},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1468-0068.2010.00777.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "weak anti-rationalism"—the view that moral requirements need not provide overriding reasons for action—as response to demandingness. Argues that even if morality demands significant sacrifice, this doesn't entail that agents have decisive reason to comply. Distinguishes normative authority of moral requirements from their rational force, allowing morality to be demanding without being rationally tyrannical.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative framework for assessing demandingness: even if asset-based norms demand more than income-based norms, this may not generate stronger all-things-considered reasons for action. Allows utilitarian defense of stringent norms while acknowledging their demands may sometimes be outweighed by other considerations. However, this meta-ethical move may seem to undermine moral requirements' practical significance for guiding behavior.

  volume = {44},
  number = {2},
  pages = {169--191},
  doi = {10.1111/josp.12018},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues demandingness intuitions are unreliable because they're influenced by self-serving bias, status quo bias, and salience effects. Empirical evidence suggests people's judgments about what's too demanding are systematically distorted by motivated reasoning and cognitive biases favoring their current behavior. Therefore demandingness intuitions should not be given significant weight in moral theorizing.

  RELEVANCE: If demandingness intuitions are unreliable, this undermines objections to asset-based norms based on their seeming excessively demanding. People may judge asset liquidation as too demanding due to bias toward protecting their own wealth rather than legitimate moral concerns. However, this empirical debunking strategy cuts both ways: compliance and feasibility considerations for implementation may still favor less demanding income-based norms even if demandingness intuitions per se are unreliable.

  POSITION: Empirical debunking of demandingness intuitions; defends consequentialism against objection.

  pages = {1--27},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199662951.003.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "moving band" approach to agent-relative permissions, where the stringency of obligations varies with how much good is at stake. When small amounts of good are achievable, agents have wide permissions to prioritize personal concerns; when large amounts of good are at stake, permissions narrow and obligations become more stringent. This creates a variable threshold rather than fixed agent-relative prerogative or constant maximization requirement.

  RELEVANCE: Moving band approach suggests obligations to give from assets vs. income should depend on amounts of good achievable. If asset-based giving produces significantly more good for beneficiaries, permissions narrow and asset obligations become more stringent. If incremental good from asset-based norms is modest, permissions remain wide and income-based norms suffice. This context-sensitive approach avoids both extreme demands and inadequate response, but requires empirical assessment of relative impact.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines effective altruism movement's relationship to consequentialism and demandingness. Argues most EA understandings imply consequentialism, though EA advocates often deny requiring maximization. Contends that claim to maximize good is not essential to consequentialism; what's essential is view that producing more good is always morally better. Argues standard demandingness objection misses target by focusing on maximization requirement rather than this core comparative claim.

  RELEVANCE: EA movement's practical implementation of utilitarian giving provides empirical test case for comparing income vs. asset-based norms. Most EA recommendations focus on income percentages (e.g., 10% pledge, Singer's graduated scale) rather than asset liquidation, suggesting income-based norms are more practically implemented. However, Lichtenberg's analysis shows this may reflect pragmatic concession rather than theoretical justification. Highlights gap between utilitarian theory and EA practice.

  number = {1},
  pages = {1--8},
  doi = {10.26556/jesp.v10i1.182},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that satisficing and scalar consequentialism are not genuinely less demanding than maximizing consequentialism because they maintain that agents have most reason to maximize the good. Even if these theories don't classify suboptimal acts as "wrong," they still judge agents morally criticizable for failing to maximize. Thus alternative consequentialist theories don't escape demandingness despite rejecting maximization requirement.

  RELEVANCE: If Case is correct that alternative consequentialist frameworks remain effectively as demanding as maximizing consequentialism, then neither satisficing nor scalar approaches provide theoretical resources for defending income-based norms as less demanding than asset-based norms. This pushes toward either accepting stringent asset-based demands or adopting non-consequentialist moderate positions (agent-relative prerogatives, Murphy's cooperation). Suggests demandingness problem is deeper than structure of consequentialist theory.
