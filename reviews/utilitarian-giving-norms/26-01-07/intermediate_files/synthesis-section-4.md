## Temporal Dimensions — Giving Now vs. Later

The debate over income-based versus asset-based giving norms gains a distinct temporal dimension when we consider whether resources should be deployed immediately or invested for future philanthropic impact. This section examines how ethical arguments about time preference, the emerging case for patient philanthropy, and behavioral realities of implementation interact to complicate the choice between giving from income now or accumulating assets for later disbursement.

### The Ethics of Time Discounting

The classical utilitarian tradition, following Ramsey and Sidgwick, holds that pure time preference—discounting future welfare merely because of its temporal location—lacks ethical justification. Greaves (2017) provides the most comprehensive survey of this position, distinguishing pure time preference from empirically grounded reasons for discounting such as opportunity costs of capital or uncertainty about future states. On this view, the temporal location of a benefit is morally arbitrary; a unit of welfare realized in fifty years matters as much as one realized today. Greene (2021) reinforces this time neutralist position, arguing that it constitutes a methodological stance about evaluating preferences rather than a metaphysical claim about the existence of "pure" preferences.

Against time neutralism, Heath (2017) offers the most sustained defense of positive social time preference. Drawing on non-identity considerations, he argues that present policies often alter which future people will exist, complicating claims that we "harm" future generations by discounting. Heath further appeals to generational sovereignty: each generation may have legitimate authority over its own resources, justifying some priority to present over future claims. Zuber and Fleurbaey (2021) add analytical clarity by separating two dimensions often conflated in discounting debates—impartiality across generations and priority to worse-off generations. Even if we grant temporal impartiality, priority-weighted approaches might favor present giving if future generations will be wealthier.

The implications for giving norms are direct but underexplored. If time neutralism holds, future giving from invested assets carries equal moral weight to present giving from income, undermining any intrinsic preference for income-based norms. If positive time preference is justified, obligations attach more strongly to present resources, favoring immediate income-based giving. Yet neither philosophical camp has explicitly applied these arguments to individual philanthropic obligations—the debate remains at the level of public policy and intergenerational justice.

### Patient Philanthropy and the Case for Asset-Based Giving

The case for deferring philanthropy finds its most rigorous articulation in Trammell's (2020) formal models of optimal timing under heterogeneous time preferences. Trammell demonstrates that patient philanthropists—those with low discount rates—should typically invest rather than spend, potentially for centuries, before disbursing funds. Under plausible parameters, his models suggest effective altruists should accumulate resources indefinitely until commanding a substantial fraction of societal wealth. The logic is straightforward: if investment returns exceed the rate at which philanthropic opportunities improve, compounding dominates.

This framework has moved from theory to practice. Founders Pledge (2021) launched a Patient Philanthropy Fund explicitly inspired by Trammell's research, committing capital to long-term investment before future deployment. Madoff and Soskis (2023) provide historical perspective, documenting how philanthropic norms have oscillated between perpetual endowments and spending-down mandates across eras—suggesting current preferences for immediate disbursement are culturally contingent rather than ethically fixed.

Yet patient philanthropy faces a significant counterargument: the "hinge of history" hypothesis. Greaves and MacAskill (2021) argue that the present may be uniquely pivotal for shaping long-run outcomes, particularly regarding existential risks and civilizational trajectory. If we are indeed at a hinge, the case for deploying resources now strengthens considerably, since waiting risks missing critical windows for influence.

A notable gap emerges in translating these institutional arguments to individual obligations. Patient philanthropy literature focuses on philanthropic funds and foundations, not individual donors. Whether a person's private asset accumulation—with intent to give later—fulfills or merely defers moral obligations remains unaddressed. This ambiguity is central to evaluating asset-based norms: if holding assets for future giving counts as fulfilling one's obligations, asset-based approaches may be less demanding than income-based tithing; if it counts as deferral, asset-holders face ongoing unfulfilled obligations.

### Behavioral and Implementation Challenges

Even if theoretical considerations favor asset-based giving, psychological and behavioral evidence suggests implementation faces significant barriers. Andreoni and Serra-Garcia (2016, 2017) document time-inconsistent charitable giving: donors exhibit present bias, being more generous about future commitments than present ones. This creates a gap between endorsed norms and actual behavior that commitment devices—such as pledges—can partially bridge. Their experiments show pledges increase giving by 20-30%, with effects concentrated among sophisticated time-inconsistent givers who recognize their own present bias.

Time inconsistency may pose greater problems for asset-based than income-based giving. Converting assets to donations requires active liquidation decisions that can be indefinitely postponed, while income-based giving can operate through automatic payroll deduction. Meer and Priday (2020) find that both income and wealth independently predict giving, but through different mechanisms—income through regular decision opportunities, wealth through major life events and estate planning. This suggests income provides more natural behavioral hooks for implementing giving norms.

Fiscal evidence reinforces implementation concerns. Ring and Thoresen (2025) exploit a Norwegian wealth tax shock to estimate effects on charitable giving, finding that a 1% wealth tax reduces giving by approximately 26%. While this reflects coerced rather than voluntary giving, it suggests that treating wealth as an obligatory base may face strong behavioral resistance, possibly due to liquidity constraints or psychological attachment to assets as security buffers.

The result is a theory-practice tension: time discounting debates remain unresolved, but patient philanthropy provides a coherent case for asset-based obligations grounded in investment returns rather than pure time preference. Yet behavioral evidence suggests income-based norms may be more psychologically implementable due to their alignment with regular decision-making and automatic commitment mechanisms. Whether asset-based norms can overcome these implementation barriers—perhaps through novel commitment devices or reframing strategies—remains an open empirical question with significant implications for norm design.
