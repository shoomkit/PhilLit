DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses empirical and experimental research on charitable giving behavior, with particular focus on how financial resources (income vs. wealth) predict giving. The literature reveals several major streams: (1) demographic and economic predictors of giving, especially the distinct roles of income and wealth; (2) psychological mechanisms driving donation behavior, notably Andreoni's "warm glow" theory alongside pure altruism; (3) experimental studies on commitment devices, pledges, and time-inconsistent giving; (4) tax policy effects and price elasticity of giving.

The Bekkers and Wiepking literature reviews establish that income and wealth have different relationships with giving, with wealth showing stronger associations at higher levels. Meer and Priday's work demonstrates that both income and wealth independently predict giving, but percentage of income given remains relatively flat across income distributions—challenging the common "U-shaped" narrative. The warm-glow literature (Andreoni and followers) shows that donors derive private utility from the act of giving itself, not just from the public good produced, which has important implications for crowding-out effects and tax policy. Recent work on time-inconsistent giving (Andreoni & Serra-Garcia) and pledges reveals that commitment devices can increase giving, though the mechanisms are complex and involve both self-control and social signaling.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the empirical feasibility of asset-based versus income-based giving norms. If wealth and income have different psychological relationships to giving behavior—for instance, if wealth-holders experience different warm-glow effects or face different psychological barriers—this would affect which norm is more psychologically sustainable. The experimental literature on commitment devices is especially relevant for understanding whether either type of norm could be effectively implemented.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very little research directly compares giving from liquid income versus illiquid assets, or examines how asset composition affects donation behavior. Most studies treat "wealth" as a composite variable without distinguishing between housing wealth, financial assets, and liquid savings. Additionally, experimental work on commitment devices has not been extended to long-term asset-based giving strategies.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Integration with philosophical domains should examine whether empirical patterns of giving align with or challenge utilitarian prescriptions. The warm-glow findings suggest that purely consequentialist arguments may be insufficient; psychological sustainability requires accounting for donors' intrinsic motivation. The wealth-income distinction in empirical data should inform debates about which baseline (income vs. assets) is more psychologically tractable.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Income/wealth predictors (8 papers): Separate effects of income and wealth on giving likelihood and amounts
- Warm-glow vs. pure altruism (5 papers): Psychological mechanisms and their policy implications
- Commitment devices and pledges (3 papers): Experimental evidence on time-inconsistent giving
- Tax policy and price effects (2 papers): Elasticity estimates and crowding-out

  title = {A Literature Review of Empirical Studies of Philanthropy: Eight Mechanisms That Drive Charitable Giving},
  journal = {Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly},

  doi = {10.1177/0899764010380927},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review identifies eight key mechanisms driving charitable giving: awareness of need, solicitation, costs and benefits, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values, and efficacy. The authors systematically review empirical evidence for each mechanism across hundreds of studies, finding that most giving is multiply determined by several mechanisms operating simultaneously.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the empirical landscape of giving predictors. Critical for understanding whether asset-based or income-based norms align with actual giving behavior. The finding that both income and wealth predict giving, but through different mechanisms and at different life stages, directly informs the feasibility of different normative baselines. The psychological benefits mechanism (warm glow) is especially relevant for understanding intrinsic motivation versus utilitarian calculation.

  POSITION: Foundational review establishing multi-mechanism framework. Challenges simplistic economic models assuming single motivations. Emphasizes that effective giving norms must account for multiple simultaneous drivers of behavior.

  number = {2},
  pages = {217--245},
  doi = {10.1332/204080512X649379},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Focuses specifically on demographic and economic predictors. Finds that income and wealth have distinct relationships with giving: income predicts giving likelihood across all levels, but wealth becomes a stronger predictor at higher levels. Wealth effects are particularly pronounced for planned giving and bequests. Gender and marital status interact with income/wealth effects.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the income vs. wealth distinction central to the research question. The finding that wealth matters more for certain types of giving (bequests, major gifts) suggests asset-based norms might be more relevant for high-net-worth individuals, while income norms might work better for broad-based giving. The differential effects across demographic groups inform questions about norm universality.

  POSITION: Empirical evidence for differentiated effects of income vs. wealth. Supports the view that giving norms should potentially differ based on resource type and donor characteristics rather than being universal.

  volume = {74},
  number = {3},
  pages = {655--687},
  doi = {10.1086/714998},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, finds that propensity to donate and amount given increase with household resources. However, the percentage of income given is relatively flat across the income distribution after accounting for outliers—contradicting the common claim that poor give higher percentages. Both income and wealth independently predict giving, with wealth effects being substantial. Extreme outlier households are characterized by specific demographic profiles.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the "U-shaped giving" narrative that poor and rich give more as percentages than middle class. This finding is crucial for evaluating whether percentage-based norms would burden different income groups differently. The independent effects of income and wealth suggest that asset-based norms capture additional capacity to give beyond what income-based norms would capture. Directly relevant to questions about which baseline is more equitable.

  POSITION: Empirical evidence against regressive giving patterns. Supports the feasibility of percentage-based norms across income distribution while showing wealth as an independent predictor, suggesting hybrid norms might be optimal.

  volume = {17},
  number = {1},
  pages = {13--24},
  doi = {10.1002/NVSM.415},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Demonstrates that subjective perception of financial resources affects giving independently of actual income and wealth. People who feel financially insecure give less, even controlling for objective financial situation. Subjective financial strain has a stronger negative effect on giving than objective measures like income or debt levels. This suggests psychological factors mediate the resource-giving relationship.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding psychological feasibility of giving norms. If subjective perceptions matter more than objective resources, then asset-based norms might face psychological resistance even when objectively affordable, because wealth feels less liquid and secure than income. Conversely, income-based norms might be more psychologically tractable because regular income feels more available for discretionary use. Highlights the importance of psychological framing in norm implementation.

  POSITION: Emphasizes psychological mediation between resources and behavior. Suggests that effective norms must address not just objective capacity but also subjective perceptions of affordability and security.

  title = {The Pledging Puzzle: How Can Revocable Promises Increase Charitable Giving?},
  journal = {Journal of Economic Behavior \& Organization},
  year = {2017},
  volume = {138},
  pages = {47--65},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jebo.2017.04.007},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the paradox that non-binding pledges increase giving even though they are revocable and unenforceable. Develops a theory of time-inconsistent altruism where people are present-biased regarding charitable giving (more altruistic about future giving than present). Pledges serve as commitment devices that allow present selves to constrain future selves. Experimental evidence shows pledges increase giving by 20-30%, with effects concentrated among sophisticated time-inconsistent givers.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to questions about implementing giving norms through pledge mechanisms. If people are time-inconsistent about giving, commitment devices like pledges can help implement either income-based or asset-based norms by allowing people to commit their future selves. However, the effectiveness depends on recognizing one's own time inconsistency. Asset-based pledges might be particularly effective since wealth is more stable and predictable than future income, reducing uncertainty about ability to fulfill the pledge.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence for commitment devices as implementation mechanisms. Shows that psychological sophistication about one's own time inconsistency is crucial. Suggests pledge-based norms could work for either income or assets, but with different psychological requirements.

  journal = {NBER Working Paper},
  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.3386/w22824},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the theory of time-inconsistent preferences to charitable giving. Shows that people exhibit present bias in giving decisions—preferring to delay donations and being more generous about future commitments than present ones. This creates a role for commitment devices. Distinguishes between naive and sophisticated time-inconsistent givers, with sophisticated givers being more responsive to commitment opportunities. Experimental evidence confirms these predictions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding why people fail to give as much as they intend, even when they endorse giving norms. Relevant for both income-based and asset-based norms, but potentially more important for asset-based norms since giving from assets requires active conversion decisions that can be easily postponed. Suggests that effective implementation of either type of norm requires addressing time inconsistency, potentially through automatic mechanisms or commitment devices.

  POSITION: Behavioral economics perspective showing gap between endorsed norms and actual behavior. Implies that philosophical arguments for giving norms are insufficient without mechanisms addressing psychological barriers like present bias.

  journal = {Management Science},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {70},
  number = {1},
  pages = {633--646},
  doi = {10.1287/mnsc.2023.4702},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Large-scale field experiment (180,000+ microlending clients in Kyrgyzstan) testing charitable giving by low-income population. Finds that matching incentives crowd in out-of-pocket donations among the poor (opposite of typical finding for wealthy populations). The poor are highly price-sensitive in giving decisions. Proximity to charitable project does not significantly affect giving, contrary to predictions.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that giving behavior differs systematically by income/wealth level, with the poor showing opposite responses to matching incentives compared to the rich. This suggests that optimal implementation of giving norms might differ by economic class. For asset-based norms, the high price sensitivity of low-income givers might be problematic since converting assets to donations has higher transaction costs than giving from income. Income-based norms might be more feasible for broad-based compliance across economic spectrum.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence for class-differentiated giving behavior. Challenges assumption that single norm design will work across income/wealth distributions. Suggests targeting and customization may be necessary.

  volume = {55},
  number = {2},
  pages = {996--1006},
  doi = {10.1111/ecin.12417},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study examining how warm glow varies with source of endowment (earned vs. windfall) and option to take from recipient. Finds that warm-glow giving is stronger when money is earned rather than windfall, and when there is an explicit option to take (making generosity more salient). This suggests giving utility depends on perceived deservingness and moral context, not just amount donated.

  RELEVANCE: Implications for income vs. asset-based norms: earned income might generate stronger warm glow than wealth appreciation (which feels more like windfall). This could make income-based norms psychologically easier to comply with because donors experience more intrinsic satisfaction. However, assets accumulated through saving (earned delayed consumption) might generate warm glow similar to earned income. The framing of giving norms matters for psychological sustainability.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence for context-dependence of warm glow. Challenges the view that warm glow is purely about amount given. Suggests norm design must consider how resource source affects intrinsic giving motivation.

  volume = {22},
  number = {2},
  pages = {385--407},
  doi = {10.1111/JPET.12393},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theoretical model incorporating trust in charitable institutions alongside ability-to-pay (income/wealth). Shows that low-income donors may contribute more than high-income donors when trust is high and ability-to-pay differences are explicitly recognized. Model provides foundation for "U-shaped" giving pattern based on social motivation rather than pure income effects. Distinguishes warm-glow, impact, and socially-motivated philanthropy.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights that giving behavior depends not just on resources but on institutional trust and social context. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that building trust in distribution mechanisms is as important as defining the resource baseline. Asset-based norms might face additional trust barriers since verifying wealth is harder than verifying income, creating monitoring challenges. The socially-motivated giving framework suggests norms work best when they are transparent and perceived as fair ability-to-pay standards.

  POSITION: Theoretical integration of trust and resources. Emphasizes institutional context for norm implementation. Suggests transparency and fairness perceptions are crucial for both income-based and asset-based approaches.

  volume = {107},
  number = {1},
  pages = {1--15},
  doi = {10.1162/rest_a_01562},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Norwegian administrative data and quasi-experimental wealth tax shock to estimate effects on charitable giving. Finds that 1% wealth tax reduces giving by 26%, inconsistent with the hypothesis that wealth taxes incentivize charitable giving to reduce future tax burdens. Also estimates moderate own-price elasticity of giving (-0.44) using income-tax deduction bunching. Religious giving shows larger elasticity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides rare evidence on wealth effects on giving using quasi-experimental design. The large negative effect of wealth taxation on giving suggests that asset-based giving norms might face strong behavioral resistance if implemented through taxation. However, the finding might reflect liquidity constraints rather than unwillingness to give from wealth. For voluntary norms (not tax-enforced), the implications are less clear. The moderate price elasticity suggests tax incentives have limited power to shape giving behavior, whether income-based or wealth-based.

  POSITION: Quasi-experimental evidence for wealth effects. Suggests asset-based approaches face implementation challenges if enforced through taxation, but voluntary asset-based norms might work differently. Highlights importance of distinguishing voluntary from coerced giving.

  volume = {40},
  number = {3},
  pages = {497--513},
  doi = {10.1093/esr/jcae009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how income inequality at regional level affects individual charitable giving in China. Finds no significant relationship between inequality and giving to high-redistributive causes (poverty alleviation), contrary to predictions. Higher education moderates this relationship slightly positively. Small negative association with giving to low-redistributive causes (arts, culture). Suggests contextual inequality does not automatically increase compensatory charitable behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether inequality context affects giving behavior—relevant for understanding whether utilitarian giving norms gain traction in unequal societies. The null finding for redistributive giving suggests that moral arguments about addressing inequality may not automatically translate into behavior. Implications for implementing income vs. asset-based norms: since wealth inequality is higher than income inequality, asset-based norms might face greater psychological resistance in contexts where inequality is salient and wealth concentration is visible.

  POSITION: Cross-sectional evidence on inequality and giving. Challenges assumption that inequality awareness automatically drives compensatory giving. Suggests norm implementation cannot rely on inequality salience alone.

  number = {Supplement 1},
  pages = {1093--1093},
  doi = {10.1093/geroni/igaf122.3883},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Survey of Consumer Finances and Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine wealth concentration and prosocial behavior by age. Finds that adults 55+ hold 73% of national wealth (up from 53% in 1989). Older adults donate more and donate larger amounts than younger adults, controlling for wealth, race, and marital status. Also volunteer more hours. Increased prosociality with age persists after controlling for wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that wealth concentration and giving propensity both increase with age, suggesting asset-based giving norms might be particularly relevant for older populations who hold most wealth. However, the age-prosociality relationship independent of wealth suggests intrinsic motivational changes with aging, not just increased capacity. For implementing asset-based norms, targeting older wealth-holders might be most effective, but raises intergenerational equity questions if burden falls disproportionately on elderly.

  POSITION: Large-sample evidence on age, wealth, and giving. Suggests life-stage differences matter for both resource availability and giving motivation. Implies norm implementation might need age-sensitive design.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Philanthropy Panel Study longitudinal data (2005-2017) with fixed effects to examine intrahousehold determinants of giving. Finds women's earned income disproportionately influences household giving decisions when fixed effects control for unobserved heterogeneity. Husband's and wife's unearned income initially predict giving, but only wife's earned income remains significant with fixed effects. Education matters less than income, and only when husband has more education than wife.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals that giving decisions are not unitary within households and earned income has different effects than unearned income (wealth). For implementing giving norms, this suggests household-level norms must account for whose resources are being committed and what type of resources. Asset-based norms might face additional intrahousehold negotiation costs since wealth is typically jointly held. Income-based norms on earned income might be easier to implement since they align with existing behavioral patterns where earners have agency over their earnings.

  POSITION: Panel data evidence for intrahousehold giving dynamics. Challenges unitary household assumption. Suggests norm implementation requires attention to household decision-making structure and resource control.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study using Comparative Dictator Game with low-income, predominantly African-American participants. Both participants and recipients are from same community. Finds higher giving to more "worthy" recipients (disabled, female heads of household, those with children) when donating to different recipients. When selecting single preferred recipient, participants trade off worthiness against self-interest (selecting those to whom they gave less, particularly those with children).

  RELEVANCE: Shows that perceived deservingness and self-interest both influence giving decisions, even among low-income populations. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that framing matters: norms emphasizing worthiness of recipients might generate more compliance than purely utilitarian arguments. Asset-based norms might be perceived as targeting the "unworthy wealthy" which could increase compliance, but might also trigger self-interest rationalizations. The trade-off between expressed values and actual choices highlights implementation challenges.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence on deservingness and self-interest. Shows gap between stated preferences and actual behavior. Emphasizes importance of framing and recipient characteristics for norm compliance.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how charitable giving responded to the Great Recession (2007-2009) when both income and wealth declined sharply. Finds that giving dropped significantly, with wealth shocks (especially housing wealth) having larger effects than income shocks. Recovery in giving lagged recovery in income and wealth. Different types of charities experienced different impacts, with human services seeing less decline than arts/culture.

  RELEVANCE: Provides natural experiment evidence on relative importance of income vs. wealth for giving. The larger effect of wealth shocks suggests that wealth-based giving might be more volatile and less stable than income-based giving during economic downturns. This volatility could be problematic for charitable organizations relying on donations, but also suggests wealth-holders have greater capacity to give during normal times. For norm implementation, this implies asset-based norms might need stabilizing mechanisms to handle economic shocks.

  POSITION: Natural experiment evidence on income vs. wealth shocks. Shows wealth effects dominate during crisis. Suggests asset-based giving is more pro-cyclical, creating stability concerns for norm implementation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and validates experimentally-tested survey module for measuring economic preferences including altruism, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, trust, risk-taking, and time preferences. Shows that survey measures correlate with incentivized experimental measures and predict real-world behaviors. Provides standardized tool for large-scale preference measurement. Applied in Global Preference Survey covering 80,000 individuals in 76 countries.

  RELEVANCE: Provides validated measurement tools for studying prosocial preferences relevant to charitable giving. The altruism and positive reciprocity measures are particularly relevant for predicting compliance with giving norms. The finding that preferences vary systematically across individuals and cultures suggests that universal giving norms (whether income-based or asset-based) may face variable compliance depending on preference distributions. However, preferences are measurable and predictable, enabling targeted norm implementation.

  POSITION: Methodological contribution for preference measurement. Shows preferences are measurable and predictive. Enables identification of heterogeneity in likely responses to different norm types.

  doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1870-21.2022},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: fMRI study examining how stress affects charitable giving. Finds that stress hormone cortisol is associated with reduced donations, but only in individuals with high mentalizing capacity (ability to infer others' mental states). Effect is mediated by reduced value representations in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Low mentalizers show no cortisol effect on giving. Suggests stress affects giving through impact on social cognition and value computation.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that giving behavior is sensitive to physiological stress state and individual cognitive capacities. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that compliance might vary with stress levels and cognitive resources. Asset-based giving might be particularly vulnerable to stress effects since it requires complex financial planning and perspective-taking about long-term consequences. Income-based norms operating through automatic mechanisms (payroll deduction) might be more robust to stress-related compliance failures.

  POSITION: Neuroscience evidence on stress and giving. Shows physiological and cognitive moderators of prosocial behavior. Highlights importance of implementation mechanisms that don't rely on sustained cognitive effort or stress-free decision-making.
