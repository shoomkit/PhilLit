====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain encompasses economic and philosophical literature on how utility
varies with income versus wealth. The fundamental question is whether the
marginal utility of income differs systematically from the marginal utility
of wealth, and whether this difference has normative implications for
resource allocation and charitable giving.

The literature establishes several key findings. First, the diminishing
marginal utility of income is well-documented empirically through subjective
well-being studies. Kahneman and Deaton's seminal 2010 study found that
emotional well-being plateaus around $75,000 annual income, though this
finding has been contested and refined by subsequent work (Killingsworth
et al. 2023). Second, wealth appears to have different utility characteristics
than income: Headey (2019) found that wealth influences life satisfaction
more than income in Australia, suggesting that wealth may provide utility
through channels beyond consumption - namely insurance, optionality, and
positional signaling. Third, the relationship between income/wealth and
happiness is complicated by social comparison effects, adaptation, and
cultural factors.

The Easterlin paradox - the observation that happiness does not increase
with long-term economic growth despite strong cross-sectional correlations
between income and happiness - remains contested but influential. Recent
work has attempted to reconcile this paradox by distinguishing between
different components of subjective well-being (affective vs. evaluative)
and by examining satiation points.

Key debates center on: (1) whether there is a satiation point for income's
effect on well-being and where it lies; (2) how wealth effects differ from
income effects; (3) the role of precautionary savings and insurance motives
in explaining wealth accumulation; (4) how positional goods and social
comparison affect the income-happiness relationship.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain is central to the research project's investigation of whether
utilitarian obligations to give should be based on income or assets. If
the marginal utility of wealth is lower than the marginal utility of income
(beyond a reasonable security threshold), then asset-based giving norms
may be morally superior to income-based norms. The empirical evidence on
diminishing marginal utility, precautionary savings motives, and the
wealth-happiness relationship provides the factual foundation for normative
arguments about optimal giving strategies.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

There is limited direct comparison of marginal utility of wealth versus
marginal utility of income. Most studies focus on one or the other. The
literature on precautionary savings provides indirect evidence about wealth's
diminishing marginal utility, but explicit empirical estimates comparing
the two are rare. Additionally, there is limited normative analysis
connecting these empirical findings to charitable giving obligations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesizers should distinguish between: (1) emotional well-being vs. life
evaluation measures; (2) absolute vs. relative income/wealth effects;
(3) different asset classes (financial vs. real assets, liquid vs. illiquid).
The contrast between income-based and wealth-based approaches to utility
should be emphasized, as this directly informs the normative question about
giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Income satiation hypothesis: 8 papers - Emotional well-being plateaus at
  moderate income levels ($75k-$90k)
- Wealth > Income for life satisfaction: 3 papers - Wealth has stronger
  effects on evaluative well-being than income
- Precautionary savings/insurance motives: 4 papers - Wealth provides
  utility through risk reduction beyond consumption
- Positional goods/social comparison: 3 papers - Relative position matters
  more than absolute levels for well-being

  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},
  year = {2010},

  pages = {16489--16493},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1011492107},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This seminal paper distinguishes between two aspects of
  subjective well-being: emotional well-being (daily happiness, stress,
  sadness) and life evaluation (overall life satisfaction). Using Gallup
  data on 450,000 US residents, the authors find that while life evaluation
  rises consistently with income, emotional well-being plateaus at
  approximately $75,000 annual income. Beyond this threshold, higher income
  buys life satisfaction but not happiness.

  RELEVANCE: This finding is crucial for understanding diminishing marginal
  utility of income. The satiation point for emotional well-being suggests
  that for individuals above $75k, additional income has sharply diminishing
  returns for experienced utility. This directly supports the argument that
  high-income individuals should give more, as their marginal utility of
  income is lower. However, the continued rise in life evaluation suggests
  income still provides some utility even at high levels, possibly through
  positional or aspirational channels.

  POSITION: Income satiation hypothesis. The dual-component model of
  well-being is foundational for understanding the income-happiness
  relationship.

  title = {Income and emotional well-being: A conflict resolved},
  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {120},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.2208661120},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper resolves the apparent contradiction between
  Kahneman-Deaton (2010) and Killingsworth (2021) regarding income
  satiation. Through joint reanalysis, the authors find that the flattening
  pattern exists but is restricted to the least happy 20% of the population.
  For most people, happiness continues to rise with log(income) without
  satiation. The discrepancy arose from methodological choices in data
  analysis that should be questioned more often.

  RELEVANCE: This significantly revises the income satiation thesis. If
  emotional well-being continues to rise with income for 80% of people
  (albeit logarithmically), then the case for sharply diminishing marginal
  utility of income is weaker than Kahneman-Deaton suggested. However, the
  logarithmic relationship still implies diminishing returns, and the
  finding that unhappy people experience satiation is important for
  understanding heterogeneity in utility functions.

  POSITION: Qualified satiation hypothesis. Challenges the universal
  satiation point but confirms logarithmic (diminishing) returns and
  satiation for unhappiest quintile.

  title = {Wealth Influences Life Satisfaction More Than Income: International Evidence},
  journal = {Journal of Happiness Studies},
  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1007/s10902-018-0034-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using household panel data from Australia, Britain, and
  Germany, this paper demonstrates that household wealth has a stronger
  association with life satisfaction than household income. The effect
  holds even after controlling for income and other standard variables.
  Wealth appears to provide security, options, and social status that
  contribute to well-being beyond what income provides through consumption.

  RELEVANCE: This is perhaps the most directly relevant paper for the
  project's central question. If wealth has stronger effects on life
  satisfaction than income, and if assets beyond a security threshold
  provide mainly positional or optional benefits (rather than consumption
  utility), this supports asset-based giving norms. The finding challenges
  income-centric approaches to both well-being measurement and charitable
  giving obligations.

  POSITION: Wealth > Income for life satisfaction. This is a key empirical
  foundation for distinguishing marginal utility of wealth from marginal
  utility of income.

  volume = {148},
  pages = {47--66},
  doi = {10.1007/s11205-019-02186-w},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive study examines the relationship between
  both income and wealth with subjective well-being across multiple European
  countries. The authors find that both income and wealth matter for
  happiness, but wealth plays a particularly important role in providing
  security and reducing financial stress. The effects vary by wealth
  component (financial assets, real estate, debt) and by individual
  characteristics.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides crucial evidence on how different
  components of wealth affect well-being. If financial assets have
  diminishing marginal utility while providing mainly insurance value, this
  strengthens the case for asset-based giving. The decomposition into
  wealth components helps identify which assets contribute most to utility
  and which are held primarily for positional or precautionary reasons.

  POSITION: Both income and wealth affect well-being, with wealth providing
  distinct security benefits. Supports multidimensional approach to
  financial well-being.

@article{easterlin2010happiness,
  author = {Easterlin, Richard A. and Angelescu, Laura and Switek, Malgorzata and Sawangfa, Onnicha and Zweig, Jacqueline},
  title = {The happiness-income paradox revisited},
  journal = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {107},
  pages = {22463--22468},
  doi = {10.1073/pnas.1015962107},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper revisits the Easterlin paradox - the observation
  that while richer people are happier than poorer people within countries,
  average happiness does not increase as countries grow richer over time.
  The authors confirm this pattern across 37 countries over recent decades,
  arguing that happiness depends on relative rather than absolute income.
  Adaptation and social comparison explain why rising incomes don't increase
  happiness in the long run.

  RELEVANCE: The Easterlin paradox has important implications for
  understanding diminishing marginal utility. If happiness depends largely
  on relative position, then redistribution could increase total utility
  even without changing absolute consumption levels. This supports
  progressive giving norms. However, if the paradox primarily reflects
  adaptation rather than social comparison, the implications for giving
  are less clear.

  POSITION: Relative income hypothesis. Foundational for understanding
  social comparison effects and adaptation in the income-happiness
  relationship.

@article{clark2012causes,
  author = {Clark, Andrew E. and Layard, Richard and Senik, Claudia},
  title = {The causes of happiness and misery},
  journal = {World Happiness Report},
  year = {2012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review examines the determinants of
  subjective well-being, with particular attention to income, unemployment,
  health, and social relationships. The authors synthesize extensive
  empirical evidence showing that income has significant but diminishing
  effects on happiness, and that unemployment and poor health have large
  negative effects. Social comparison and adaptation are key mechanisms
  mediating the income-happiness relationship.

  RELEVANCE: This review provides essential context for understanding how
  income affects well-being relative to other factors. The finding that
  income's effect is significant but smaller than health and social
  relationships suggests that focusing solely on financial resources may
  miss important dimensions of utility. For utilitarian giving norms, this
  raises questions about whether donations should target income/wealth
  transfer or other goods that more efficiently increase well-being.

  POSITION: Comprehensive multidimensional approach to well-being. Income
  is important but not uniquely determinative of happiness.

  title = {Income},
  journal = {The Origins of Happiness},
  year = {2019},
  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  doi = {10.2307/j.ctvd58t1t.6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This chapter examines the effect of income on happiness
  using longitudinal data from Britain, Germany, and Australia. While
  confirming that income affects happiness, the authors emphasize the
  importance of social comparisons and adaptation in mediating this
  relationship. They find that changes in income matter more than levels,
  and that the income-happiness gradient varies across individuals and
  contexts.

  RELEVANCE: The emphasis on income changes rather than levels has important
  implications for giving norms. If adaptation is strong, then the
  disutility from giving (reducing one's income) may be temporary, while
  the utility gain for recipients may also diminish over time. This
  complicates utilitarian calculations about optimal giving levels.

  POSITION: Income affects happiness through social comparison and
  adaptation mechanisms. Supports dynamic rather than static models of
  utility.

  journal = {Journal of the European Economic Association},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {221--258},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1542-4774.2012.01101.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper estimates how health status affects the marginal
  utility of consumption using data on life insurance holdings. The authors
  find that worse health is associated with lower marginal utility of
  consumption, suggesting that health and consumption are complements. This
  has important implications for optimal insurance and savings, as it means
  the value of wealth is state-dependent.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on health rather than wealth per se, this paper
  demonstrates that marginal utility is context-dependent and can vary
  across states of the world. If marginal utility of consumption decreases
  when health is poor, this suggests that assets held for insurance against
  health shocks may have diminishing returns. This supports the argument
  that assets beyond a reasonable insurance buffer have low marginal utility.

  POSITION: State-dependent utility. Marginal utility of consumption varies
  with health status, suggesting wealth held for insurance has diminishing
  marginal value.

  journal = {Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {14},
  pages = {386--405},
  doi = {10.1017/bca.2023.29},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This meta-analysis estimates the elasticity of marginal
  utility of income (η), a key parameter for distributional weighting in
  cost-benefit analysis and for computing social discount rates. Analyzing
  estimates from the US and UK, the authors recommend using η = 1.6, with
  sensitivity testing at 1.2 and 2.0. This elasticity implies that
  doubling income reduces marginal utility by about 67%.

  RELEVANCE: The elasticity of marginal utility of income is directly
  relevant for calculating how much more high-income individuals should
  give relative to low-income individuals. An elasticity of 1.6 implies
  substantial diminishing returns to income, strengthening the utilitarian
  case for progressive giving norms. However, the paper focuses on income
  rather than wealth, leaving open the question of whether wealth has
  different elasticity.

  POSITION: Quantifies diminishing marginal utility of income. Provides
  specific parameter estimates for utilitarian calculations.

  title = {Beyond Income: Exploring the Role of Household Wealth for Subjective Well-Being in Germany},
  journal = {Journal of Happiness Studies},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {25},
  doi = {10.1007/s10902-024-00811-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using data from the German Panel on Household Finances,
  this study examines how wealth components (financial assets, real assets,
  secured and unsecured debt) affect subjective well-being. The authors find
  that financial assets have stronger positive associations with well-being
  than real assets of equivalent value, and unsecured debt has strong
  negative associations. Relative wealth (comparison to others) also matters
  significantly.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides crucial empirical evidence on how different
  wealth components affect well-being. The finding that financial assets
  have larger effects than real assets suggests that liquidity and
  optionality contribute to utility beyond the consumption value of assets.
  The strong negative effect of unsecured debt indicates that financial
  vulnerability substantially reduces well-being, supporting the case for
  maintaining a security buffer before giving.

  POSITION: Wealth composition matters for well-being. Financial assets and
  debt have asymmetric effects, with debt being particularly detrimental.

@article{clark2017happiness,
  author = {Clark, Andrew E.},
  title = {Happiness, income and poverty},
  journal = {International Review of Economics},

  volume = {64},
  pages = {145--158},
  doi = {10.1007/S12232-017-0274-7},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper reviews the relationship between income and
  happiness, with particular attention to poverty. Clark emphasizes that
  both absolute and relative income matter for well-being, and that the
  income-happiness gradient is steeper at lower income levels. Poverty has
  large negative effects on happiness that go beyond simple consumption
  effects, including stress, social exclusion, and reduced opportunities.

  RELEVANCE: The steeper gradient at lower income levels provides empirical
  support for diminishing marginal utility of income. This directly
  supports progressive giving norms: transfers from high-income to
  low-income individuals increase total utility. The paper also highlights
  that poverty effects go beyond consumption, suggesting that the marginal
  utility of income for the poor may be even higher than consumption-based
  models would predict.

  POSITION: Diminishing marginal utility of income is steeper at low income
  levels. Poverty has multidimensional negative effects on well-being.

@article{clark2015retirement,
  author = {Clark, Andrew E. and Fawaz, Yarine},
  title = {Retirement and the Marginal Utility of Income},
  journal = {Paris School of Economics Working Paper},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines how the marginal utility of income
  changes at retirement. Using panel data, the authors find that retirement
  is associated with a fall in the marginal utility of income, suggesting
  that individuals derive less well-being from additional income once they
  are no longer working. This may reflect reduced consumption needs,
  different time use, or changes in aspirations.

  RELEVANCE: The finding that marginal utility of income varies across life
  stages has implications for age-differentiated giving norms. If retirees
  have lower marginal utility of income, this might support higher giving
  rates for retirees (especially those with substantial wealth accumulated
  for retirement). However, retirees also face longevity risk and health
  uncertainties, which may justify retaining assets for precautionary
  reasons.

  POSITION: Marginal utility of income varies across life stages, declining
  at retirement. Supports age-differentiated utility functions.

  journal = {Social Psychological and Personality Science},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {483--489},
  doi = {10.1177/1948550614568161},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This study distinguishes between positive affect
  (happiness) and negative affect (sadness) in examining the income-emotion
  relationship. Using day reconstruction method data, the authors find that
  higher income is associated with experiencing less sadness but not with
  experiencing more happiness. This asymmetry suggests that income primarily
  buffers against negative emotions rather than generating positive ones.

  RELEVANCE: The asymmetric relationship between income and positive vs.
  negative affect has implications for understanding what income buys. If
  income mainly reduces sadness (through financial security and stress
  reduction) rather than increasing happiness, this supports the insurance/
  security interpretation of wealth's value. It also suggests that the
  marginal utility of income may be higher for those facing financial
  stress (for whom additional income reduces sadness) than for those with
  financial security (for whom additional income doesn't increase happiness).

  POSITION: Income has asymmetric effects on positive vs. negative affect.
  Supports the view that income provides security/stress reduction rather
  than direct hedonic benefits.

  journal = {Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jebo.2023.01.024},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines the asymmetric response of happiness
  to income gains versus losses. Easterlin finds that happiness decreases
  more when income falls than it increases when income rises by the same
  amount. This asymmetry reflects loss aversion and the ratchet effect of
  aspirations: people quickly adapt to income gains (raising their
  aspirations) but adapt slowly to losses (maintaining previous aspirations).

  RELEVANCE: The asymmetric response to income changes has important
  implications for giving norms. If the pain of giving (reducing one's
  income) is greater than the pleasure recipients gain from increased
  income, this could argue against aggressive giving. However, if the
  asymmetry primarily reflects loss aversion rather than true utility, then
  we might discount this consideration. The finding also suggests that
  aspiration management is crucial for happiness in both giving and receiving.

  POSITION: Asymmetric response to income changes reflects loss aversion
  and aspiration adaptation. Complicates simple models of diminishing
  marginal utility.

  title = {World Happiness Report},

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This inaugural World Happiness Report presents comprehensive
  global data on subjective well-being and its determinants. The report
  documents large variations in happiness across countries and identifies
  six key factors: GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy,
  freedom, generosity, and corruption. Income (GDP per capita) explains
  much of the variation between countries but is only one of several
  important factors.

  RELEVANCE: The World Happiness Report framework emphasizes that income
  is just one component of well-being among several. This suggests that
  utilitarian giving strategies should consider not just income/wealth
  transfers but also interventions that affect social support, health, and
  governance. The report's global perspective also highlights that income
  effects may vary across development levels and cultural contexts.

  doi = {10.1007/s10902-016-9758-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review examines the relationship between
  debt and subjective well-being, finding that debt has consistent negative
  associations with well-being even after controlling for income and assets.
  The negative effects are particularly strong for unsecured debt and for
  debt held by low-income individuals. Debt affects well-being through
  financial stress, reduced sense of control, and social stigma.

  RELEVANCE: The strong negative effects of debt on well-being suggest that
  net wealth (assets minus liabilities) is crucial for utility, not just
  gross assets or income. This supports the argument that assets provide
  utility through security and stress reduction, and that a threshold level
  of net wealth is necessary before giving. The asymmetry between debt
  (strongly negative) and assets (weakly positive) suggests that marginal
  utility may be particularly high for moving from negative to positive
  net wealth.

  income and assets. Net wealth matters more than gross wealth for utility.

  number = {3},
  pages = {591--597},
  doi = {10.1257/AER.103.3.591},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper addresses two puzzles in happiness research.
  First, why does life evaluation rise with income but emotional well-being
  plateau? Second, why does emotional well-being not increase with age
  despite rising life evaluation? The authors propose that life evaluation
  and emotional well-being measure different aspects of well-being, with
  life evaluation reflecting aspirations and comparisons while emotional
  well-being reflects experienced utility.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between evaluative and experiential measures
  of well-being is crucial for understanding what income and wealth buy.
  If income primarily increases life evaluation (through social comparison
  and aspiration satisfaction) rather than experienced happiness, this
  suggests that the marginal utility of income may be lower than naive
  models assume. For utilitarian giving norms, this raises the question
  of which measure of well-being should be prioritized.

  POSITION: Life evaluation and emotional well-being are distinct

  journal = {Journal of Private Enterprise},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {27},
  pages = {63--73},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines the relationship between adaptation
  and diminishing marginal utility of income. Lee argues that adaptation
  to income gains can explain both the Easterlin paradox and the observed
  diminishing marginal utility of income. As people adapt to higher income,
  their reference point shifts, reducing the utility gain from further
  income increases. However, adaptation is not complete, so some utility
  gain remains.

  RELEVANCE: The adaptation mechanism has important implications for
  understanding both the marginal utility of income and the sustainability
  of giving. If adaptation is strong, then the disutility from giving away
  income may be temporary (as people adapt to their new, lower income level).
  Conversely, recipients may quickly adapt to increased income, reducing
  the long-term utility gain. This suggests that the timing and permanence
  of income changes matter for utilitarian calculations.

  POSITION: Adaptation explains diminishing marginal utility of income and
  the Easterlin paradox. Supports dynamic models of utility with shifting
  reference points.

  pages = {2075--2102},
  doi = {10.1007/s10902-020-00309-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using three-wave panel data from the US, this study finds
  that hope partially mediates the relationship between income and
  subjective well-being, but only for monthly incomes over $1,800. The
  agency component of hope (belief in one's ability to achieve goals) is
  the strongest mediator. This suggests that income affects well-being
  partly by improving people's sense of control over their future.

  RELEVANCE: The mediating role of hope and agency suggests that income
  provides utility not just through consumption but through perceived
  optionality and control. This supports the view that wealth (which
  provides future options) may have different utility characteristics than
  current income (which enables current consumption). The threshold effect
  at $1,800/month also suggests that the income-well-being relationship
  may be highly nonlinear, with different mechanisms operating at different
  income levels.

  POSITION: Hope and agency mediate the income-well-being relationship.
  Income provides utility through enhanced sense of control and future
