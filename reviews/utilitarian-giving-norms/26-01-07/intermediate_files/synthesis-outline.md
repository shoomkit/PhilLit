# Literature Review Outline: Utilitarian Giving Norms — Income vs. Asset-Based Obligations

**Research Project**: Whether utilitarian obligations to charitable giving are better implemented through income-based norms (e.g., GWWC 10% pledge) or asset-based norms, given systematic asymmetries in the marginal utility of income versus assets.

## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the tension between existing income-based philanthropic norms and the theoretical possibility that asset-based norms better satisfy utilitarian obligations.

**Content**:
- Open with Singer's foundational argument: preventing bad without comparable sacrifice creates stringent giving obligations (Singer 1972)
- Note that effective altruism institutionalized this through income-based pledges (MacAskill 2015; Singer 2015)
- Introduce the puzzle: Why income as the base? GWWC's 10% pledge treats asset accumulation as morally neutral, but utilitarian logic seems indifferent to resource source
- State the research question: Does a systematic asymmetry in marginal utility between income and assets favor asset-sensitive giving strategies?
- Preview the review structure: foundational obligations, the income-asset asymmetry, temporal considerations, research gaps

**Key Papers**: Singer 1972, MacAskill 2015, MacAskill/Mogensen/Ord 2018 (tithing defense)

**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: Utilitarian Obligations and Their Limits

**Section Purpose**: Establish the philosophical foundation for giving obligations while mapping the demandingness debate that constrains permissible norm designs.

### Subsection 1.1: The Structure of Utilitarian Giving Arguments

**Papers**: Singer 1972, Unger 1996, Lichtenberg 2010, Cullity 1994

**Content**:
- Singer's principle: prevent suffering without comparable sacrifice
- Unger's psychological reinforcement via thought experiments (Vintage Sedan case—notably involving an *asset*, not income)
- Lichtenberg's reframing as negative duties (harm we cause through global systems)
- Cullity's fair-share refinement limiting individual obligations to collective contributions

**Gap Connection**: These foundational arguments do not specify which resources constitute "affluence"—income flows, asset stocks, or some combination. The default focus on income appears assumed rather than argued.

### Subsection 1.2: Demandingness and Moderate Positions

**Papers**: Scheffler 1982, Kagan 1989, Murphy 2000, Cullity 2004, Mulgan 2001

**Content**:
- Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives: agents may give disproportionate weight to personal projects
- Kagan's stringent response: demandingness is not genuinely objectionable
- Murphy's cooperative principle: under partial compliance, only fair-share contributions required
- Cullity's iterative reasoning problem: does helping one person generate unlimited further obligations?
- Mulgan's realm-based approach: subsistence vs. survival vs. sacrifice contexts

**Gap Connection**: Demandingness responses rarely consider whether income vs. assets affects how demanding a norm is. Murphy's fair-share calculation could incorporate asset holdings; Cullity's life-project constraint might justify protecting assets differently from income. These possibilities remain unexplored.

### Subsection 1.3: Effective Altruism's Institutionalization of Giving Norms

**Papers**: MacAskill 2015, Singer 2015, MacAskill/Mogensen/Ord 2018, Lim 2019

**Content**:
- EA's income-based framework: earning to give, 10% pledge, cause prioritization
- The tithing defense: 10% of gross income is demanding but achievable (MacAskill/Mogensen/Ord 2018)
- Adaptation evidence: people adjust to moderate income reductions
- Critical perspective: Lim's ecumenicity objection—EA privileges utilitarian maximization

**Gap Connection**: EA's income focus appears pragmatic rather than principled. MacAskill et al. defend tithing's demandingness without comparing it to asset-based alternatives. The implicit assumption that asset accumulation is morally neutral deserves scrutiny.

**Section Summary**: Utilitarian arguments generate significant giving obligations, moderated by demandingness constraints. EA institutionalized these as income-based norms, but the philosophical literature provides no principled reason to prefer income over assets as the obligatory base.

**Word Target**: 900-1100 words

## Section 2: The Income-Asset Asymmetry

**Section Purpose**: Examine whether marginal utility differences between income and assets provide normative grounds for differential treatment in giving obligations.

### Subsection 2.1: Marginal Utility of Income — Diminishing Returns

**Papers**: Kahneman/Deaton 2010, Killingsworth et al. 2023, Acland/Greenberg 2023, Clark et al. 2019

**Content**:
- Kahneman/Deaton satiation finding: emotional well-being plateaus at ~$75k; life evaluation continues rising
- Killingsworth et al. revision: satiation only for unhappiest 20%; most people show continued (log) gains
- Acland/Greenberg meta-analysis: elasticity of marginal utility ~1.6 (doubling income reduces MU by 67%)
- Social comparison and adaptation effects (Easterlin paradox, Clark et al.)

**Gap Connection**: Strong evidence for diminishing marginal utility of income supports progressive giving. But these findings concern income flows, not asset stocks.

### Subsection 2.2: Marginal Utility of Wealth — Distinct Mechanisms

**Papers**: Headey 2019, D'Ambrosio et al. 2019, Jantsch et al. 2024, Tay et al. 2016

**Content**:
- Headey's key finding: wealth influences life satisfaction *more than income* in cross-national comparisons
- D'Ambrosio et al.: wealth provides distinct security benefits beyond consumption utility
- Jantsch et al.: financial assets have stronger well-being effects than real assets; debt strongly negative
- Tay et al.: net wealth (assets minus debt) crucial for utility, not gross holdings

**Gap Connection**: If wealth matters more than income for well-being (per Headey), this could cut either way: perhaps assets *should* be protected rather than given away, since they contribute disproportionately to welfare. Or perhaps wealthy individuals can afford to give *more* without comparable sacrifice. The literature does not address this ambiguity for giving norms.

### Subsection 2.3: Insurance, Security, and the "Threshold" Hypothesis

**Papers**: Finkelstein et al. 2013, Kushlev et al. 2015, Wiepking/Breeze 2012, Burri 2020

**Content**:
- Insurance interpretation: assets provide utility through risk reduction and optionality, not just consumption (Finkelstein et al.)
- Kushlev et al.: income reduces sadness more than it increases happiness—security mechanism
- Wiepking/Breeze: *subjective* financial security matters more than objective resources for giving
- Burri: option value framework—assets preserve flexibility that income-based giving forecloses

**Gap Connection**: A "security threshold" hypothesis emerges: assets provide high marginal utility up to some threshold (insurance, emergency fund, retirement security), but low marginal utility beyond it. If correct, this supports asset-based giving norms that exempt threshold assets but require redistribution of excess. However, no paper articulates or tests this hypothesis for charitable giving contexts.

### Subsection 2.4: Distributive Justice Parallels — Taxing Income vs. Wealth

**Papers**: Halliday 2018, Murphy/Nagel 2002, Delmotte/Cowen 2022, Fleischer 2022

**Content**:
- Halliday: inherited wealth creates unjust inequality requiring progressive taxation (Rignano scheme)
- Murphy/Nagel: pre-tax property rights are "myth"; all resources equally available for redistribution
- Delmotte/Cowen: practical objection—asset valuation is epistemically problematic (mark-to-market issues)
- Fleischer: even libertarians can support inheritance taxation on benefit theory

**Gap Connection**: Taxation debates provide normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets, but assume coercive redistribution. Adapting these arguments to *voluntary* charitable giving requires additional normative work not yet undertaken.

**Section Summary**: Empirical evidence establishes diminishing marginal utility for both income and wealth, with wealth providing distinct security-based utility. A plausible "threshold hypothesis" suggests assets beyond security levels contribute little to welfare, potentially supporting asset-based giving norms. However, no literature directly compares marginal utility of income vs. assets for charitable giving decisions.

**Word Target**: 1000-1200 words

## Section 3: Temporal Dimensions — Giving Now vs. Later

**Section Purpose**: Examine how time preference, investment returns, and deferred giving affect the case for income-based vs. asset-based norms.

### Subsection 3.1: The Ethics of Time Discounting

**Papers**: Greaves 2017, Heath 2017, Greene 2021, Zuber/Fleurbaey 2021

**Content**:
- Time neutralism: Greaves argues pure time preference lacks ethical justification; Ramsey/Sidgwick tradition
- Positive time preference: Heath defends discounting via non-identity and generational sovereignty
- Greene's defense of zero discounting as normative standard against permissivism
- Zuber/Fleurbaey: distinguish impartiality from priority in intergenerational ethics

**Gap Connection**: If time neutralism holds, future giving from assets has equal moral weight to present giving from income. If positive time preference is justified, present-oriented income norms are favored. The literature does not apply this debate directly to individual philanthropic obligations.

### Subsection 3.2: Patient Philanthropy and the Case for Asset-Based Giving

**Papers**: Trammell 2020, Madoff/Soskis 2023, Founders Pledge 2021, Greaves/MacAskill 2021

**Content**:
- Trammell's formal model: patient philanthropists should invest for centuries if time preferences vary
- Practical implementation: Founders Pledge's Patient Philanthropy Fund
- Historical perspective: Madoff/Soskis on shifting norms between perpetuity and spending-down
- Counterargument: "hinge of history" hypothesis (Greaves/MacAskill) favors present action

**Gap Connection**: Patient philanthropy directly implies asset-based obligations—if optimal strategy is invest-then-give, holding assets fulfills rather than defers obligations. Yet patient philanthropy literature focuses on *institutional* fund management, not *individual* norm compliance. Whether an individual's personal asset accumulation counts as fulfilling giving obligations remains unaddressed.

### Subsection 3.3: Behavioral and Implementation Challenges

**Papers**: Andreoni/Serra-Garcia 2017, Andreoni/Serra-Garcia 2016, Ring/Thoresen 2025, Meer et al. 2020

**Content**:
- Time-inconsistent giving: present bias causes gap between intentions and behavior (Andreoni)
- Commitment devices: pledges increase giving 20-30% by binding future selves
- Wealth taxation effects: Ring/Thoresen find wealth taxes *reduce* charitable giving in Norway
- Income vs. wealth as behavioral predictors: both independently predict giving, but through different mechanisms (Meer/Priday)

**Gap Connection**: Even if asset-based norms are theoretically superior, implementation faces psychological barriers. Time inconsistency may be *more* problematic for asset-based giving (requires active liquidation decisions that can be postponed). Income-based norms via automatic deduction may be more behaviorally robust.

**Section Summary**: Time discounting debates are unresolved, but patient philanthropy provides a distinct case for asset-based norms grounded in investment returns rather than pure time preference. However, behavioral evidence suggests income-based norms may be more psychologically implementable, creating a theory-practice tension.

**Word Target**: 700-900 words

## Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what's missing in the literature and how the research addresses these gaps.

### Gap 1: No Direct Comparison of Income vs. Asset-Based Giving Obligations

- **Evidence**: The philosophical literature on utilitarian giving (Singer, Unger, Murphy, Cullity) discusses obligations to aid without specifying whether obligations derive from income flows or asset stocks. EA institutions (GWWC) adopted income-based norms without philosophical justification for this choice. Aloyo 2023 critiques tithing on wealth grounds but does not develop an alternative framework.
- **Why it matters**: If marginal utility differs systematically between income and assets, utilitarian calculations may favor asset-sensitive norms. The absence of direct philosophical treatment leaves a major lacuna in the giving obligations literature.
- **How research addresses it**: The project provides the first systematic utilitarian analysis comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions.

### Gap 2: Undefined "Security Threshold" for Assets

- **Evidence**: Empirical work shows assets provide utility through security and optionality (Finkelstein et al., Kushlev et al.), suggesting a threshold below which assets are high-utility and above which they are low-utility. Tay et al. show net wealth matters more than gross. But no paper quantifies this threshold or applies it to giving obligations.
- **Why it matters**: A security threshold would provide principled grounds for distinguishing obligatory giving from protected savings. Without it, asset-based norms risk being either too demanding (requiring liquidation of emergency funds) or too permissive (allowing unlimited asset accumulation as "precautionary").
- **How research addresses it**: The project develops an explicit threshold model specifying when assets become subject to giving obligations.

### Gap 3: Unresolved Tension Between Time Neutralism and Patient Philanthropy for Individual Norms

- **Evidence**: Time neutralism (Greaves, Greene) suggests future giving has equal moral weight to present giving. Patient philanthropy (Trammell) shows investment can multiply impact dramatically. But both literatures focus on institutional fund management, not individual moral obligations. It remains unclear whether personal asset accumulation (with intent to give later) satisfies or defers individual giving duties.
- **Why it matters**: If holding assets for future giving counts as fulfilling obligations, asset-based norms could be *less* demanding than income norms (give later, but more). If it counts as deferral, asset-holders face ongoing unfulfilled obligations.
- **How research addresses it**: The project clarifies how temporal considerations affect the moral status of asset-holding for individuals, not just institutions.

### Gap 4: Limited Integration Across Domains

- **Evidence**: Distributive justice (taxation) and charity ethics literatures are largely separate. Luck egalitarian arguments for wealth taxation (Halliday, Dworkin) do not appear in EA literature. Behavioral giving research (Bekkers, Andreoni) rarely engages with normative philosophy. Murphy's cooperative principle has not been applied to asset-based fair shares.
- **Why it matters**: Cross-domain integration could reveal that existing frameworks, properly combined, already favor asset-based norms—or reveal principled objections that domain-specific literatures overlook.
- **How research addresses it**: The project explicitly synthesizes marginal utility evidence, demandingness constraints, and temporal considerations into a unified framework for comparing giving norm designs.

**Synthesis**: These gaps collectively show that while the components for an asset-based giving analysis exist across literatures, no work has assembled them into a systematic comparison with income-based alternatives. The research project fills this lacuna.

**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the state of the literature and position the research contribution.

**Content**:
- Summary: Utilitarian arguments establish significant giving obligations (Section 1), moderated by demandingness constraints. Evidence suggests systematic differences in marginal utility between income and assets (Section 2), with assets providing high utility up to a security threshold. Temporal considerations complicate the analysis (Section 3), but neither support nor refute asset-based norms decisively.
- Current practice: EA norms focus on income without principled justification; this may reflect practical considerations (ease of measurement, psychological tractability) rather than utilitarian superiority.
- Main gaps: No direct philosophical comparison of income vs. asset-based obligations; no articulated security threshold; unresolved temporal status of individual asset-holding.
- Research contribution: First systematic analysis comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions, incorporating marginal utility asymmetries, security thresholds, and temporal discounting.
- Implications: If asset-based norms prove superior, this would have significant practical implications for how affluent individuals should structure their giving, potentially favoring wealth taxes on oneself over income tithing.

- Avoid advocacy for specific conclusions; present the case for further investigation

### Key Objections to Address

1. **Liquidity objection**: Assets are harder to convert to donations than income (Delmotte/Cowen's valuation problem)
2. **Psychological feasibility**: Giving from assets feels different and may face greater resistance (Wiepking/Breeze)
3. **Demandingness escalation**: Asset-based norms may be more demanding in aggregate (requires Sections 1.2 response)
4. **Temporal uncertainty**: If patient philanthropy is right, asset-holding may be *better* than income giving (requires Section 3.2 engagement)
