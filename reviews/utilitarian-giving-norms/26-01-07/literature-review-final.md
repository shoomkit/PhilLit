## Introduction

In 1972, Peter Singer argued that affluent individuals face stringent moral obligations to prevent suffering when they can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance (Singer 1972). This deceptively simple principle—applied to the empirical reality that charitable donations can prevent death and extreme poverty—generates demanding conclusions about how much the wealthy ought to give. Singer's argument has profoundly shaped contemporary moral philosophy and, more recently, the effective altruism movement that emerged to operationalize utilitarian beneficence.

Effective altruism institutionalized Singer's insights through practical commitment mechanisms, most notably the Giving What We Can pledge to donate at least 10% of gross income to highly effective charities (MacAskill 2015; Singer 2015). This income-based framework has become the default structure for organized giving: the movement tracks donations as income percentages, career advice centers on "earning to give" from high-income professions, and moral progress is measured through pledge fulfillment. MacAskill's foundational work treats current income as the primary locus of moral agency in giving decisions.

Yet this income-focused approach raises a puzzle that the philosophical literature has largely overlooked: Why income rather than assets? The 10% income pledge treats asset accumulation as morally neutral—an individual who earns modestly while holding substantial wealth may satisfy the pledge while giving far less than their total resources would permit. Unger's (1996) famous Vintage Sedan case, in which we must sacrifice a valuable possession to save a life, notably involves an asset rather than income. The original utilitarian logic appears indifferent to whether obligatory resources derive from salary, savings, or inherited wealth. If preventing suffering without comparable sacrifice is what morality demands, the source of one's resources seems irrelevant.

This review investigates a specific research question: Does a systematic asymmetry in the marginal utility of income versus assets provide normative grounds for preferring one giving base over the other? If giving from income and giving from assets have different welfare implications for the donor—owing to psychological security, consumption patterns, or temporal considerations—then utilitarian calculation may favor asset-sensitive giving strategies over the income-based norms that currently dominate.

The review proceeds as follows. Section 1 establishes the philosophical foundations of utilitarian giving obligations and surveys demandingness constraints that shape permissible norm designs. Section 2 examines empirical evidence on marginal utility differences between income and wealth, identifying a possible "security threshold" that distinguishes high-utility from low-utility assets. Section 3 considers temporal dimensions—time discounting, patient philanthropy, and behavioral feasibility—that complicate the income-asset comparison. The review concludes by identifying specific gaps in the literature and positioning the research contribution.


## Utilitarian Obligations and Their Limits

### The Structure of Utilitarian Giving Arguments

The philosophical case for stringent charitable giving obligations originates in Peter Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972), which advances a deceptively simple principle: if we can prevent something bad from happening without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so. Applied to global poverty, this principle generates demanding conclusions—affluent individuals must give until further giving would cause them suffering comparable to that of famine victims. The argument's power lies in its structural simplicity: distance is morally irrelevant, and the drowning child we would save at personal cost has no morally relevant distinction from the distant stranger we could save through donation.

Peter Unger (1996) reinforced Singer's conclusions through psychological rather than strictly logical means. His thought experiments, most notably the Vintage Sedan case, demonstrate that our intuitions condemn those who refuse to sacrifice valuable possessions to save lives. Notably, Unger's paradigm case involves an asset—a cherished automobile—rather than income, suggesting that the utilitarian case for giving does not intrinsically privilege one resource type over another. The psychological resistance Unger diagnoses stems from motivated reasoning about our current behavior, not from principled distinctions between types of sacrifice.

Two important refinements moderate these demanding conclusions. Judith Lichtenberg (2010) reframes giving obligations as negative rather than purely positive duties, arguing that affluent individuals participate in global systems that cause harm. This reframing strengthens the case for obligation while shifting its grounding: we give not merely because we can help but because we bear responsibility for ongoing harm. Garrett Cullity (1994) introduces a fair-share principle, distinguishing direct duties to those we encounter from collective duties that should be distributed among potential helpers. This limits individual demands without abandoning the core insight that significant obligations exist.

These foundational arguments share a notable lacuna: none specifies whether "affluence" or "surplus resources" refers to income flows, asset stocks, or some combination. Singer's examples typically invoke income, but his principle applies to any resource whose sacrifice would not constitute comparable moral loss. The default focus on income appears assumed rather than argued.

### Demandingness and Moderate Positions

The demandingness objection to consequentialism holds that requiring agents always to maximize the good is unreasonably stringent. Samuel Scheffler (1982) developed the most influential moderate response, arguing for agent-centered prerogatives that permit individuals to give disproportionate weight to their own projects and relationships. On Scheffler's view, morality cannot demand abandonment of the personal point of view that structures individual lives.

Shelly Kagan (1989) offers the most forceful rejection of such prerogatives, contending that demandingness objections lack principled foundation. What seems excessive merely reflects what morality genuinely requires; the intuition that obligations cannot be so demanding reflects motivated reasoning rather than moral insight. For Kagan, neither income nor assets deserves special protection from beneficence demands.

Liam Murphy (2000) charts a middle course through his cooperative principle: under conditions of partial compliance, agents need only contribute their fair share of the collectively optimal action, not compensate for others' failures. If wealthy individuals generally fail to give, compliant agents are not obligated to give more to make up the shortfall. This framework has significant but unexplored implications for the income-asset distinction: fair shares might be calculated based on total wealth rather than income alone, potentially demanding more from the asset-rich.

Cullity (2004) identifies the iterative reasoning problem confronting utilitarian beneficence: if helping one person generates obligation to help the next, demands iterate toward impoverishment. His solution appeals to "appropriate impartiality" as fairness, setting limits without invoking agent-relative prerogatives. Tim Mulgan (2001) proposes a realm-based approach, distinguishing subsistence, survival, and sacrifice contexts governed by different moral principles. Asset liquidation might cross from subsistence into sacrifice realm, where supererogation rather than obligation obtains.

Critically, none of these moderate positions considers whether income and assets affect demandingness differentially. Murphy's cooperative principle could incorporate asset holdings into fair-share calculations; Cullity's life-project constraint might justify protecting assets that secure long-term plans differently from income that funds immediate consumption. These possibilities remain unexplored.

### Effective Altruism's Institutionalization of Giving Norms

Effective altruism institutionalized utilitarian giving obligations through specific mechanisms, most notably Giving What We Can's pledge to donate ten percent of income to effective charities. William MacAskill (2015) established the movement's practical framework, emphasizing earning to give, cause prioritization, and evidence-based charity selection. Peter Singer (2015) provided philosophical continuity, extending his earlier arguments into EA's optimization framework.

MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord (2018) defend the tithing model directly, arguing that ten percent of gross income is demanding enough to make meaningful impact while remaining psychologically sustainable. They cite evidence that donors adapt to moderate income reductions, maintaining well-being despite decreased consumption. The defense is explicitly pragmatic: the pledge must be demanding enough to matter but achievable enough to sustain long-term compliance.

This pragmatic framing reveals that EA's income focus appears more practical than principled. The tithing defense addresses income's demandingness without comparing it to asset-based alternatives. Chong-Ming Lim (2019) argues that EA's apparent ecumenicity masks specifically utilitarian commitments incompatible with moral pluralism. If so, EA's income-based norms embody consequentialist calculations that could equally justify asset-based demands—the choice of income appears to reflect institutional convenience rather than theoretical necessity.

The implicit assumption that asset accumulation is morally neutral while income triggers ongoing obligations deserves scrutiny. A retiree with substantial assets but minimal income faces trivial demands under current EA norms, while a young professional earning well but holding no assets faces significant obligations. Whether this asymmetry reflects sound utilitarian reasoning or merely institutional path-dependence remains unexamined in the literature.

---

**Section Summary**: Utilitarian arguments from Singer through Unger establish significant giving obligations, moderated by demandingness constraints from Scheffler, Murphy, and Cullity. Effective altruism institutionalized these obligations through income-based norms, but the philosophical literature provides no principled reason to prefer income over assets as the obligatory base. The choice appears pragmatic rather than theoretically grounded.


## Section 2: The Income-Asset Asymmetry

Utilitarian giving norms require understanding the marginal utility that different resource types provide to their holders. If income and assets generate utility through distinct mechanisms with different diminishing-return profiles, this asymmetry may ground normatively significant distinctions in giving obligations. This section examines empirical evidence on the marginal utility of income versus wealth, the security-based utility that assets provide, and parallel debates in distributive justice about differential treatment of income and wealth.

### 2.1 Marginal Utility of Income: Diminishing Returns

The diminishing marginal utility of income is well-established empirically, though its precise contours remain debated. Kahneman and Deaton (2010) distinguished two components of subjective well-being: emotional well-being (daily experienced affect) and life evaluation (overall life satisfaction). Their analysis of 450,000 U.S. respondents found that emotional well-being plateaus at approximately $75,000 annual income, while life evaluation continues rising logarithmically without satiation. This finding suggested a threshold beyond which additional income yields sharply diminished hedonic returns.

However, Killingsworth, Kahneman, and Mellers (2023) substantially revised this picture through joint reanalysis of conflicting datasets. They found that the flattening pattern exists only for the unhappiest 20 percent of the population; for most people, emotional well-being continues rising with log-income without a clear satiation point. The logarithmic relationship nonetheless implies significant diminishing returns: each doubling of income yields approximately equal incremental well-being. Acland and Greenberg (2023) quantify this through meta-analysis, estimating the elasticity of marginal utility of income at approximately 1.6, meaning that doubling income reduces marginal utility by roughly 67 percent.

Social comparison and adaptation effects further complicate the income-utility relationship. Clark et al. (2019) emphasize that changes in income matter more than absolute levels for well-being, and that adaptation quickly erodes gains from income increases. The Easterlin paradox--that rising national income does not increase average happiness over time--suggests that relative position rather than absolute income drives much of the income-happiness correlation (Easterlin et al. 2010). These mechanisms imply that the marginal utility of income may be even lower than absolute well-being correlations suggest, strengthening the case for progressive giving norms.

Crucially, this evidence concerns income flows, not asset stocks. Whether wealth exhibits similar diminishing-return patterns through analogous or distinct mechanisms remains a separate empirical question.

### 2.2 Marginal Utility of Wealth: Distinct Mechanisms

Evidence suggests that wealth influences well-being through mechanisms partially distinct from income. Headey (2019), analyzing household panel data from Australia, Britain, and Germany, found that wealth has a stronger association with life satisfaction than income, even controlling for income levels. This finding directly challenges income-centric approaches to measuring capacity for charitable giving: if wealth matters more than income for well-being, wealth-holders may have either greater reason to protect their assets or greater capacity to give without comparable sacrifice.

D'Ambrosio, Jantti, and Lepinteur (2019) provide a decomposition showing that wealth provides distinct security benefits beyond consumption utility. Financial assets in particular correlate with reduced stress and greater life satisfaction independent of current income. Jantsch, Le Blanc, and Schmidt (2024) refine this picture by demonstrating that different asset classes have asymmetric effects: financial assets show stronger positive associations with well-being than real assets of equivalent value, while unsecured debt has particularly strong negative effects. This suggests that liquidity and optionality, not just total net worth, contribute to utility.

The work by Tay et al. (2016) on debt and subjective well-being reinforces that net wealth--assets minus liabilities--is crucial for utility, not gross holdings. Moving from negative to positive net worth produces larger well-being gains than equivalent increases at higher wealth levels. This asymmetry suggests a threshold below which wealth provides high marginal utility (by establishing basic financial security) and above which marginal utility declines sharply.

### 2.3 Insurance, Security, and the Threshold Hypothesis

The distinct mechanisms through which wealth provides utility point toward what might be called a "threshold hypothesis": assets provide high marginal utility up to some security level, but low marginal utility beyond it. Several lines of evidence support this interpretation.

Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2013), examining how health affects the marginal utility of consumption, demonstrate that utility is state-dependent--the value of wealth varies with contingencies it might address. This supports viewing assets as providing utility through insurance and optionality rather than direct consumption. Kushlev, Dunn, and Lucas (2015) find that higher income reduces sadness but does not increase happiness, suggesting income primarily buffers against negative states rather than generating positive affect. If wealth serves a similar buffering function, its marginal utility should be high when exposure to downside risk is significant and low once adequate protection exists.

Wiepking and Breeze (2012) demonstrate that *subjective* perception of financial security matters more for giving behavior than objective resources. People who feel financially insecure give less even controlling for actual income and wealth. This finding suggests that the psychological utility of assets depends on perceived adequacy for security needs rather than absolute amounts. Burri (2020) frames this as the "option value" that wealth provides--maintaining flexibility for future contingencies that income-based giving would foreclose.

These considerations suggest a threshold model: assets below the security threshold provide high marginal utility (insurance against adverse states), while assets beyond this threshold contribute primarily positional or aspirational utility with sharply diminishing returns. If correct, this framework supports asset-based giving norms that exempt threshold holdings but require redistribution of excess. However, no paper in the empirical literature explicitly articulates or tests this threshold hypothesis for charitable giving contexts.

### 2.4 Distributive Justice Parallels: Taxing Income vs. Wealth

Philosophical debates about taxation provide normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets, though these assume coercive redistribution rather than voluntary giving. Halliday (2018) defends progressive inheritance taxation through a "Rignano scheme" where inherited wealth faces higher tax rates with each successive generation, preventing dynastic accumulation. This approach treats inherited assets as categorically different from earned income--a distinction potentially relevant to voluntary giving obligations if source affects the legitimacy of retention.

Murphy and Nagel (2002) take a more radical position, arguing that pre-tax property rights are a "myth": property is conventionally defined by legal systems including taxation, so there is no natural baseline from which redistribution represents a taking. If correct, this dissolves any principled distinction between income and assets--all resources are equally available for redistribution. However, their focus on legal property rights may not directly translate to moral obligations of voluntary giving.

Practical objections challenge asset-based approaches. Delmotte and Cowen (2022) argue that capital assets lack determinate values except at realization points, making wealth taxation "arbitrary and unfair" due to dynamic and subjective valuation. This epistemological concern applies equally to voluntary giving: individuals may face severe informational barriers in assessing their true wealth for giving purposes, potentially favoring income-based norms on implementability grounds.

Yet even from libertarian perspectives, differential treatment of assets may be justified. Fleischer (2022) argues that inheritance taxation is compatible with--even required by--classical liberal principles, since heirs benefit from state protection of their inheritance and should pay for that benefit. If taxation of inherited wealth can be justified on libertarian grounds, voluntary giving obligations might apply even more strongly to unearned advantages that individuals themselves recognize as morally arbitrary.

These debates provide conceptual resources for distinguishing income from wealth in giving obligations, but assume coercive redistribution. Adapting these frameworks to voluntary charitable giving requires additional normative work: the state's legitimate authority to tax does not directly establish individuals' moral obligations to give, and the psychological dynamics of voluntary versus compelled giving differ significantly.

### Section Summary

Empirical evidence establishes diminishing marginal utility for both income and wealth, with the relationship more complex than simple satiation models suggest. Wealth appears to influence well-being through distinct security-based mechanisms, with financial assets providing utility through insurance and optionality beyond consumption value. A plausible "threshold hypothesis" emerges: assets below a security level provide high marginal utility, while excess assets contribute mainly positional utility with sharply diminishing returns. This asymmetry potentially supports asset-based giving norms that protect threshold holdings while requiring redistribution of excess wealth. However, no existing literature directly articulates this threshold model for charitable giving contexts, and practical implementation faces epistemological challenges around asset valuation that income-based approaches avoid.


## Temporal Dimensions — Giving Now vs. Later

The debate over income-based versus asset-based giving norms gains a distinct temporal dimension when we consider whether resources should be deployed immediately or invested for future philanthropic impact. This section examines how ethical arguments about time preference, the emerging case for patient philanthropy, and behavioral realities of implementation interact to complicate the choice between giving from income now or accumulating assets for later disbursement.

### The Ethics of Time Discounting

The classical utilitarian tradition, following Ramsey and Sidgwick, holds that pure time preference—discounting future welfare merely because of its temporal location—lacks ethical justification. Greaves (2017) provides the most comprehensive survey of this position, distinguishing pure time preference from empirically grounded reasons for discounting such as opportunity costs of capital or uncertainty about future states. On this view, the temporal location of a benefit is morally arbitrary; a unit of welfare realized in fifty years matters as much as one realized today. Greene (2021) reinforces this time neutralist position, arguing that it constitutes a methodological stance about evaluating preferences rather than a metaphysical claim about the existence of "pure" preferences.

Against time neutralism, Heath (2017) offers the most sustained defense of positive social time preference. Drawing on non-identity considerations, he argues that present policies often alter which future people will exist, complicating claims that we "harm" future generations by discounting. Heath further appeals to generational sovereignty: each generation may have legitimate authority over its own resources, justifying some priority to present over future claims. Zuber and Fleurbaey (2021) add analytical clarity by separating two dimensions often conflated in discounting debates—impartiality across generations and priority to worse-off generations. Even if we grant temporal impartiality, priority-weighted approaches might favor present giving if future generations will be wealthier.

The implications for giving norms are direct but underexplored. If time neutralism holds, future giving from invested assets carries equal moral weight to present giving from income, undermining any intrinsic preference for income-based norms. If positive time preference is justified, obligations attach more strongly to present resources, favoring immediate income-based giving. Yet neither philosophical camp has explicitly applied these arguments to individual philanthropic obligations—the debate remains at the level of public policy and intergenerational justice.

### Patient Philanthropy and the Case for Asset-Based Giving

The case for deferring philanthropy finds its most rigorous articulation in Trammell's (2020) formal models of optimal timing under heterogeneous time preferences. Trammell demonstrates that patient philanthropists—those with low discount rates—should typically invest rather than spend, potentially for centuries, before disbursing funds. Under plausible parameters, his models suggest effective altruists should accumulate resources indefinitely until commanding a substantial fraction of societal wealth. The logic is straightforward: if investment returns exceed the rate at which philanthropic opportunities improve, compounding dominates.

This framework has moved from theory to practice. Founders Pledge (2021) launched a Patient Philanthropy Fund explicitly inspired by Trammell's research, committing capital to long-term investment before future deployment. Madoff and Soskis (2023) provide historical perspective, documenting how philanthropic norms have oscillated between perpetual endowments and spending-down mandates across eras—suggesting current preferences for immediate disbursement are culturally contingent rather than ethically fixed.

Yet patient philanthropy faces a significant counterargument: the "hinge of history" hypothesis. Greaves and MacAskill (2021) argue that the present may be uniquely pivotal for shaping long-run outcomes, particularly regarding existential risks and civilizational trajectory. If we are indeed at a hinge, the case for deploying resources now strengthens considerably, since waiting risks missing critical windows for influence.

A notable gap emerges in translating these institutional arguments to individual obligations. Patient philanthropy literature focuses on philanthropic funds and foundations, not individual donors. Whether a person's private asset accumulation—with intent to give later—fulfills or merely defers moral obligations remains unaddressed. This ambiguity is central to evaluating asset-based norms: if holding assets for future giving counts as fulfilling one's obligations, asset-based approaches may be less demanding than income-based tithing; if it counts as deferral, asset-holders face ongoing unfulfilled obligations.

### Behavioral and Implementation Challenges

Even if theoretical considerations favor asset-based giving, psychological and behavioral evidence suggests implementation faces significant barriers. Andreoni and Serra-Garcia (2016, 2017) document time-inconsistent charitable giving: donors exhibit present bias, being more generous about future commitments than present ones. This creates a gap between endorsed norms and actual behavior that commitment devices—such as pledges—can partially bridge. Their experiments show pledges increase giving by 20-30%, with effects concentrated among sophisticated time-inconsistent givers who recognize their own present bias.

Time inconsistency may pose greater problems for asset-based than income-based giving. Converting assets to donations requires active liquidation decisions that can be indefinitely postponed, while income-based giving can operate through automatic payroll deduction. Meer and Priday (2020) find that both income and wealth independently predict giving, but through different mechanisms—income through regular decision opportunities, wealth through major life events and estate planning. This suggests income provides more natural behavioral hooks for implementing giving norms.

Fiscal evidence reinforces implementation concerns. Ring and Thoresen (2025) exploit a Norwegian wealth tax shock to estimate effects on charitable giving, finding that a 1% wealth tax reduces giving by approximately 26%. While this reflects coerced rather than voluntary giving, it suggests that treating wealth as an obligatory base may face strong behavioral resistance, possibly due to liquidity constraints or psychological attachment to assets as security buffers.

The result is a theory-practice tension: time discounting debates remain unresolved, but patient philanthropy provides a coherent case for asset-based obligations grounded in investment returns rather than pure time preference. Yet behavioral evidence suggests income-based norms may be more psychologically implementable due to their alignment with regular decision-making and automatic commitment mechanisms. Whether asset-based norms can overcome these implementation barriers—perhaps through novel commitment devices or reframing strategies—remains an open empirical question with significant implications for norm design.


## Research Gaps, Opportunities, and Conclusion

The preceding sections have mapped an extensive literature spanning utilitarian obligations, marginal utility research, and temporal considerations in philanthropy. Yet this literature exhibits significant lacunae precisely where the income-versus-assets question demands answers. Four interconnected gaps emerge as particularly consequential for developing a principled account of giving obligations.

### Gap 1: No Direct Comparison of Income-Based Versus Asset-Based Giving Obligations

The philosophical literature on utilitarian giving obligations discusses what affluent individuals owe without specifying whether obligations derive from income flows or asset stocks. Singer's (1972) foundational argument that we should prevent suffering "without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance" leaves indeterminate which resources constitute the obligatory base. Unger's (1996) Vintage Sedan thought experiment---notably involving destruction of an *asset* rather than sacrifice of income---suggests intuitions may favor treating assets as morally available for redistribution, yet this implication remains undeveloped. Murphy's (2000) cooperative principle limits obligations to fair shares of collective action but does not address whether fair shares should be calculated against income, wealth, or some combination. Cullity's (2004) life-project constraint might justify protecting assets differently from income if long-term projects depend more on asset security, but this possibility is not explored.

The effective altruism movement institutionalized giving obligations through income-based norms---Giving What We Can's 10% pledge, Singer's graduated income scale---without providing principled justification for choosing income over assets as the baseline (MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord 2018; Singer 2015). Aloyo (2023) critiques this income focus, arguing that wealth inequality exceeds income inequality and that focusing on income allows the very rich to discharge obligations cheaply. Yet Aloyo's proposal for progressive wealth-sensitive norms does not develop the systematic comparison that utilitarian analysis requires.

This gap matters because marginal utility differs systematically between income and assets. If empirical evidence establishes that assets beyond a security threshold contribute little to donor welfare while recipients' marginal utility from additional resources remains high, utilitarian calculations may strongly favor asset-based norms. The absence of direct philosophical treatment leaves this possibility unexamined.

### Gap 2: No Defined "Security Threshold" for Assets

Empirical research establishes that assets provide utility through mechanisms distinct from consumption---primarily security, optionality, and stress reduction. Finkelstein, Luttmer, and Notowidigdo (2013) demonstrate that the marginal utility of consumption is state-dependent, varying with health status and implying that assets held for insurance have diminishing marginal value beyond what is needed to cover reasonable risks. Kushlev, Dunn, and Lucas (2015) find that income reduces sadness rather than increasing happiness, suggesting financial resources primarily buffer against negative states rather than generating positive ones. D'Ambrosio, Jantti, and Lepinteur (2019) show wealth provides distinct security benefits beyond what income offers. Tay and colleagues (2016) demonstrate that debt has strongly negative effects on well-being independent of income or gross assets, indicating that net wealth matters crucially for utility.

These findings collectively suggest a threshold hypothesis: assets provide high marginal utility up to some level necessary for financial security---emergency funds, retirement adequacy, insurance against health shocks---but low marginal utility beyond that threshold. Jantsch, Le Blanc, and Schmidt (2024) find that financial assets have stronger well-being effects than real assets, reinforcing the security interpretation. Wiepking and Breeze (2012) show that *subjective* financial security predicts giving behavior more strongly than objective resources, indicating psychological thresholds matter for behavioral compliance as well.

Yet no paper articulates this threshold for giving obligation purposes. Without a defined threshold, asset-based norms risk two failure modes: demanding too much by requiring liquidation of security-providing assets, or permitting too much by allowing indefinite asset accumulation under the guise of precautionary saving. A principled utilitarian analysis requires specifying when assets transition from protected reserves to resources subject to redistribution.

### Gap 3: Unresolved Tension Between Time Neutralism and Patient Philanthropy for Individual Obligations

The philosophical literature on temporal discounting yields a strong case for time neutralism: Greaves (2017) surveys arguments comprehensively and concludes that pure time preference lacks ethical justification, though practical discounting may be warranted by opportunity costs of capital. Greene (2021) defends time neutralism against permissivists, arguing that temporal location should not affect the weight of moral reasons. If temporal location is morally arbitrary, obligations to give from assets in the future are no less weighty than obligations to give from income now.

Patient philanthropy literature, particularly Trammell's (2020) formal models, shows that if investment returns compound faster than the opportunity cost of delay, deferred giving could multiply philanthropic impact dramatically. The Founders Pledge (2021) Patient Philanthropy Fund represents practical implementation of this theory. However, Greaves and MacAskill (2021) argue that the present may constitute a "hinge of history" where current action is uniquely influential, favoring immediate deployment of resources.

The critical gap is that both time neutralism and patient philanthropy focus on institutional fund management, not individual moral obligations. Trammell's models concern how philanthropic vehicles should allocate resources across time; they do not address whether an individual's personal asset accumulation---with vague intention to give later---satisfies the same obligations as regular income-based giving. Time neutralism establishes that future giving has equal moral weight, but this does not determine whether holding assets with intent to give later counts as *currently* fulfilling obligations or merely *deferring* them. The distinction matters enormously for normative guidance: if asset accumulation satisfies obligations, asset-based norms might be *less* demanding than income norms (give later, but more); if it constitutes deferral, asset-holders face ongoing unfulfilled obligations regardless of future intentions.

### Gap 4: Limited Integration Across Domains

The literatures on distributive justice, charitable ethics, and behavioral giving research remain largely separate. Luck egalitarian arguments for wealth taxation---Halliday's (2018) Rignano scheme, Dworkin's (1981) resource egalitarianism---provide normative frameworks for treating inherited wealth differently from earned income, yet these frameworks do not appear in effective altruism literature on giving norms. Murphy and Nagel (2002) argue that pre-tax property rights are "mythical" and all resources are equally available for just redistribution, a radical position that would dissolve the income-wealth distinction entirely---but this view has not been applied to voluntary charitable obligations. Behavioral research on giving predictors (Bekkers and Wiepking 2011; Meer and Priday 2020) shows that income and wealth independently predict giving through different mechanisms, yet this empirical finding rarely informs normative philosophy.

This fragmentation means existing frameworks may already favor asset-based norms---or reveal principled objections---without this being recognized. The taxation literature's epistemological concerns about asset valuation (Delmotte and Cowen 2022) apply equally to voluntary giving but are rarely acknowledged in philosophical discussions. Ring and Thoresen's (2025) finding that wealth taxes *reduce* charitable giving in Norway has important implications for whether asset-based giving norms would face behavioral resistance, yet behavioral evidence is rarely integrated with normative analysis.

### Conclusion

The reviewed literature establishes strong philosophical foundations for utilitarian giving obligations, moderated by legitimate demandingness constraints. Empirical evidence demonstrates systematic differences in how income and assets contribute to well-being: income affects day-to-day consumption and emotional buffering, while assets provide security, optionality, and life-evaluation benefits that may plateau beyond threshold levels (Headey 2019; Kahneman and Deaton 2010; Killingsworth, Kahneman, and Mellers 2023). Temporal considerations complicate rather than resolve the analysis: time neutralism supports equal moral weight for future giving, but whether individual asset accumulation satisfies or defers obligations remains unaddressed.

Current philanthropic practice, centered on income-based norms like Giving What We Can's 10% pledge, lacks principled justification for treating asset accumulation as morally neutral. This may reflect practical considerations---income is easier to measure, automatic deduction is psychologically more tractable, and regular giving may strengthen commitment through habit formation (Andreoni and Serra-Garcia 2017)---rather than utilitarian superiority. The behavioral literature suggests that asset-based giving faces distinct psychological barriers: wealth feels less liquid than income, asset liquidation requires active decisions that can be indefinitely postponed, and subjective financial security mediates the resource-giving relationship (Wiepking and Breeze 2012).

The principal gaps concern: (1) the absence of direct philosophical comparison between income-based and asset-based obligations under consistent utilitarian assumptions; (2) the lack of any specified security threshold distinguishing obligatory giving from protected savings; (3) the unresolved temporal status of individual asset-holding relative to present giving obligations; and (4) insufficient integration of distributive justice frameworks, marginal utility evidence, and behavioral findings.

A systematic analysis addressing these gaps would provide the first principled utilitarian comparison of income-based and asset-based giving norms. Such an analysis would incorporate marginal utility asymmetries documented in empirical literature, develop an explicit threshold model for when assets become subject to obligations, clarify how temporal considerations affect the moral status of asset-holding for individuals, and synthesize normative frameworks across currently fragmented literatures. If asset-based norms prove utilitarian-superior, this would have significant practical implications for how affluent individuals should structure their giving---potentially favoring a self-imposed wealth tax over income tithing, or hybrid approaches that protect security-providing assets while requiring redistribution of excess wealth.
