DOMAIN: Utilitarian Obligations to Charity — Foundational Arguments
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain establishes the core philosophical arguments for why utilitarianism
generates obligations to give to charity. The landscape is dominated by Peter
Singer's 1972 "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," which argues from a simple
utilitarian principle: if we can prevent something bad from happening without
sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. This
argument has generated extensive debate about demandingness, the scope of
beneficence, and the definition of moral obligation. Singer's work has been
refined through discussions of act vs. rule utilitarianism, the role of
impartiality in grounding obligations, and attempts to define "surplus" resources.
Peter Unger's "Living High and Letting Die" (1996) strengthened Singer's argument
through psychological thought experiments. More recent work explores whether
obligations are unconditional or conditional, debates about effective altruism,
and tensions between utilitarian impartiality and special relationships.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the theoretical foundation for the research project's
investigation of income-based vs. asset-based giving norms. Understanding how
utilitarian obligations are justified and what counts as "surplus" resources is
essential for evaluating whether the marginal utility asymmetry between income and
assets matters for these obligations.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While there is extensive work on the stringency of obligations and the role of
impartiality, relatively little addresses the specific question of what resources
agents are obligated to use for beneficence. The definition of "affluence" or
"surplus" tends to remain vague, focusing on income rather than assets or wealth.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish between: (1) the logical structure of Singer's
argument, (2) responses to the demandingness objection, (3) the role of different
forms of utilitarianism, and (4) definitions of surplus resources that ground
giving obligations.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong Singer (8 papers): Obligations are stringent, agent-neutral, based on
  preventing bad outcomes
- Moderate positions (6 papers): Limiting demandingness through fair-share
  principles, collective duties
- Critical perspectives (4 papers): Challenges to utilitarian impartiality,
  structural justice critiques

DOMAIN: Demandingness Objections and Moderate Positions
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 9, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The demandingness objection to consequentialism argues that requiring agents
to always maximize the good is unreasonably stringent. This domain contains
responses from both consequentialists and non-consequentialists. Key debates
include: (1) whether demandingness is genuinely problematic or reflects
misguided intuitions; (2) satisficing vs. maximizing requirements; (3)
agent-relative prerogatives that allow agents to prioritize their own
projects; (4) Murphy's cooperative principle limiting obligations based on
fair share of collective action; (5) scalar consequentialism abandoning
deontic categories entirely; (6) threshold-based approaches specifying how
much sacrifice is too much. Major works include Scheffler (1982) on
agent-centered prerogatives, Kagan (1989) defending stringent demands,
Murphy (2000) on the cooperative principle, Cullity (2004) on iterative
reasoning, and recent work on institutional and scalar responses.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses whether asset-based vs. income-based giving
norms can be normatively defensible if they prove more demanding in
aggregate. Understanding moderate positions (Murphy's cooperative principle,
satisficing, threshold approaches) helps assess which implementation is more
defensible while maintaining utilitarian commitments. The iterative reasoning
problem (Cullity) is especially relevant if asset-based norms create ongoing
demands.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work specifically applying demandingness frameworks to comparative
analysis of different giving implementations (income vs. assets). Most
literature focuses on global poverty in abstract terms rather than
institutional design. Recent institutional consequentialism (Miklos & Tanyi)
under-explored for charitable giving norms.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare Murphy's cooperative principle with satisficing and threshold
approaches. Consider whether asset-based norms violate cooperative fairness
differently than income-based norms. Examine whether scalar approaches
(Norcross) offer resources for comparing implementations without deontic
threshold problems.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Stringent demands (Kagan, Singer): 8 papers - Demandingness not a genuine objection
- Moderate consequentialism (Murphy, Cullity): 4 papers - Cooperation-based or iterative limits
- Agent-relative prerogatives (Scheffler): 3 papers - Non-consequentialist permissions
- Satisficing/Scalar (Slote, Norcross): 3 papers - Alternatives to maximization

DOMAIN: Effective Altruism, Pledges, and Institutionalized Giving Norms
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Effective altruism (EA) emerged in the 2010s as a philosophical movement
and practical framework for optimizing charitable giving. The movement
centers on using reason and evidence to do the most good, often employing
utilitarian calculation to prioritize interventions. Central institutions
like Giving What We Can operationalized EA principles through the 10%
income pledge, creating structured commitment mechanisms for donors.
MacAskill's "Doing Good Better" (2015) established EA's public identity,
emphasizing earning to give, cause prioritization, and evidence-based
charity selection. Recent developments include the rise of longtermism
(MacAskill's "What We Owe the Future," 2022; Greaves & MacAskill 2021),
which extends EA's temporal scope to prioritize far-future generations and
existential risk reduction. Critical scholarship has questioned EA's
ecumenicity (Lim 2019), its neglect of systemic injustice, its elitism
(McLaughlin 2025), and its connections to questionable ideologies (Gebru &
Torres 2024). The domain reveals tension between EA's universalist
aspirations and its specific focus on measurable, quantifiable interventions.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses why EA norms emphasize income-based giving
(10% pledge) rather than asset-based commitments. EA's focus on income
appears partly pragmatic (easier to commit, monitor, and sustain) but also
reflects deeper philosophical commitments to consequentialist calculation,
personal agency in career choice (earning to give), and motivational
sustainability. The longtermist turn raises questions about whether giving
norms should prioritize present poverty relief versus far-future existential
risk mitigation.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Despite extensive literature on effective altruism's philosophy and practice,
there is surprisingly little explicit philosophical justification for why EA
institutions chose income over assets as the basis for giving commitments.
Most discussions treat the 10% income pledge as given rather than as a choice
requiring normative defense. The relationship between EA giving norms and
broader theories of distributive justice (beyond Singer's aid arguments)
remains underdeveloped.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Compare EA's institutionalized income-based norms with the philosophical
foundations in Domain 1 (Singer's arguments could justify either income or
asset-based obligations). Note how EA's emphasis on personal agency and career
choice (earning to give) creates structural bias toward income. Consider whether
longtermism's rise challenges or reinforces income-based giving frameworks.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Foundational EA (MacAskill, Singer): 8 papers - Evidence-based,
  consequentialist optimization of giving
- Longtermist extension (Greaves, Ord, Tarsney): 5 papers - Temporal
  expansion to prioritize far future
- Critical perspectives (Lim, Rubenstein, McLaughlin, Gebru & Torres): 5 papers -
  Questions EA's assumptions, elitism, scope

DOMAIN: Marginal Utility, Diminishing Returns, and Wealth Effects
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 6, Medium: 9, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain encompasses economic and philosophical literature on how utility
varies with income versus wealth. The fundamental question is whether the
marginal utility of income differs systematically from the marginal utility
of wealth, and whether this difference has normative implications for
resource allocation and charitable giving.

The literature establishes several key findings. First, the diminishing
marginal utility of income is well-documented empirically through subjective
well-being studies. Kahneman and Deaton's seminal 2010 study found that
emotional well-being plateaus around $75,000 annual income, though this
finding has been contested and refined by subsequent work (Killingsworth
et al. 2023). Second, wealth appears to have different utility characteristics
than income: Headey (2019) found that wealth influences life satisfaction
more than income in Australia, suggesting that wealth may provide utility
through channels beyond consumption - namely insurance, optionality, and
positional signaling. Third, the relationship between income/wealth and
happiness is complicated by social comparison effects, adaptation, and
cultural factors.

The Easterlin paradox - the observation that happiness does not increase
with long-term economic growth despite strong cross-sectional correlations
between income and happiness - remains contested but influential. Recent
work has attempted to reconcile this paradox by distinguishing between
different components of subjective well-being (affective vs. evaluative)
and by examining satiation points.

Key debates center on: (1) whether there is a satiation point for income's
effect on well-being and where it lies; (2) how wealth effects differ from
income effects; (3) the role of precautionary savings and insurance motives
in explaining wealth accumulation; (4) how positional goods and social
comparison affect the income-happiness relationship.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain is central to the research project's investigation of whether
utilitarian obligations to give should be based on income or assets. If
the marginal utility of wealth is lower than the marginal utility of income
(beyond a reasonable security threshold), then asset-based giving norms
may be morally superior to income-based norms. The empirical evidence on
diminishing marginal utility, precautionary savings motives, and the
wealth-happiness relationship provides the factual foundation for normative
arguments about optimal giving strategies.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

There is limited direct comparison of marginal utility of wealth versus
marginal utility of income. Most studies focus on one or the other. The
literature on precautionary savings provides indirect evidence about wealth's
diminishing marginal utility, but explicit empirical estimates comparing
the two are rare. Additionally, there is limited normative analysis
connecting these empirical findings to charitable giving obligations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Synthesizers should distinguish between: (1) emotional well-being vs. life
evaluation measures; (2) absolute vs. relative income/wealth effects;
(3) different asset classes (financial vs. real assets, liquid vs. illiquid).
The contrast between income-based and wealth-based approaches to utility
should be emphasized, as this directly informs the normative question about
giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Income satiation hypothesis: 8 papers - Emotional well-being plateaus at
  moderate income levels ($75k-$90k)
- Wealth > Income for life satisfaction: 3 papers - Wealth has stronger
  effects on evaluative well-being than income
- Precautionary savings/insurance motives: 4 papers - Wealth provides
  utility through risk reduction beyond consumption
- Positional goods/social comparison: 3 papers - Relative position matters
  more than absolute levels for well-being

DOMAIN: Distributive Justice — Income vs. Wealth Taxation
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses normative philosophical debates about whether redistribution
should target income flows or accumulated wealth/assets. Three major positions emerge:
(1) Luck egalitarians argue that unearned advantages—especially inherited wealth—create
unjust inequalities that should be neutralized through asset taxation; (2) Libertarians
(right and left variants) debate whether wealth accumulation violates self-ownership or
merely reflects historical entitlements; (3) Murphy & Nagel's "conventional ownership"
view rejects pre-tax property rights, treating all taxation as part of a unified
distributive scheme. Recent work by Halliday, Pedersen, and Fleischer explores
inheritance taxation specifically, while Delmotte & Cowen question the technical
feasibility of wealth taxes. The debate intersects with questions about desert (earned
vs. unearned income), responsibility (choice vs. brute luck), and the appropriate
currency of egalitarian justice (resources, welfare, or capabilities).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
While this literature focuses on coercive taxation rather than voluntary giving, it
provides essential normative frameworks for distinguishing income from assets in
distributive schemes. Luck egalitarian arguments about inherited wealth map directly
onto questions about whether utilitarian giving obligations should apply differently to
earned income versus inherited assets. The Murphy-Nagel critique of "everyday
libertarianism" about taxes parallels potential objections to asset-based giving norms.
Debates about the "currency" of justice (income, wealth, opportunities) inform how we
specify what utilitarians have obligations to redistribute.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very little explicit discussion of how these taxation arguments apply to voluntary
charitable redistribution. The literature assumes state coercion; adapting these
frameworks to individual moral obligations requires additional normative work. Also
limited engagement with behavioral dimensions of asset holdings (liquidity constraints,
valuation problems) that would affect giving capacity.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing, contrast luck egalitarian arguments for asset taxation with
libertarian defenses of inheritance rights. Note how Murphy & Nagel dissolve the
income/wealth distinction by denying pre-tax property rights entirely—a radical
position that may have analogs in demanding utilitarian views. Consider whether Rawls's
rejection of inheritance taxes undermines his general egalitarianism.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Luck Egalitarianism (8 papers): Inherited wealth creates unjust inequality; tax unearned advantages
- Libertarianism/Self-Ownership (4 papers): Voluntary transfers respect autonomy; taxation violates rights
- Conventional Ownership (Murphy & Nagel, 2 papers): No pre-tax property rights; income/wealth distinction arbitrary
- Left-Libertarianism (2 papers): Self-ownership compatible with egalitarian distribution of natural resources
- Capability Approach (2 papers): Focus on functionings/opportunities rather than income or wealth per se

DOMAIN: Empirical and Behavioral Research on Charitable Giving
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 10, Medium: 6, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain encompasses empirical and experimental research on charitable giving behavior, with particular focus on how financial resources (income vs. wealth) predict giving. The literature reveals several major streams: (1) demographic and economic predictors of giving, especially the distinct roles of income and wealth; (2) psychological mechanisms driving donation behavior, notably Andreoni's "warm glow" theory alongside pure altruism; (3) experimental studies on commitment devices, pledges, and time-inconsistent giving; (4) tax policy effects and price elasticity of giving.

The Bekkers and Wiepking literature reviews establish that income and wealth have different relationships with giving, with wealth showing stronger associations at higher levels. Meer and Priday's work demonstrates that both income and wealth independently predict giving, but percentage of income given remains relatively flat across income distributions—challenging the common "U-shaped" narrative. The warm-glow literature (Andreoni and followers) shows that donors derive private utility from the act of giving itself, not just from the public good produced, which has important implications for crowding-out effects and tax policy. Recent work on time-inconsistent giving (Andreoni & Serra-Garcia) and pledges reveals that commitment devices can increase giving, though the mechanisms are complex and involve both self-control and social signaling.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the empirical feasibility of asset-based versus income-based giving norms. If wealth and income have different psychological relationships to giving behavior—for instance, if wealth-holders experience different warm-glow effects or face different psychological barriers—this would affect which norm is more psychologically sustainable. The experimental literature on commitment devices is especially relevant for understanding whether either type of norm could be effectively implemented.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Very little research directly compares giving from liquid income versus illiquid assets, or examines how asset composition affects donation behavior. Most studies treat "wealth" as a composite variable without distinguishing between housing wealth, financial assets, and liquid savings. Additionally, experimental work on commitment devices has not been extended to long-term asset-based giving strategies.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Integration with philosophical domains should examine whether empirical patterns of giving align with or challenge utilitarian prescriptions. The warm-glow findings suggest that purely consequentialist arguments may be insufficient; psychological sustainability requires accounting for donors' intrinsic motivation. The wealth-income distinction in empirical data should inform debates about which baseline (income vs. assets) is more psychologically tractable.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Income/wealth predictors (8 papers): Separate effects of income and wealth on giving likelihood and amounts
- Warm-glow vs. pure altruism (5 papers): Psychological mechanisms and their policy implications
- Commitment devices and pledges (3 papers): Experimental evidence on time-inconsistent giving

DOMAIN: Time Preference, Investment, and Deferred Giving
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-07
PAPERS_FOUND: 15 total (High: 6, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, EA Forum, 80,000 Hours
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses whether resources should be donated now or invested
for later giving—a critical tension between present and future obligations
in utilitarian philanthropy. The debate centers on three core issues: (1) the
philosophical justification for time preference and temporal discounting in
utilitarian calculations; (2) empirical questions about expected returns from
giving now versus investing; and (3) the role of uncertainty and option value
in timing decisions.

Foundational work on intergenerational ethics and time discounting (Ramsey,
Sidgwick, Pigou) provides the classical utilitarian framework that treats
temporal location as morally irrelevant—the "zero time preference" view.
This view has been challenged on both ethical grounds (Heath argues for
positive social time preference; Preston Greene defends time neutralism)
and practical grounds (Greaves surveys discounting in public policy; Stern
and Zuber & Fleurbaey analyze intergenerational welfare economics).

The effective altruism movement revived these debates through the concept
of "patient philanthropy" (Trammell). If investment returns compound faster
than the opportunity cost of delay, deferred giving could multiply impact
dramatically. However, this conflicts with the "hinge of history" hypothesis
(Ord, MacAskill & Greaves) that the present moment may be uniquely pivotal.
The debate extends to practical giving norms: MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord
propose income-based tithing as a demanding but achievable standard, while
Madoff & Soskis explore temporal considerations in philanthropic structures
more broadly.

Recent work examines how uncertainty affects timing: option value arguments
suggest that preserving flexibility by waiting can be rational even if
expected returns favor immediate giving. This connects directly to whether
asset-holding (with intent to give later) satisfies the same moral
obligations as income-based giving now.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is essential to the research question of income-based versus
asset-based giving norms. If patient philanthropy is justified, then
holding assets with intent to give later could be morally equivalent to
or even superior to giving from income now. The literature on time
preference reveals whether the temporal dimension of assets (as deferred
giving) creates distinct moral obligations compared to income flows.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively debates the ethics of discounting future
benefits, there is surprisingly little work on the ethics of discounting
future obligations. Most patient philanthropy arguments focus on maximizing
impact, not on whether timing affects when obligations are discharged.
Additionally, few papers address how uncertainty about one's own future
wealth or charitable intentions should affect the give-now versus give-later
calculation.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should distinguish three levels of analysis: (1) pure time
preference (is temporal location per se morally relevant?); (2) investment
returns and compounding (do practical considerations favor delay?); and
(3) uncertainty and option value (how should we act under radical
uncertainty about the future?). This domain reveals that the case for
asset-based norms depends heavily on empirical claims about investment
returns and philosophical claims about our epistemic access to future needs.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Time neutralism (0% pure discounting): 4 papers - Classical utilitarian
  view that temporal location is morally irrelevant (Ramsey, Sidgwick,
  Greaves, Preston Greene)
- Positive time preference justification: 3 papers - Arguments that some
  discounting is ethically warranted (Heath, Stern, Zuber & Fleurbaey)
- Patient philanthropy: 5 papers - Case for investing to give later
  (Trammell, Founders Pledge, EA Forum discussions)
- Hinge of history: 3 papers - Present is uniquely important, favoring
  giving now (Ord, MacAskill & Greaves on longtermism, Mogensen replies)

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening
  without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought morally
  to do it. Applied to world poverty, this generates stringent obligations for
  affluent individuals to donate substantial portions of their income to famine
  relief and poverty reduction. The argument relies on a utilitarian principle
  combined with the empirical claim that donations can effectively prevent
  suffering. Singer contends that distance and proximity are morally irrelevant—
  our duty to save a drowning child nearby is the same as our duty to save
  distant strangers through charitable giving.

  RELEVANCE: This is the foundational text for utilitarian arguments about
  charitable giving. The research project investigates income vs. asset-based
  giving norms, and Singer's argument implicitly focuses on disposable income as
  the resource from which giving obligations derive. Understanding how Singer
  defines "comparable moral importance" and what resources are considered
  "sacrificable" is essential for evaluating whether income and assets should be
  treated differently in utilitarian frameworks.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and strengthens Singer's argument through vivid thought
  experiments designed to overcome psychological resistance to utilitarian
  conclusions about giving. Unger presents cases (like the Vintage Sedan case)
  where readers intuitively judge that we must sacrifice valuable possessions to
  save lives, then argues these intuitions extend to distant poverty. He contends
  that psychological factors—not genuine moral considerations—explain why people
  resist Singer's conclusions. The book systematically addresses objections about
  causal efficacy, collective action, and the demandingness of utilitarian duties.

  RELEVANCE: Unger's argument directly addresses the question of what resources
  we must sacrifice. His Vintage Sedan example involves giving up an asset (a
  car) rather than income, potentially supporting asset-based giving obligations.
  However, the psychological focus may obscure whether there are genuine moral
  differences between types of resources. The project's investigation of marginal

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that Singer's demanding conclusions can be resisted
  without rejecting the underlying utilitarian principle. Cullity introduces a
  distinction between "direct" duties (to particular individuals we encounter) and
  "collective" duties (to contribute our fair share to collective efforts). He
  contends that while we have stringent direct duties to help those we can
  directly save, our duties regarding distant poverty are better understood as
  fair-share contributions to collective relief efforts. This limits demandingness
  while retaining the core insight that we have obligations to help.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's fair-share approach could ground different treatment of
  income vs. assets. If fair shares are calculated based on comparative wealth
  rather than absolute ability to give, asset holdings might matter independently
  of income. However, Cullity doesn't develop this possibility. The project could
  explore whether marginal utility differences between income and assets justify
  different fair-share calculations.

  doi = {10.1086/652294},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the traditional distinction between negative duties
  (not to harm) and positive duties (to aid) by introducing the concept of "new
  harms"—harms that arise from our participation in global institutional
  structures. Lichtenberg argues that through consumption, trade, and political
  participation, affluent individuals contribute causally to global poverty. This
  transforms what appears to be a positive duty to aid into a negative duty to
  stop harming. The distinction matters because negative duties are typically
  considered more stringent and less subject to demandingness worries.

  RELEVANCE: Lichtenberg's argument could ground stronger obligations than
  Singer's beneficence-based approach. If giving is required to compensate for
  harm we cause through institutional participation, the question shifts from
  "how much surplus can we afford to give?" to "how much must we give to
  discharge our duty not to harm?" This reframes the income vs. assets question:
  if duties derive from harm, perhaps assets accumulated through harmful systems
  have different status than current income.

  doi = {10.1007/978-3-319-41430-0_12},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques Singer's charitable giving approach for treating
  poverty as a humanitarian crisis requiring individual beneficence rather than
  as structural injustice requiring institutional change. Kahn argues that
  Singer's utilitarian framework obscures the political nature of poverty and
  misdirects moral energy toward charity rather than advocacy and political
  action. She contends that individuals have "collectivization duties" to work
  toward establishing just institutions, not merely duties to donate to effective
  charities. This challenges Singer's assumption that maximizing welfare through
  donations is the primary moral requirement.

  RELEVANCE: Kahn's critique raises questions about whether utilitarian
  obligations should focus on individual consumption and giving at all. If duties
  are primarily political, the income vs. assets distinction may be less
  important than questions about political participation and institutional
  reform. However, even granting political duties, residual beneficence
  obligations may remain, and the project's analysis could apply to those.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between Singer's original argument and
  Unger's refinement, noting that both share a commitment to consequentialist
  impartiality but differ in rhetorical strategy. Jamieson explores the tension
  between theoretical consistency (which would demand very high levels of
  sacrifice) and practical efficacy (which might require more moderate demands to
  avoid demotivating potential donors). He suggests that rule consequentialism
  might justify less demanding giving standards if demanding standards would
  reduce overall compliance and thus total welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Jamieson's discussion of rule vs. act consequentialism is directly
  relevant to asset vs. income norms. Even if act consequentialism demands equal
  treatment of income and assets, rule consequentialism might justify differential
  treatment if asset-based norms would generate resistance and reduce total
  giving. The project should consider whether the marginal utility asymmetry
  justifies asset-favoring rules on act-consequentialist grounds or only on

  year = {2004},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a sophisticated defense of moderate beneficence
  requirements against both Singer-style demanding consequentialism and libertarian
  minimalism. Cullity argues that while we have significant duties to help others,
  these duties are limited by the "life-project constraint"—the idea that morality
  cannot require abandoning our own valuable projects and relationships. He
  develops a complex account of when helping others would constitute an
  unacceptable sacrifice, attempting to navigate between demanding and lax
  positions while respecting both utilitarian and non-consequentialist intuitions.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's life-project constraint raises questions about different
  types of resources. Long-term projects often depend more on asset security
  (home ownership, retirement savings) than on current income. If protecting
  life projects justifies limiting giving obligations, this might justify treating
  assets differently from income. The marginal utility analysis could provide
  utilitarian grounds for Cullity's non-utilitarian constraint.

  POSITION: Moderate position balancing beneficence demands with personal

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends a moderate giving principle that requires significant but
  not maximally demanding sacrifice from affluent individuals. Robson argues that
  while Singer's principle is too demanding (requiring sacrifice up to the point
  of marginal utility), a minimal principle is insufficient. He proposes that we
  should give until helping others would require sacrificing something
  "substantially important" to us—more than mere preferences but less than
  everything of comparable value. This attempts to capture common-sense morality
  while acknowledging significant duties to the global poor.

  RELEVANCE: Robson's principle of "substantial importance" requires criteria for
  what makes a sacrifice substantial. The income vs. assets distinction could
  matter here: sacrificing retirement security (assets) might be "substantially
  important" even when the financial value equals income that would not be.
  Marginal utility differences could provide utilitarian grounds for this
  intuition, showing that asset sacrifice has different welfare impacts than
  income sacrifice.

  obligations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides a comprehensive overview of utilitarian approaches to
  poverty obligations, distinguishing unconditional obligations (which hold
  regardless of what others do) from conditional obligations (which depend on
  institutions or others' compliance). Berkey argues that much recent debate
  concerns whether utilitarian giving obligations are best understood as
  unconditional duties to maximize good or as conditional fair-share
  contributions. He notes that this distinction affects how demanding obligations
  are and how they interact with political and institutional duties.

  RELEVANCE: The unconditional vs. conditional distinction affects how income and
  assets should be treated. Unconditional maximizing duties would treat all
  resources identically (give from whichever source maximizes welfare).
  Conditional fair-share duties might differentiate based on social norms or
  institutional roles (e.g., income taxes vs. wealth taxes). The project should

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Review and critical analysis of Peter Singer's book advancing
  effective altruism. Timmerman examines Singer's argument that we should not only
  give to charity but give to the most effective charities (those that produce the
  most good per dollar). This extends Singer's original 1972 argument by adding
  optimization requirements. The effective altruism movement emphasizes measuring
  impact, considering opportunity costs, and treating cause-selection as a moral
  choice comparable to donation amounts.

  RELEVANCE: Effective altruism's focus on optimizing impact could support
  asset-based norms if liquidating assets and donating proceeds produces more good
  than donating equivalent amounts of income. However, the movement typically
  focuses on income pledges (e.g., "give 10% of income"). The project investigates
  whether this income focus is justified or whether marginal utility considerations
  favor asset-based approaches instead.

  doi = {10.1007/S10790-016-9552-Y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Grounds duties to aid in human rights rather than utilitarian
  beneficence, arguing that subsistence rights generate collective obligations
  that should be distributed fairly among duty-bearers. Igneski contends that
  rights-based approaches avoid demandingness problems that plague utilitarian
  accounts because rights claims can be limited by fair distribution principles.
  She develops an account of how collective duties translate into individual
  responsibilities without requiring each person to do everything possible to
  fulfill rights.

  RELEVANCE: While not strictly utilitarian, Igneski's fair-share approach to
  distributing collective duties could inform utilitarian frameworks. If fair
  shares are calculated based on capacity to contribute, the income vs. assets
  distinction matters for determining capacity. Asset-rich but income-poor
  individuals might have different fair shares than income-rich but asset-poor
  individuals, even with identical net worth.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Garrett Cullity's concept of fairness as "appropriate
  impartiality" and argues that vagueness in this concept makes it vulnerable to
  self-serving bias. Newey draws on psychological research showing that when moral
  concepts are vague, people unconsciously interpret them in self-favoring ways.
  This threatens Cullity's attempt to use fairness to limit Singer's demanding
  conclusions—we may convince ourselves we're being fair while actually being
  self-serving.

  RELEVANCE: The self-serving bias problem applies to any attempt to define
  "surplus" resources or determine when giving would require "too much" sacrifice.
  If income vs. assets norms differ, people might self-servingly classify
  resources in whichever category demands less. The project should address whether

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reexamines Singer's claim that spatial distance is morally
  irrelevant to beneficence duties. While accepting that distance itself doesn't
  matter morally, Binder and Heilmann argue that distance correlates with
  epistemically relevant factors—we know more about local needs and can more
  reliably help nearby. This challenges Singer's implicit assumption that we can
  help distant strangers as effectively as those near us, potentially limiting the
  scope of demanding obligations.

  RELEVANCE: The epistemic dimension of effectiveness could affect income vs.
  assets considerations. We may have better information about our long-term needs
  (requiring asset protection) than about optimal charitable allocations. If
  epistemic uncertainty should moderate giving obligations, this might justify
  retaining assets for possible future needs even when current income suggests we
  could give more. However, this seems to favor caution rather than systematic
  asset preference.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that consequentialist evaluation of charitable/ethical
  consumption should include indirect effects on other agents' behavior. Walton
  contends that purchasing Fair Trade goods, even if less directly effective than
  donating equivalent money to GiveWell-recommended charities, may be justified by
  indirect effects: encouraging others to also support Fair Trade, building
  social movements, changing norms. This suggests consequentialism should consider
  systemic and motivational effects beyond direct impact.

  RELEVANCE: Walton's indirect effects argument could apply to giving norms
  themselves. An asset-based norm might have better indirect effects than an
  income-based norm if it's more psychologically sustainable, generates less
  resistance, or builds stronger pro-giving cultural attitudes. The project should
  consider whether marginal utility differences justify asset-based norms directly

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the psychological measurement of utilitarian moral
  judgment, arguing that "impartial beneficence" (one dimension of the Oxford
  Utilitarianism Scale) is not distinctively utilitarian. Mihailov contends that
  Kantian ethics equally supports all-encompassing impartial concern for others'
  welfare. This suggests that debates about utilitarian giving obligations may
  actually concern broader questions about the demands of impartial morality
  rather than specifically utilitarian commitments.

  RELEVANCE: If impartial beneficence is shared across ethical frameworks, the
  income vs. assets question may not depend on utilitarian calculations alone.
  Different frameworks might reach similar conclusions about asset-based norms for
  different reasons (e.g., Kantian respect for rational agency might protect
  asset-based security differently than utilitarian welfare calculations). The

  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive treatment of prioritarianism—the view that benefits
  to worse-off individuals matter more morally than equal benefits to better-off
  individuals. Arneson distinguishes prioritarianism from utilitarianism
  (impartial but non-weighted) and egalitarianism (focused on reducing inequality
  rather than maximizing weighted welfare). He argues that prioritarianism
  provides the best consequentialist framework for beneficence, avoiding both
  utilitarianism's indifference to distribution and egalitarianism's sometimes
  perverse implications.

  RELEVANCE: Prioritarianism affects how giving obligations are calculated. Under
  pure utilitarianism, we should give until marginal utility of retained income
  equals marginal utility of donated income (the point Singer identifies). Under
  prioritarianism, we should give more because benefits to worse-off recipients
  receive extra weight. This could affect income vs. assets differentially: if
  asset-based security has especially high priority-weighted value,
  prioritarianism might justify retaining assets while giving income.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental evidence that veil-of-ignorance reasoning (asking

  utilitarian/greater-good thinking. Huang et al. show that veil reasoning
  increases support for utilitarian choices in dilemmas, effective charity
  donation, and autonomous vehicle policies that minimize total harm. This
  suggests impartiality mechanisms can overcome psychological resistance to
  utilitarian conclusions, supporting Singer's argumentative strategy.

  RELEVANCE: The veil-of-ignorance approach could test intuitions about income vs.
  assets. Behind the veil, not knowing whether we'll be asset-rich or income-rich,
  what giving norms would we choose? If marginal utility differences are real,
  veil reasoning might favor asset-protecting norms. However, if differences are

  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study finding that lay people rarely make genuinely
  utilitarian (outcome-maximizing) decisions in allocation tasks. Instead, they
  prefer equality-based distributions and, when they do maximize outcomes, it's
  usually to minimize harm rather than maximize benefits. Crucially, outcome
  maximization is often partial (favoring in-groups) rather than impartial. This
  challenges assumptions that utilitarian reasoning is intuitive or that people
  actually reason as Singer's argument requires.

  RELEVANCE: If genuine impartial beneficence is psychologically rare or
  difficult, this affects the feasibility of different giving norms. An
  asset-based norm might be more sustainable if it aligns better with
  psychological tendencies (protecting one's own future security). Alternatively,
  if the problem is partiality rather than the form of obligation, income vs.
  assets distinctions won't solve motivational problems. The project should

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces agent-centered prerogatives allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own projects and interests without violating morality. Argues that consequentialism's demand to maximize impartial good fails to respect the independence of the personal point of view. Proposes a hybrid theory incorporating both consequentialist and deontological elements, where agents have permission (but not requirement) to favor their own concerns up to a certain degree.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding moderate positions that limit utilitarian demands. If agent-relative prerogatives are defensible, both income and asset-based norms must respect agents' ability to pursue personal projects. The question becomes which implementation better balances personal prerogatives against beneficence obligations, and whether asset liquidation demands respect or violate such prerogatives more severely than income sacrifice.

If Kagan is correct that demandingness objections are misguided, then the mere fact that asset-based norms demand more aggregate sacrifice than income-based norms does not count against them.

Argues this avoids extreme demands without abandoning consequentialism's fundamental insights. Distinguishes ideal theory (full compliance) from nonideal theory (partial compliance) and contends that most demandingness objections mistakenly apply ideal theory standards to nonideal conditions.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to comparing income vs. asset-based giving norms. If most affluent people don't comply with giving obligations, Murphy's principle limits individual obligations to fair share contributions. The question becomes whether fair shares should be calculated based on income or assets, and whether asset-based norms require excessive individual sacrifice to compensate for collective failures.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a "realm-based" consequentialism dividing moral life into distinct realms (subsistence, survival, sacrifice) governed by different principles. In subsistence realm, demands are moderate; in survival realm where basic needs are threatened, demands become more stringent; in sacrifice realm, supererogatory acts are encouraged but not required. Rejects both Scheffler's hybrid theory and Slote's satisficing consequentialism as inadequate solutions to demandingness.

  RELEVANCE: The realm-based approach offers a framework for assessing whether asset liquidation crosses boundaries between moral realms. Income-based norms might remain in subsistence realm, while asset-based norms requiring liquidation could enter sacrifice realm. Mulgan's framework suggests different moral principles apply in different contexts, potentially supporting income-based norms if asset demands exceed subsistence realm boundaries.

  RELEVANCE: This seminal article provides the theoretical foundation for limiting giving demands based on fairness considerations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that the demandingness objection cannot provide independent grounds for rejecting consequentialism because it presupposes prior commitments to non-consequentialist values. The objection's force depends on antecedent beliefs about agent-relative prerogatives or personal cost thresholds that consequentialism rejects. Thus the objection begs the question against consequentialism rather than providing neutral grounds for its rejection.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges whether aggregate demandingness provides genuine grounds for preferring income-based over asset-based norms from within utilitarian framework. If Sobel is correct, the mere fact that asset-based norms are more demanding cannot ground a utilitarian argument against them; demandingness concerns must be independently justified. This suggests focusing on other considerations (efficiency, compliance, collective action) rather than demandingness per se when comparing implementations.

Distinguishes demandingness from related objections (alienation, integrity, special relationships). Argues rule consequentialism offers superior response to demandingness than act-consequentialist strategies, since internalized rules can limit demands while maintaining consequentialist foundations.

  RELEVANCE: Rule consequentialism may support different giving norms than act consequentialism. If internalized income-based norms produce better overall consequences than internalized asset-based norms (due to compliance, psychological effects, social coordination), rule consequentialism favors income-based implementation even if asset-based would be superior in individual cases.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends scalar consequentialism which abandons deontic categories (right/wrong, obligatory/supererogatory) in favor of purely comparative rankings of actions by their consequences. Actions are simply better or worse than alternatives, providing stronger or weaker reasons. This avoids arbitrary threshold-setting problems that plague both maximizing and satisficing approaches, and eliminates demandingness objections that presuppose deontic distinctions.

  RELEVANCE: Scalar approach potentially dissolves the question of whether asset-based norms are "too demanding" by rejecting the obligatory/supererogatory distinction entirely. Instead of asking which norm is obligatory, scalar framework asks which norm provides stronger reasons relative to alternatives. This may support nuanced comparison: asset-based norms provide stronger reasons when assets are easily liquid, weaker reasons when liquidation is costly. Avoids problematic threshold-setting.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes novel "willpower satisficing" view requiring agents to produce as much good as they can given their actual level of effort expenditure, with an effort ceiling limiting required willpower. Argues this avoids Bradley's objection about gratuitous prevention of goodness while still reducing demandingness. The effort threshold is specified via independent theory of blameworthiness rather than arbitrary stipulation.

  RELEVANCE: Willpower framework may distinguish income vs. asset-based norms based on differential effort costs. If asset liquidation requires substantially more willpower/effort than income donation (due to psychological attachment, transaction costs, irreversibility), willpower satisficing might support income-based norms as appropriately demanding given realistic effort constraints. However, this depends on empirical claims about relative effort costs of different giving implementations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops institutional consequentialism as response to demandingness objection. Argues institutions should bear the consequentialist burden of maximizing good, while individuals are required primarily to establish and maintain appropriate institutions. In special occasions where institutions fail, individuals face more stringent demands, but normal circumstances involve moderate institution-supporting obligations rather than constant maximization.

  RELEVANCE: Suggests giving norms should be institutionalized rather than imposed on individuals directly. Both income-based and asset-based norms could be implemented through tax policy, charitable deduction structures, or wealth tax institutions. Institutional approach may support income-based norms if income taxation is more feasible institutionally than asset taxation, or support asset-based norms if wealth taxation better achieves collective goals. Shifts focus from individual demands to institutional design.

  POSITION: Institutional consequentialism; assigns consequentialist burden primarily to institutions rather than individual agents.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "weak anti-rationalism"—the view that moral requirements need not provide overriding reasons for action—as response to demandingness. Argues that even if morality demands significant sacrifice, this doesn't entail that agents have decisive reason to comply. Distinguishes normative authority of moral requirements from their rational force, allowing morality to be demanding without being rationally tyrannical.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative framework for assessing demandingness: even if asset-based norms demand more than income-based norms, this may not generate stronger all-things-considered reasons for action. Allows utilitarian defense of stringent norms while acknowledging their demands may sometimes be outweighed by other considerations. However, this meta-ethical move may seem to undermine moral requirements' practical significance for guiding behavior.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues demandingness intuitions are unreliable because they're influenced by self-serving bias, status quo bias, and salience effects. Empirical evidence suggests people's judgments about what's too demanding are systematically distorted by motivated reasoning and cognitive biases favoring their current behavior. Therefore demandingness intuitions should not be given significant weight in moral theorizing.

  RELEVANCE: If demandingness intuitions are unreliable, this undermines objections to asset-based norms based on their seeming excessively demanding. People may judge asset liquidation as too demanding due to bias toward protecting their own wealth rather than legitimate moral concerns. However, this empirical debunking strategy cuts both ways: compliance and feasibility considerations for implementation may still favor less demanding income-based norms even if demandingness intuitions per se are unreliable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "moving band" approach to agent-relative permissions, where the stringency of obligations varies with how much good is at stake. When small amounts of good are achievable, agents have wide permissions to prioritize personal concerns; when large amounts of good are at stake, permissions narrow and obligations become more stringent. This creates a variable threshold rather than fixed agent-relative prerogative or constant maximization requirement.

  RELEVANCE: Moving band approach suggests obligations to give from assets vs. income should depend on amounts of good achievable. If asset-based giving produces significantly more good for beneficiaries, permissions narrow and asset obligations become more stringent. If incremental good from asset-based norms is modest, permissions remain wide and income-based norms suffice. This context-sensitive approach avoids both extreme demands and inadequate response, but requires empirical assessment of relative impact.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines effective altruism movement's relationship to consequentialism and demandingness. Argues most EA understandings imply consequentialism, though EA advocates often deny requiring maximization. Contends that claim to maximize good is not essential to consequentialism; what's essential is view that producing more good is always morally better. Argues standard demandingness objection misses target by focusing on maximization requirement rather than this core comparative claim.

  RELEVANCE: EA movement's practical implementation of utilitarian giving provides empirical test case for comparing income vs. asset-based norms. Most EA recommendations focus on income percentages (e.g., 10% pledge, Singer's graduated scale) rather than asset liquidation, suggesting income-based norms are more practically implemented. However, Lichtenberg's analysis shows this may reflect pragmatic concession rather than theoretical justification. Highlights gap between utilitarian theory and EA practice.

  doi = {10.26556/jesp.v10i1.182},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that satisficing and scalar consequentialism are not genuinely less demanding than maximizing consequentialism because they maintain that agents have most reason to maximize the good. Even if these theories don't classify suboptimal acts as "wrong," they still judge agents morally criticizable for failing to maximize. Thus alternative consequentialist theories don't escape demandingness despite rejecting maximization requirement.

  RELEVANCE: If Case is correct that alternative consequentialist frameworks remain effectively as demanding as maximizing consequentialism, then neither satisficing nor scalar approaches provide theoretical resources for defending income-based norms as less demanding than asset-based norms. This pushes toward either accepting stringent asset-based demands or adopting non-consequentialist moderate positions (agent-relative prerogatives, Murphy's cooperation). Suggests demandingness problem is deeper than structure of consequentialist theory.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces effective altruism to general audiences, arguing that charitable giving should be optimized through evidence and reason to maximize impact. Develops the case for earning to give (choosing high-income careers to donate more), cause prioritization (focusing on neglected, tractable problems), and using cost-effectiveness analysis to select charities. Presents the framework that would become institutionalized through organizations like Giving What We Can.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing EA's practical norms, including the emphasis on income-based giving commitments. The "earning to give" framework inherently privileges income over assets as the relevant measure for moral obligation. Essential for understanding why EA institutions structured pledges around income percentage rather than wealth percentage. MacAskill's framework treats current income as the primary locus of moral agency, which shapes subsequent norm design.

Provides philosophical grounding for EA's evidence-based approach and introduces the effective altruism movement to philosophical audiences.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges Singer's foundational philosophical work on aid obligations with the institutionalized EA movement.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops longtermism as an extension of effective altruism, arguing that positively influencing the long-term future should be a key moral priority. Contends that the potential value of the far future (billions of future people over millions of years) vastly outweighs present concerns, implying we should prioritize existential risk reduction and trajectory changes over near-term poverty relief. Introduces concepts of lock-in, value drift, and moral importance of future generations.

  RELEVANCE: Represents a major evolution in EA thinking with direct implications for giving norms. If longtermism is correct, income-based pledges focused on global poverty may be misallocated; resources should instead flow to AI safety, biosecurity, and other existential risk work. The temporal extension challenges whether EA's institutionalized giving structures (designed for evaluable, near-term charities) remain appropriate.

Provides quantitative estimates of extinction probabilities and argues for institutional responses to safeguard humanity's long-term trajectory.

  RELEVANCE: Complements MacAskill's longtermism with focus on specific existential risks. Relevant to the research project because Ord's framework suggests charitable resources should prioritize existential risk reduction over poverty relief, challenging the income-pledge model designed for near-term global health interventions. The emphasis on institutional and policy work (rather than individual donations) may also challenge income-based individual pledges as the optimal giving structure.

Argues this follows from plausible axiological claims about the moral importance of future people combined with empirical claims about our ability to predictably influence the far future. Distinguishes between axiological and deontic versions of longtermism.

  RELEVANCE: The most rigorous philosophical statement of longtermism's core thesis. Directly relevant because if strong longtermism is correct, EA's income-pledge model focused on GiveWell-recommended charities may be fundamentally misguided. The paper's focus on what is "best overall" rather than "what satisfies our obligations" also has implications for whether giving norms should be framed as duties (like pledges) or optimization targets.

  RELEVANCE: Represents major internal critique within EA/longtermism debate. Relevant to research project because epistemic challenges to longtermism strengthen the case for near-term, measurable interventions (where income-pledge model was designed).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruism's claim to be ecumenical toward different moral views is inconsistent with its criticisms of charities that do not maximize measurable welfare. Contends that individuals with different moral commitments (e.g., special duties to compatriots, emphasis on rights rather than welfare) may justifiably support charities that EA dismisses as ineffective. EA's evidence-based framework privileges utilitarian maximization over other legitimate moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Key critique of EA's foundational assumptions with implications for giving norm design. If EA is not genuinely ecumenical, its income-pledge model embodies specifically utilitarian commitments rather than universally compelling moral requirements. This challenges whether EA-style giving norms should be presented as what "we" ought to do versus what utilitarians specifically should do.

  RELEVANCE: Important early critique highlighting what EA's income-pledge model neglects: questions of how wealth was acquired, systemic causes of poverty, and political obligations distinct from charitable aid. Relevant because the choice between income-based and asset-based norms may implicate different theories of justice (income reflects recent productive contribution; assets may reflect historical injustice).

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the drowning child thought experiment from "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" to argue that affluent individuals have strong moral obligations to donate to effective poverty-relief charities. Provides a sliding scale of recommended giving percentages based on income, with higher earners expected to give proportionally more. Emphasizes that even modest sacrifices from the wealthy could prevent enormous suffering.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding EA's income-based giving norms. Singer's sliding scale explicitly ties obligations to income levels rather than wealth or assets.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses practical questions about EA giving norms beyond the simple "10% of income" pledge. The temporal dimension (give now vs. later) interacts with the income vs. assets question: if you should invest and give later, this implies assets (investment principal) become morally relevant, not just current income.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence that longtermist beliefs motivate action, relevant for assessing whether longtermist giving norms can sustain long-term commitment. If longtermism enhances motivation, this bears on the research question: perhaps income-based pledges work because they align with EA's temporal framing, while asset-based norms might require different motivational structures.

Questions whether the value of creating happy people justifies longtermist priorities.

  RELEVANCE: Internal EA/longtermist debate about population ethics with implications for giving priorities. If longtermism does not require creating vast future populations, this affects what causes deserve funding (shifting from existential risk to quality of future lives).

  CORE ARGUMENT: This seminal paper distinguishes between two aspects of
  subjective well-being: emotional well-being (daily happiness, stress,
  sadness) and life evaluation (overall life satisfaction). Using Gallup
  data on 450,000 US residents, the authors find that while life evaluation
  rises consistently with income, emotional well-being plateaus at
  approximately $75,000 annual income. Beyond this threshold, higher income
  buys life satisfaction but not happiness.

  RELEVANCE: This finding is crucial for understanding diminishing marginal
  utility of income. The satiation point for emotional well-being suggests
  that for individuals above $75k, additional income has sharply diminishing
  returns for experienced utility. This directly supports the argument that
  high-income individuals should give more, as their marginal utility of
  income is lower. However, the continued rise in life evaluation suggests
  income still provides some utility even at high levels, possibly through
  positional or aspirational channels.

  POSITION: Income satiation hypothesis. The dual-component model of
  well-being is foundational for understanding the income-happiness
  relationship.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper resolves the apparent contradiction between
  Kahneman-Deaton (2010) and Killingsworth (2021) regarding income
  satiation. Through joint reanalysis, the authors find that the flattening
  pattern exists but is restricted to the least happy 20% of the population.
  For most people, happiness continues to rise with log(income) without
  satiation. The discrepancy arose from methodological choices in data
  analysis that should be questioned more often.

  RELEVANCE: This significantly revises the income satiation thesis. If
  emotional well-being continues to rise with income for 80% of people
  (albeit logarithmically), then the case for sharply diminishing marginal
  utility of income is weaker than Kahneman-Deaton suggested. However, the
  logarithmic relationship still implies diminishing returns, and the
  finding that unhappy people experience satiation is important for
  understanding heterogeneity in utility functions.

  POSITION: Qualified satiation hypothesis. Challenges the universal
  satiation point but confirms logarithmic (diminishing) returns and
  satiation for unhappiest quintile.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using household panel data from Australia, Britain, and
  Germany, this paper demonstrates that household wealth has a stronger

  Wealth appears to provide security, options, and social status that

  RELEVANCE: This is perhaps the most directly relevant paper for the
  project's central question. If wealth has stronger effects on life

  provide mainly positional or optional benefits (rather than consumption
  utility), this supports asset-based giving norms. The finding challenges

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive study examines the relationship between

  components of wealth affect well-being. If financial assets have
  diminishing marginal utility while providing mainly insurance value, this
  strengthens the case for asset-based giving. The decomposition into
  wealth components helps identify which assets contribute most to utility

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper revisits the Easterlin paradox - the observation
  that while richer people are happier than poorer people within countries,
  average happiness does not increase as countries grow richer over time.
  The authors confirm this pattern across 37 countries over recent decades,
  arguing that happiness depends on relative rather than absolute income.
  Adaptation and social comparison explain why rising incomes don't increase
  happiness in the long run.

  RELEVANCE: The Easterlin paradox has important implications for
  understanding diminishing marginal utility. If happiness depends largely
  on relative position, then redistribution could increase total utility
  even without changing absolute consumption levels. This supports
  progressive giving norms. However, if the paradox primarily reflects
  adaptation rather than social comparison, the implications for giving
  are less clear.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review examines the determinants of
  subjective well-being, with particular attention to income, unemployment,
  health, and social relationships. The authors synthesize extensive
  empirical evidence showing that income has significant but diminishing
  effects on happiness, and that unemployment and poor health have large
  negative effects. Social comparison and adaptation are key mechanisms
  mediating the income-happiness relationship.

  RELEVANCE: This review provides essential context for understanding how
  income affects well-being relative to other factors. The finding that
  income's effect is significant but smaller than health and social
  relationships suggests that focusing solely on financial resources may
  miss important dimensions of utility. For utilitarian giving norms, this
  raises questions about whether donations should target income/wealth

  CORE ARGUMENT: This chapter examines the effect of income on happiness
  using longitudinal data from Britain, Germany, and Australia. While
  confirming that income affects happiness, the authors emphasize the
  importance of social comparisons and adaptation in mediating this
  relationship. They find that changes in income matter more than levels,
  and that the income-happiness gradient varies across individuals and
  contexts.

  RELEVANCE: The emphasis on income changes rather than levels has important
  implications for giving norms. If adaptation is strong, then the
  disutility from giving (reducing one's income) may be temporary, while
  the utility gain for recipients may also diminish over time. This
  complicates utilitarian calculations about optimal giving levels.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper estimates how health status affects the marginal
  utility of consumption using data on life insurance holdings. The authors
  find that worse health is associated with lower marginal utility of
  consumption, suggesting that health and consumption are complements. This
  has important implications for optimal insurance and savings, as it means
  the value of wealth is state-dependent.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on health rather than wealth per se, this paper
  demonstrates that marginal utility is context-dependent and can vary
  across states of the world. If marginal utility of consumption decreases
  when health is poor, this suggests that assets held for insurance against
  health shocks may have diminishing returns. This supports the argument
  that assets beyond a reasonable insurance buffer have low marginal utility.

  doi = {10.1017/bca.2023.29},

  CORE ARGUMENT: This meta-analysis estimates the elasticity of marginal
  utility of income (η), a key parameter for distributional weighting in
  cost-benefit analysis and for computing social discount rates. Analyzing
  estimates from the US and UK, the authors recommend using η = 1.6, with
  sensitivity testing at 1.2 and 2.0. This elasticity implies that
  doubling income reduces marginal utility by about 67%.

  RELEVANCE: The elasticity of marginal utility of income is directly
  relevant for calculating how much more high-income individuals should
  give relative to low-income individuals. An elasticity of 1.6 implies
  substantial diminishing returns to income, strengthening the utilitarian
  case for progressive giving norms. However, the paper focuses on income
  rather than wealth, leaving open the question of whether wealth has
  different elasticity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using data from the German Panel on Household Finances,
  this study examines how wealth components (financial assets, real assets,

  that financial assets have stronger positive associations with well-being
  than real assets of equivalent value, and unsecured debt has strong
  negative associations. Relative wealth (comparison to others) also matters
  significantly.

  RELEVANCE: This paper provides crucial empirical evidence on how different
  wealth components affect well-being. The finding that financial assets
  have larger effects than real assets suggests that liquidity and
  optionality contribute to utility beyond the consumption value of assets.
  The strong negative effect of unsecured debt indicates that financial
  vulnerability substantially reduces well-being, supporting the case for
  maintaining a security buffer before giving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper reviews the relationship between income and

  income-happiness gradient is steeper at lower income levels. Poverty has
  large negative effects on happiness that go beyond simple consumption
  effects, including stress, social exclusion, and reduced opportunities.

  RELEVANCE: The steeper gradient at lower income levels provides empirical
  support for diminishing marginal utility of income. This directly
  supports progressive giving norms: transfers from high-income to
  low-income individuals increase total utility. The paper also highlights
  that poverty effects go beyond consumption, suggesting that the marginal
  utility of income for the poor may be even higher than consumption-based
  models would predict.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines how the marginal utility of income
  changes at retirement. Using panel data, the authors find that retirement
  is associated with a fall in the marginal utility of income, suggesting
  that individuals derive less well-being from additional income once they
  are no longer working. This may reflect reduced consumption needs,
  different time use, or changes in aspirations.

  RELEVANCE: The finding that marginal utility of income varies across life
  stages has implications for age-differentiated giving norms. If retirees
  have lower marginal utility of income, this might support higher giving
  rates for retirees (especially those with substantial wealth accumulated
  for retirement). However, retirees also face longevity risk and health
  uncertainties, which may justify retaining assets for precautionary
  reasons.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study distinguishes between positive affect
  (happiness) and negative affect (sadness) in examining the income-emotion
  relationship. Using day reconstruction method data, the authors find that
  higher income is associated with experiencing less sadness but not with
  experiencing more happiness. This asymmetry suggests that income primarily
  buffers against negative emotions rather than generating positive ones.

  RELEVANCE: The asymmetric relationship between income and positive vs.
  negative affect has implications for understanding what income buys. If
  income mainly reduces sadness (through financial security and stress
  reduction) rather than increasing happiness, this supports the insurance/
  security interpretation of wealth's value. It also suggests that the
  marginal utility of income may be higher for those facing financial
  stress (for whom additional income reduces sadness) than for those with
  financial security (for whom additional income doesn't increase happiness).

  doi = {10.1016/j.jebo.2023.01.024},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines the asymmetric response of happiness
  to income gains versus losses. Easterlin finds that happiness decreases
  more when income falls than it increases when income rises by the same

  aspirations: people quickly adapt to income gains (raising their
  aspirations) but adapt slowly to losses (maintaining previous aspirations).

  RELEVANCE: The asymmetric response to income changes has important
  implications for giving norms. If the pain of giving (reducing one's
  income) is greater than the pleasure recipients gain from increased
  income, this could argue against aggressive giving. However, if the
  asymmetry primarily reflects loss aversion rather than true utility, then
  we might discount this consideration. The finding also suggests that
  aspiration management is crucial for happiness in both giving and receiving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review examines the relationship between
  debt and subjective well-being, finding that debt has consistent negative
  associations with well-being even after controlling for income and assets.
  The negative effects are particularly strong for unsecured debt and for
  debt held by low-income individuals. Debt affects well-being through
  financial stress, reduced sense of control, and social stigma.

  RELEVANCE: The strong negative effects of debt on well-being suggest that
  net wealth (assets minus liabilities) is crucial for utility, not just
  gross assets or income. This supports the argument that assets provide
  utility through security and stress reduction, and that a threshold level
  of net wealth is necessary before giving. The asymmetry between debt
  (strongly negative) and assets (weakly positive) suggests that marginal
  utility may be particularly high for moving from negative to positive
  net wealth.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper addresses two puzzles in happiness research.
  First, why does life evaluation rise with income but emotional well-being

  life evaluation reflecting aspirations and comparisons while emotional
  well-being reflects experienced utility.

  RELEVANCE: The distinction between evaluative and experiential measures
  of well-being is crucial for understanding what income and wealth buy.
  If income primarily increases life evaluation (through social comparison
  and aspiration satisfaction) rather than experienced happiness, this
  suggests that the marginal utility of income may be lower than naive
  models assume. For utilitarian giving norms, this raises the question
  of which measure of well-being should be prioritized.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper examines the relationship between adaptation
  and diminishing marginal utility of income. Lee argues that adaptation
  to income gains can explain both the Easterlin paradox and the observed
  diminishing marginal utility of income. As people adapt to higher income,
  their reference point shifts, reducing the utility gain from further
  income increases. However, adaptation is not complete, so some utility
  gain remains.

  RELEVANCE: The adaptation mechanism has important implications for
  understanding both the marginal utility of income and the sustainability
  of giving. If adaptation is strong, then the disutility from giving away
  income may be temporary (as people adapt to their new, lower income level).
  Conversely, recipients may quickly adapt to increased income, reducing
  the long-term utility gain. This suggests that the timing and permanence
  of income changes matter for utilitarian calculations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using three-wave panel data from the US, this study finds
  that hope partially mediates the relationship between income and

  agency component of hope (belief in one's ability to achieve goals) is
  the strongest mediator. This suggests that income affects well-being
  partly by improving people's sense of control over their future.

  RELEVANCE: The mediating role of hope and agency suggests that income
  provides utility not just through consumption but through perceived
  optionality and control. This supports the view that wealth (which
  provides future options) may have different utility characteristics than
  current income (which enables current consumption). The threshold effect
  at $1,800/month also suggests that the income-well-being relationship
  may be highly nonlinear, with different mechanisms operating at different

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques wealth taxation proposals by arguing that capital assets lack determinate values except at realization points (sale, transfer, profit-taking). Mark-to-market taxation would be "arbitrary and unfair" because capital valuation is dynamic and subjective, not static.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to questions about whether giving obligations should target wealth holdings versus income flows. The epistemological argument about asset valuation applies equally to voluntary redistribution—individuals may face severe informational and liquidity problems in assessing their true wealth for giving purposes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Rejects "everyday libertarianism" that treats pre-tax income as morally owned and taxation as confiscation.

Taxes are part of the system that defines what people own, not a taking from what they already own. Evaluates tax systems holistically by their distributive outcomes.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamental challenge to intuitions about "earned" income versus government redistribution. If correct, the income/wealth distinction may be equally conventional—there is no natural baseline from which inherited assets are "more" subject to redistribution than earned income. This view supports treating all resources as equally available for utilitarian redistribution, whether acquired through labor or inheritance.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys four main approaches to inheritance taxation: (1) Mill's scheme limiting receipt rather than bequest, (2) Rawls's acceptance of inheritance with background wealth constraints, (3) Rignano's progressively increasing tax on multigenerational wealth, (4) Haslett's proposal to abolish inheritance entirely. Evaluates each against equality of opportunity, desert-based, and relational egalitarian standards.

  RELEVANCE: Provides systematic overview of normative frameworks for distinguishing inherited from earned resources. The contrast between limiting bequest (donor-side) versus receipt (heir-side) taxation maps onto questions about whether giving obligations fall on asset holders or income earners. Mill's focus on recipient limits rather than donor restrictions has parallels in effective altruism's emphasis on individual donor discretion within certain bounds.

  POSITION: Neutral survey article; presents multiple perspectives on inheritance taxation without strong advocacy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues from within libertarian framework that inheritance taxation to recipients is compatible with—even required by—classical liberal principles. Applies benefit theory of taxation: heirs receive state protection of their inheritance, so should pay for that benefit. Also argues inheritance taxes curb dynastic political power and prevent wealthy families from insulating members from market discipline, both consistent with libertarian values of limited government and free markets.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that even property-rights-focused libertarianism may support differential treatment of inherited versus earned resources. If taxation of inherited wealth can be justified on libertarian grounds, voluntary giving obligations might apply even more strongly to unearned advantages. The market-discipline argument suggests inherited assets represent genuine moral differences from labor income, not merely arbitrary accounting categories.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critical engagement with Halliday's inheritance taxation scheme. Questions whether right to bequeath is as robust as Halliday assumes and whether background institutional arrangements might justify stronger restrictions. Raises concerns about Halliday's egalitarian credentials and interpretation of equality of opportunity, suggesting the Rignano scheme may be too permissive from egalitarian perspective.

  RELEVANCE: Sharpens the debate about how stringently egalitarian principles apply to inherited wealth. If even Halliday's moderate scheme is insufficiently egalitarian, this suggests very strong presumptions against treating inherited assets as legitimately owned for purposes of personal consumption rather than redistribution.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends Mill's proposal to limit how much each person can receive from wealth transfers (via inheritance or gift) while leaving donors free to distribute as they wish. Argues this respects both equality of opportunity (by preventing excessive unearned advantages for recipients) and legitimate parental concern (by not restricting bequest amounts). Superior to estate taxes because it focuses on recipient's cumulative advantage rather than single transfer.

  RELEVANCE: Mill's recipient-focused approach has direct parallels to utilitarian giving frameworks that emphasize individual responsibility for how resources are used rather than collective obligations to avoid certain sources. The cumulative lifetime receipt cap maps onto questions about whether giving obligations should adjust based on total asset holdings regardless of source. Suggests treating all unearned advantages symmetrically rather than distinguishing inheritance from other windfalls.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes relationship between inheritance and equality of opportunity, showing it is "quite complex" depending on how equality of opportunity is interpreted and integrated with other principles. Distinguishes formal, fair, and radical interpretations of equal opportunity, arguing inheritance taxation is only required under fair or radical conceptions but not formal ones. Also considers family-value considerations that might justify some inheritance even under demanding egalitarian standards.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the normative significance of distinguishing earned from inherited resources from equality-of-opportunity perspective. The complexity thesis suggests simple income/wealth distinctions may obscure important normative questions—what matters is how resources relate to individual responsibility and choice, not their formal categorization. Relevant to specifying conditions under which inherited assets trigger stronger utilitarian obligations than labor income.

Defends equality of resources as the appropriate egalitarian metric, later developing this through hypothetical insurance markets and "envy test" thought experiments.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational for resource-egalitarian approaches that distinguish earned from unearned advantages. Dworkin's resource metric focuses on individual endowments (talents, wealth) that are morally arbitrary starting points requiring equalization. This framework suggests inherited wealth and labor-market advantages from natural talents both create unjust inequalities, but through different mechanisms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques "luck egalitarianism" (especially Dworkin, Arneson, Cohen) for misidentifying the point of egalitarian justice. Argues the core concern should be democratic equality—ensuring all can participate as equals in civil society—rather than neutralizing the effects of brute luck on resource holdings. Luck egalitarian policies risk stigmatizing those who make "bad choices" and may leave the imprudent destitute, undermining social equality.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the entire framework of distinguishing earned from unearned advantages that motivates much inheritance taxation debate. If Anderson is correct that relational equality rather than distributive patterns is fundamental, then income/wealth distinctions may matter less than ensuring everyone has sufficient resources for equal standing. However, her focus on democratic participation may support inheritance limits to prevent dynastic political power, even while rejecting luck-egalitarian rationales.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes "equal opportunity for welfare" as the appropriate egalitarian metric, combining welfare-focused outcomes with responsibility-sensitive distribution. Individuals should have equal opportunities to achieve welfare, but resulting inequalities from different choices are acceptable. Brute luck inequalities (from circumstances beyond individual control) should be neutralized, while option luck (voluntary gambles) may justify inequality.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational luck egalitarian position that directly addresses when resource inequalities are just versus unjust. Inherited wealth represents paradigmatic brute luck disadvantage requiring compensation, while income differentials from chosen effort may be justified. However, the article predates inheritance-specific applications and doesn't fully address how natural talent endowments (affecting earning capacity) should be treated—a gap relevant to earned income obligations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques both welfare-focused and resource-focused egalitarianism in favor of "equality of access to advantage." Argues Dworkin's resource equality fails to address disadvantages from low talent/ability (which affect conversion of resources to welfare), while Arneson's welfare equality gives perverse incentives regarding expensive tastes. Proposes broader conception of advantage that includes both resources and welfare-generating capacities.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the "currency question" central to income/wealth debates—what should egalitarian principles equalize? Cohen's broader conception of advantage suggests both inherited wealth and natural earnings capacity create morally arbitrary inequalities requiring compensation. This implies utilitarian obligations may apply to both asset holdings and high earning potential, not just one or the other. The conversion-of-resources issue parallels practical questions about asset liquidity and giving capacity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends libertarian "entitlement theory" of justice in holdings. Just distribution depends entirely on history: How did people acquire holdings (initial acquisition) and how were they transferred (voluntary exchange/gift)? Any "end-state" or "patterned" distributive principles (including income or wealth taxation beyond minimal state funding) violate individual rights by continually interfering with voluntary exchanges to maintain the pattern.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational libertarian objection to redistributive taxation of any kind, whether income or wealth-based. Nozick's focus on historical process rather than distributive outcomes challenges the premise that unearned advantages like inheritance are morally problematic—if acquired through just transfer (bequest), inheritance is as legitimate as earned income. However, even Nozick accepts taxation can be justified if initial acquisition was unjust, opening door to corrective redistribution of dynastic wealth traceable to historical injustice.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "left-libertarian" position combining self-ownership (no forced labor, respect for individual autonomy) with egalitarian distribution of external resources (natural resources, inherited wealth, social product). Proposes universal basic income funded by taxation of resource rents and inherited advantages. Argues this maximizes real freedom—the resources to pursue one's conception of the good—for those with least opportunity.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how to reconcile libertarian commitments to individual autonomy with egalitarian concerns about unearned advantages. Van Parijs's framework suggests earned income from labor should be largely tax-free (respecting self-ownership) while inherited wealth and resource rents face heavy taxation (equalizing external advantages). This maps onto potential distinctions between income-based and asset-based giving obligations, though Van Parijs focuses on state redistribution rather than voluntary charity.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops rigorous left-libertarian theory where all persons have equal rights to natural resources (including land, raw materials, scarce opportunities). Self-ownership is lexically prior, but equal division of natural resource value requires redistributive taxation. Inheritance of legitimately-acquired resources is permissible, but inheritance of unequal shares of natural resources violates equal rights and should be fully taxed.

  RELEVANCE: Provides sharp distinction between two kinds of wealth: (1) product of individual labor (protected by self-ownership), (2) appropriation of natural resources (subject to equality constraint). Inherited wealth typically includes both components, requiring careful decomposition to determine legitimate versus illegitimate portions. This framework could support differential giving obligations based on whether assets derive from labor versus resource appropriation, though implementation faces severe measurement problems.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends libertarian view that redistributive taxation violates property rights, responding to Murphy-Nagel's "conventional ownership" argument. Argues that even if property rights are conventional, individuals still have moral entitlements to their pre-tax income based on contribution and desert. Taxation for redistribution constitutes forced labor because it appropriates time and effort individuals invested in earning income.

  RELEVANCE: Articulates stronger libertarian objection to redistribution than Nozick's purely procedural entitlement theory by invoking desert-based claims. If Huemer is correct that individuals deserve their pre-tax income, this might extend to inheritance (heirs deserve bequests their benefactors chose to give them). However, desert-based arguments are more plausible for earned income than inherited wealth, suggesting possible asymmetry in libertarian defenses of income versus asset holdings.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that egalitarian optimal tax theory (welfarist approach to taxation) addresses major philosophical objections better than resource egalitarianism. Proposes three innovations: (1) welfare-weighted Pigouvian taxes for other-regarding preferences, (2) risk-neutral endowment taxation based partially on ex ante potential income, (3) treating choices as less informative about well-being when distant in past or highly predictable. Claims this narrows gap between welfarism and resource egalitarianism.

  RELEVANCE: Bridges philosophical debates about distributive justice with economic optimal tax literature. The risk-neutral endowment tax proposal directly addresses inherited advantages—taxing potential income capacity rather than realized earnings could capture both natural talent and inherited wealth. The temporal discounting of choice-responsibility challenges strong distinctions between earned and unearned income if earning capacity itself reflects unchosen endowments determined long ago.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops republican theory of economic justice centered on non-domination and democratic sovereignty over the economy. Proposes universal basic income, capital grants, progressive taxation of inheritance and wealth, workplace democracy, and democratic control of investment. Argues these institutions advance republican freedom by reducing economic domination and enabling democratic participation in shaping the economy for the common good.

  RELEVANCE: Recent systematic treatment connecting wealth inequality to republican freedom concerns. The capital grants proposal explicitly targets inherited advantage by redistributing wealth holdings to equalize starting points, going beyond income redistribution. Inheritance taxation justified not by luck egalitarian principles but by preventing domination through concentrated wealth. This provides alternative normative foundation for differential treatment of inherited versus earned resources based on power relations rather than desert or responsibility.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This comprehensive review identifies eight key mechanisms driving charitable giving: awareness of need, solicitation, costs and benefits, altruism, reputation, psychological benefits, values, and efficacy. The authors systematically review empirical evidence for each mechanism across hundreds of studies, finding that most giving is multiply determined by several mechanisms operating simultaneously.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes the empirical landscape of giving predictors. Critical for understanding whether asset-based or income-based norms align with actual giving behavior. The finding that both income and wealth predict giving, but through different mechanisms and at different life stages, directly informs the feasibility of different normative baselines. The psychological benefits mechanism (warm glow) is especially relevant for understanding intrinsic motivation versus utilitarian calculation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Focuses specifically on demographic and economic predictors. Finds that income and wealth have distinct relationships with giving: income predicts giving likelihood across all levels, but wealth becomes a stronger predictor at higher levels. Wealth effects are particularly pronounced for planned giving and bequests. Gender and marital status interact with income/wealth effects.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the income vs. wealth distinction central to the research question. The finding that wealth matters more for certain types of giving (bequests, major gifts) suggests asset-based norms might be more relevant for high-net-worth individuals, while income norms might work better for broad-based giving. The differential effects across demographic groups inform questions about norm universality.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, finds that propensity to donate and amount given increase with household resources. However, the percentage of income given is relatively flat across the income distribution after accounting for outliers—contradicting the common claim that poor give higher percentages. Both income and wealth independently predict giving, with wealth effects being substantial. Extreme outlier households are characterized by specific demographic profiles.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the "U-shaped giving" narrative that poor and rich give more as percentages than middle class. This finding is crucial for evaluating whether percentage-based norms would burden different income groups differently. The independent effects of income and wealth suggest that asset-based norms capture additional capacity to give beyond what income-based norms would capture. Directly relevant to questions about which baseline is more equitable.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Demonstrates that subjective perception of financial resources affects giving independently of actual income and wealth. People who feel financially insecure give less, even controlling for objective financial situation. Subjective financial strain has a stronger negative effect on giving than objective measures like income or debt levels. This suggests psychological factors mediate the resource-giving relationship.

  RELEVANCE: Critical for understanding psychological feasibility of giving norms. If subjective perceptions matter more than objective resources, then asset-based norms might face psychological resistance even when objectively affordable, because wealth feels less liquid and secure than income. Conversely, income-based norms might be more psychologically tractable because regular income feels more available for discretionary use. Highlights the importance of psychological framing in norm implementation.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the paradox that non-binding pledges increase giving even though they are revocable and unenforceable. Develops a theory of time-inconsistent altruism where people are present-biased regarding charitable giving (more altruistic about future giving than present). Pledges serve as commitment devices that allow present selves to constrain future selves. Experimental evidence shows pledges increase giving by 20-30%, with effects concentrated among sophisticated time-inconsistent givers.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to questions about implementing giving norms through pledge mechanisms. If people are time-inconsistent about giving, commitment devices like pledges can help implement either income-based or asset-based norms by allowing people to commit their future selves. However, the effectiveness depends on recognizing one's own time inconsistency. Asset-based pledges might be particularly effective since wealth is more stable and predictable than future income, reducing uncertainty about ability to fulfill the pledge.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence for commitment devices as implementation mechanisms. Shows that psychological sophistication about one's own time inconsistency is crucial. Suggests pledge-based norms could work for either income or assets, but with different psychological requirements.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends the theory of time-inconsistent preferences to charitable giving. Shows that people exhibit present bias in giving decisions—preferring to delay donations and being more generous about future commitments than present ones. This creates a role for commitment devices. Distinguishes between naive and sophisticated time-inconsistent givers, with sophisticated givers being more responsive to commitment opportunities. Experimental evidence confirms these predictions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical foundation for understanding why people fail to give as much as they intend, even when they endorse giving norms. Relevant for both income-based and asset-based norms, but potentially more important for asset-based norms since giving from assets requires active conversion decisions that can be easily postponed. Suggests that effective implementation of either type of norm requires addressing time inconsistency, potentially through automatic mechanisms or commitment devices.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Large-scale field experiment (180,000+ microlending clients in Kyrgyzstan) testing charitable giving by low-income population. Finds that matching incentives crowd in out-of-pocket donations among the poor (opposite of typical finding for wealthy populations). The poor are highly price-sensitive in giving decisions. Proximity to charitable project does not significantly affect giving, contrary to predictions.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that giving behavior differs systematically by income/wealth level, with the poor showing opposite responses to matching incentives compared to the rich. This suggests that optimal implementation of giving norms might differ by economic class. For asset-based norms, the high price sensitivity of low-income givers might be problematic since converting assets to donations has higher transaction costs than giving from income. Income-based norms might be more feasible for broad-based compliance across economic spectrum.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study examining how warm glow varies with source of endowment (earned vs. windfall) and option to take from recipient. Finds that warm-glow giving is stronger when money is earned rather than windfall, and when there is an explicit option to take (making generosity more salient). This suggests giving utility depends on perceived deservingness and moral context, not just amount donated.

  RELEVANCE: Implications for income vs. asset-based norms: earned income might generate stronger warm glow than wealth appreciation (which feels more like windfall). This could make income-based norms psychologically easier to comply with because donors experience more intrinsic satisfaction. However, assets accumulated through saving (earned delayed consumption) might generate warm glow similar to earned income. The framing of giving norms matters for psychological sustainability.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theoretical model incorporating trust in charitable institutions alongside ability-to-pay (income/wealth). Shows that low-income donors may contribute more than high-income donors when trust is high and ability-to-pay differences are explicitly recognized. Model provides foundation for "U-shaped" giving pattern based on social motivation rather than pure income effects. Distinguishes warm-glow, impact, and socially-motivated philanthropy.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights that giving behavior depends not just on resources but on institutional trust and social context. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that building trust in distribution mechanisms is as important as defining the resource baseline. Asset-based norms might face additional trust barriers since verifying wealth is harder than verifying income, creating monitoring challenges. The socially-motivated giving framework suggests norms work best when they are transparent and perceived as fair ability-to-pay standards.

  POSITION: Theoretical integration of trust and resources. Emphasizes institutional context for norm implementation. Suggests transparency and fairness perceptions are crucial for both income-based and asset-based approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Norwegian administrative data and quasi-experimental wealth tax shock to estimate effects on charitable giving. Finds that 1% wealth tax reduces giving by 26%, inconsistent with the hypothesis that wealth taxes incentivize charitable giving to reduce future tax burdens. Also estimates moderate own-price elasticity of giving (-0.44) using income-tax deduction bunching. Religious giving shows larger elasticity.

  RELEVANCE: Provides rare evidence on wealth effects on giving using quasi-experimental design. The large negative effect of wealth taxation on giving suggests that asset-based giving norms might face strong behavioral resistance if implemented through taxation. However, the finding might reflect liquidity constraints rather than unwillingness to give from wealth. For voluntary norms (not tax-enforced), the implications are less clear. The moderate price elasticity suggests tax incentives have limited power to shape giving behavior, whether income-based or wealth-based.

  POSITION: Quasi-experimental evidence for wealth effects. Suggests asset-based approaches face implementation challenges if enforced through taxation, but voluntary asset-based norms might work differently. Highlights importance of distinguishing voluntary from coerced giving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how income inequality at regional level affects individual charitable giving in China. Finds no significant relationship between inequality and giving to high-redistributive causes (poverty alleviation), contrary to predictions. Higher education moderates this relationship slightly positively. Small negative association with giving to low-redistributive causes (arts, culture). Suggests contextual inequality does not automatically increase compensatory charitable behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses whether inequality context affects giving behavior—relevant for understanding whether utilitarian giving norms gain traction in unequal societies. The null finding for redistributive giving suggests that moral arguments about addressing inequality may not automatically translate into behavior. Implications for implementing income vs. asset-based norms: since wealth inequality is higher than income inequality, asset-based norms might face greater psychological resistance in contexts where inequality is salient and wealth concentration is visible.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Survey of Consumer Finances and Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine wealth concentration and prosocial behavior by age. Finds that adults 55+ hold 73% of national wealth (up from 53% in 1989). Older adults donate more and donate larger amounts than younger adults, controlling for wealth, race, and marital status. Also volunteer more hours. Increased prosociality with age persists after controlling for wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that wealth concentration and giving propensity both increase with age, suggesting asset-based giving norms might be particularly relevant for older populations who hold most wealth. However, the age-prosociality relationship independent of wealth suggests intrinsic motivational changes with aging, not just increased capacity. For implementing asset-based norms, targeting older wealth-holders might be most effective, but raises intergenerational equity questions if burden falls disproportionately on elderly.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Uses Philanthropy Panel Study longitudinal data (2005-2017) with fixed effects to examine intrahousehold determinants of giving. Finds women's earned income disproportionately influences household giving decisions when fixed effects control for unobserved heterogeneity. Husband's and wife's unearned income initially predict giving, but only wife's earned income remains significant with fixed effects. Education matters less than income, and only when husband has more education than wife.

  RELEVANCE: Reveals that giving decisions are not unitary within households and earned income has different effects than unearned income (wealth). For implementing giving norms, this suggests household-level norms must account for whose resources are being committed and what type of resources. Asset-based norms might face additional intrahousehold negotiation costs since wealth is typically jointly held. Income-based norms on earned income might be easier to implement since they align with existing behavioral patterns where earners have agency over their earnings.

  POSITION: Panel data evidence for intrahousehold giving dynamics. Challenges unitary household assumption. Suggests norm implementation requires attention to household decision-making structure and resource control.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Experimental study using Comparative Dictator Game with low-income, predominantly African-American participants. Both participants and recipients are from same community. Finds higher giving to more "worthy" recipients (disabled, female heads of household, those with children) when donating to different recipients. When selecting single preferred recipient, participants trade off worthiness against self-interest (selecting those to whom they gave less, particularly those with children).

  RELEVANCE: Shows that perceived deservingness and self-interest both influence giving decisions, even among low-income populations. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that framing matters: norms emphasizing worthiness of recipients might generate more compliance than purely utilitarian arguments. Asset-based norms might be perceived as targeting the "unworthy wealthy" which could increase compliance, but might also trigger self-interest rationalizations. The trade-off between expressed values and actual choices highlights implementation challenges.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how charitable giving responded to the Great Recession (2007-2009) when both income and wealth declined sharply. Finds that giving dropped significantly, with wealth shocks (especially housing wealth) having larger effects than income shocks. Recovery in giving lagged recovery in income and wealth. Different types of charities experienced different impacts, with human services seeing less decline than arts/culture.

  RELEVANCE: Provides natural experiment evidence on relative importance of income vs. wealth for giving. The larger effect of wealth shocks suggests that wealth-based giving might be more volatile and less stable than income-based giving during economic downturns. This volatility could be problematic for charitable organizations relying on donations, but also suggests wealth-holders have greater capacity to give during normal times. For norm implementation, this implies asset-based norms might need stabilizing mechanisms to handle economic shocks.

  POSITION: Natural experiment evidence on income vs. wealth shocks. Shows wealth effects dominate during crisis. Suggests asset-based giving is more pro-cyclical, creating stability concerns for norm implementation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and validates experimentally-tested survey module for measuring economic preferences including altruism, positive reciprocity, negative reciprocity, trust, risk-taking, and time preferences. Shows that survey measures correlate with incentivized experimental measures and predict real-world behaviors. Provides standardized tool for large-scale preference measurement. Applied in Global Preference Survey covering 80,000 individuals in 76 countries.

  RELEVANCE: Provides validated measurement tools for studying prosocial preferences relevant to charitable giving. The altruism and positive reciprocity measures are particularly relevant for predicting compliance with giving norms. The finding that preferences vary systematically across individuals and cultures suggests that universal giving norms (whether income-based or asset-based) may face variable compliance depending on preference distributions. However, preferences are measurable and predictable, enabling targeted norm implementation.

  CORE ARGUMENT: fMRI study examining how stress affects charitable giving. Finds that stress hormone cortisol is associated with reduced donations, but only in individuals with high mentalizing capacity (ability to infer others' mental states). Effect is mediated by reduced value representations in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Low mentalizers show no cortisol effect on giving. Suggests stress affects giving through impact on social cognition and value computation.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that giving behavior is sensitive to physiological stress state and individual cognitive capacities. For implementing giving norms, this suggests that compliance might vary with stress levels and cognitive resources. Asset-based giving might be particularly vulnerable to stress effects since it requires complex financial planning and perspective-taking about long-term consequences. Income-based norms operating through automatic mechanisms (payroll deduction) might be more robust to stress-related compliance failures.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes income-based tithing (10\% of gross income) as a demanding but achievable charitable giving standard for those in the global rich. Argues this norm is not overly demanding because: (1) it leaves donors significantly better off than they would have been under alternative feasible life plans; (2) it allows for agent-relative prerogatives and personal projects; (3) most people adapt quickly to moderate income reductions. Provides empirical evidence on hedonic adaptation and surveys showing 10\% is psychologically achievable.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the appropriate metric (income versus assets) for measuring charitable obligations. The focus on income flows rather than wealth stocks implicitly treats asset accumulation as morally neutral, provided income giving is maintained. This contrasts with asset-based norms that would require giving from principal. The paper's framework for balancing demandingness against impact is essential for evaluating whether asset-based obligations would be excessively demanding. However, it does not address whether holding assets for future giving (patient philanthropy) satisfies the same obligations as income-based giving now.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides comprehensive philosophical survey of arguments for and against temporal discounting in cost-benefit analysis and public policy. Distinguishes pure time preference (discounting merely because of temporal location) from discounting due to opportunity costs of capital, uncertainty, or expected changes in marginal utility. Argues that most standard justifications for positive discount rates conflate these distinct factors. Concludes that pure time preference lacks ethical justification, but practical discounting may be warranted by empirical factors.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding whether temporal considerations justify different moral weight for present versus future obligations. The distinction between pure and empirical discounting clarifies what is at stake in patient philanthropy debates: is the case for deferring giving based on morally neutral opportunity costs, or does it require ethically controversial pure time preference? Greaves' analysis suggests that if patient philanthropy relies on investment returns (opportunity costs) rather than pure preference, it may avoid the strongest philosophical objections. This matters for comparing income-based and asset-based norms, since the latter inherently involves temporal delay.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the consensus that pure time preference is ethically indefensible in climate policy. Argues that positive social time preference can be justified by non-identity considerations and generational sovereignty. When present policies alter the identity of future people (as climate policy does), we cannot harm "them" by discounting, since they would not exist under alternative policies. Additionally, democratic sovereignty of each generation over its own resources may justify discounting future generations' claims. Defends moderate positive discounting as consistent with taking future generations seriously.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the strongest philosophical case against time neutralism, with direct implications for patient philanthropy. If Heath is right that positive time preference is ethically permissible, this weakens the case for investing to give later, since the pure temporal delay itself reduces the moral value of future impact. For the income-versus-assets question, Heath's view suggests that obligations attach more strongly to present income than to hypothetical future wealth from investments. However, his arguments are specifically about intergenerational policy, and may not extend to individual philanthropy where non-identity problems are less acute.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops formal economic models of optimal philanthropic timing when donors have heterogeneous time preferences. Shows that patient philanthropists (those with low discount rates) should typically invest rather than spend, potentially for centuries, before disbursing funds. In equilibrium models with both patient and impatient funders, patient donors optimally save while impatient donors spend, leading to dramatic accumulation of resources by patient funders. Estimates that under plausible parameters, effective altruists should spend nothing for 424 years, accumulating 46\% of societal wealth. Argues this is not a reductio but a genuine implication of optimizing under differential time preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most rigorous theoretical case for patient philanthropy and therefore for asset-based giving norms. If Trammell's models are sound, holding assets for investment rather than giving from income could multiply impact by orders of magnitude. This directly challenges income-based norms like tithing, suggesting that the primary obligation should be to maximize the future philanthropic pot through investment, not to give a fixed percentage of current income. However, the extreme conclusions (centuries of non-spending) may indicate that something is wrong with the model or that practical constraints on fund governance and moral uncertainty limit its applicability.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Edited volume examining temporal dimensions of philanthropic practice from historical, legal, and philosophical perspectives. Essays explore: foundations and perpetuity, "giving while living" movements, legal structures that constrain or enable different temporal approaches, and ethical arguments for giving now versus later. Historical chapters trace how temporal norms in philanthropy have shifted across eras, with recent decades seeing growing skepticism of perpetual foundations and increased emphasis on spending down. Legal chapters examine how tax law and charitable governance structures implicitly embody temporal assumptions.

  RELEVANCE: Provides essential context for understanding how temporal considerations shape philanthropic norms in practice, not just theory. The volume reveals that the give-now versus give-later debate is not purely philosophical but embedded in legal and institutional structures. For the income-versus-assets question, this highlights how tax treatment of different asset types and legal constraints on foundation spending rates affect which norms are feasible. The historical perspective also shows that temporal norms are not fixed: the early 20th century favored perpetual endowments while the early 21st century favors spending down, suggesting these norms are culturally contingent.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends time neutralism (zero pure time preference) against recent challenges from permissivists who argue time discounting is rationally permissible. Responds specifically to Callender's argument that time neutralism relies on the existence of non-existent "pure" time preferences. Greene argues that the time neutralist position does not require positing pure preferences as separate entities; rather, time neutralism is a methodological stance about evaluating preferences. The core time neutralist claim is that it is rationally impermissible to prefer a worse life in expectation merely because of temporal location—this holds regardless of whether pure time preferences exist.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies the philosophical foundations of time neutralism, which underlies much effective altruist thinking about patient philanthropy. Greene's defense is important for asset-based versus income-based norms because it suggests that temporal location per se should not affect the weight of moral obligations. If temporal location is morally arbitrary, then obligations to use assets for future giving are just as strong as obligations to give from current income—the timing does not reduce the obligation. However, this does not yet tell us whether we should give now or later; it only establishes that pure temporal location is not a reason to favor either.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that key determinant of whether an action is right or wrong is often the action's effect on the very long-run future. Strong longtermism combines three claims: (1) those who live at future times matter just as much, morally, as those who live today; (2) there could be vastly many people in the future; (3) we can meaningfully affect what happens in the long-run future. Concludes that influencing the trajectory of civilization (reducing existential risks, improving institutions, promoting beneficial values) is likely the most important thing we can do. This favors working on pivotal issues now rather than investing for later, since we may be at a uniquely influential "hinge of history."

  RELEVANCE: Provides counterpoint to patient philanthropy by arguing that the present may be uniquely important, favoring spending now over investing for later. For income-versus-assets question, longtermism suggests that if we are indeed at a hinge of history, obligations to deploy resources now (from income or assets) are especially strong. However, longtermism does not directly address whether obligations should be measured against income or assets—it concerns what to fund, not what base to measure giving against.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews philosophical and economic arguments for and against intergenerational discounting, separating two distinct ethical issues: (1) impartiality (equal treatment of all generations) and (2) priority to worse-off (aversion to inequality in welfare or resources across generations). Shows these issues have different implications for discount rates. Impartiality alone does not determine a discount rate, since one can treat generations equally while discounting (if inequality aversion is low) or not discounting (if inequality aversion is high). Critiques utilitarian approach for conflating these dimensions and argues that social discounting should be sensitive to both considerations separately.

  RELEVANCE: Clarifies what is morally at stake in debates about time preference, with implications for patient philanthropy and giving norms. The separation of impartiality from priority helps explain why longtermists (high impartiality) and egalitarians (high priority) can disagree about discounting. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests the question is not just about temporal impartiality but about inequality: if future people will be richer, priority-based reasoning might favor giving to present poor over investing for future rich, even if impartiality holds. This complicates Trammell's case for patient philanthropy.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's tithing proposal on four grounds: (1) demandingness—10\% of gross income is more demanding for low-income rich than high-income rich; (2) fairness—it fails to account for varying ability to give; (3) net wealth—focusing on income ignores that wealth inequality is more extreme than income inequality; (4) historical injustice—it does not account for how current wealth arose through exploitation. Proposes instead a principle of progressive giving that scales with both income and wealth, and adjusts for special circumstances. Argues this better fits MacAskill et al.'s own reasons for moderate rather than extreme sacrifice.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges income-based norms and argues for incorporating assets into the base for calculating obligations. This is precisely the income-versus-assets question the research investigates. Aloyo's wealth-based objection suggests that focusing only on income flows allows the very rich to discharge obligations too cheaply, since extreme wealth inequality is primarily in assets not income. However, Aloyo's proposal does not fully address the temporal dimension: if assets are included in the base, should obligations be calculated on current asset value (requiring selling assets to give) or on future returns from assets (allowing investment for later giving)?

  CORE ARGUMENT: Extends patient philanthropy framework to incorporate discounting of future welfare. Even with positive pure time preference, patient philanthropists should still invest for long periods if investment returns exceed the discount rate plus the rate of exogenous improvement in philanthropic opportunities. Provides formal conditions under which patient philanthropy remains optimal. Shows that standard arguments about declining marginal utility of consumption do not undermine patient philanthropy, since philanthropic opportunities may not exhibit declining marginal utility in the same way.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses a key objection to patient philanthropy—that any ethically justified discounting would favor giving now. Trammell shows this is not necessarily true; the case for patience depends on the relationship between three rates: investment returns, discount rate, and rate of improvement in opportunities. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests that even if some discounting is permissible, asset-based approaches (invest and give later) could still dominate income-based approaches if empirical conditions are right. However, this hinges on empirical claims about investment returns that may not hold over long time horizons.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applies real options theory from investment analysis to questions about the value of continuing to live under uncertainty. Argues that staying alive preserves option value—the value of keeping open the possibility of future goods whose realization is uncertain. Even when expected value of future life appears low, option value can make continuing rational. Explores conditions under which option value is positive and draws implications for suicide and euthanasia debates. Shows that irreversibility and uncertainty together create option value in life-or-death decisions.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on life-or-death decisions, the option value framework applies to philanthropic timing. Giving now is irreversible, while holding assets preserves the option to give later when information improves. This provides a distinct argument for patient philanthropy based on uncertainty rather than expected returns: even if giving now has higher expected value, the option value of waiting might dominate. For income-versus-assets norms, this suggests that asset-holding provides flexibility value that income-based giving foregoes. However, this assumes philanthropic opportunities are sufficiently uncertain and that waiting genuinely preserves options rather than just delaying action.

  POSITION: Application of real options theory to philosophical questions under uncertainty.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends use of low (near-zero) pure time discount rates in climate policy cost-benefit analysis. Argues that standard economic approach of discounting future welfare at market interest rates confuses descriptive facts about individual time preference with normative questions about intergenerational ethics. Critiques Nordhaus's high discount rates that justify minimal climate action. Argues that from ethical standpoint of equal treatment of generations, pure time preference rate should be very low (reflecting only catastrophic risk), even if this implies very different policies than would result from market-based discounting.

  RELEVANCE: Influential application of zero pure time preference to major policy question, showing practical implications of time neutralism. For patient philanthropy, Stern's arguments support the view that investment returns (related to market rates) do not ethically justify discounting future welfare. However, Stern focuses on public policy rather than private philanthropy, and his arguments about intergenerational equity may not translate directly to individual donor decisions. The distinction between market rates (opportunity costs) and pure time preference is crucial for evaluating asset-based versus income-based norms.

  POSITION: Economics/policy application of near-zero pure time preference to climate change.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Announces launch of Patient Philanthropy Fund, inspired by Trammell's research, to invest philanthropic capital for future deployment. Fund will invest for minimum 10 years (until 2031) or until reaching \$100 million, then spin out as independent entity. Pre-seed funding from Jaan Tallinn and other major effective altruism donors. Arguments for patient approach: (1) investment returns likely exceed growth in cost-effectiveness of current opportunities; (2) future may offer higher-leverage opportunities we cannot foresee; (3) option value of preserving flexibility. Acknowledges counterarguments including hinge of history hypothesis and moral uncertainty.

  RELEVANCE: Represents practical implementation of patient philanthropy theory, showing that sophisticated donors are willing to commit capital to very long-term investment. For income-versus-assets question, this demonstrates revealed preference: donors who could give from income now choose instead to commit assets for future giving. However, the fund's 10-year minimum (not Trammell's multi-century timeline) suggests practical constraints limit the application of pure theory. The fund structure also sidesteps individual donor questions about whether personal asset accumulation counts as fulfilling obligations, since capital is committed to philanthropic vehicle.

  POSITION: Practical implementation of patient philanthropy; web source documenting real-world application.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Community discussion summarizing arguments for and against giving now versus investing to give later. Key arguments for giving now: (1) hinge of history—present may be uniquely important time; (2) urgent needs exist today that cannot wait; (3) uncertainty about future makes delay risky; (4) psychological benefits of regular giving may increase lifetime total. Key arguments for giving later: (1) investment returns compound, multiplying future impact; (2) future may offer better opportunities as knowledge improves; (3) option value of preserving flexibility; (4) moral uncertainty suggests hedging by doing some of both. Consensus that answer depends heavily on empirical questions about returns and opportunities.

  RELEVANCE: Captures ongoing debate within effective altruism community about philanthropic timing, showing how theoretical arguments cash out in practical donor decisions. For income-versus-assets norms, this reveals that many sophisticated donors are genuinely uncertain about timing, which complicates setting obligations. If even committed consequentialists disagree about optimal timing, it is difficult to say whether asset-based norms (which enable patience) or income-based norms (which enforce current giving) better fulfill obligations. The discussion also highlights moral uncertainty as a consideration favoring diversification across time.

  POSITION: Community synthesis of give-now versus give-later debate; represents current EA thinking.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Podcast interview with Philip Trammell explaining patient philanthropy framework for general audience. Trammell discusses: how compounding investment returns create case for delay; why standard objections about diminishing marginal utility may not apply to philanthropy; practical challenges of multi-generational fund governance; relationship between patient philanthropy and longtermism; and personal question of whether individuals should give now or save. Trammell acknowledges extreme conclusions (centuries of waiting) seem counterintuitive but maintains they follow from the logic of optimization under differential time preferences.

  RELEVANCE: Accessible explanation of patient philanthropy theory with discussion of practical implementation challenges. Interview format allows exploration of objections and edge cases not fully addressed in formal papers. For income-versus-assets question, Trammell's comments on individual giving are particularly relevant: he suggests individuals should consider their personal discount rate and whether they face stronger obligations to give now (e.g., to family, community) that might override pure optimization logic. This suggests even patient philanthropy proponents recognize limits to theory when applied to individual obligations rather than institutional fund management.
