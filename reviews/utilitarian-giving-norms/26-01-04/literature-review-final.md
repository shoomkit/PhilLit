## Introduction

In his foundational paper on global poverty, \citet{singer1972famine} articulates a deceptively simple principle: we ought to prevent bad outcomes when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. This principle has generated decades of philosophical debate about the stringency of our obligations to distant strangers—what \citet{kagan1989limits} defends as unlimited moral demands and what \citet{scheffler1982rejection} seeks to moderate through agent-centered prerogatives. Yet a striking feature of Singer's original formulation has received insufficient attention: the principle specifies no particular resource base. It could apply with equal force to income, accumulated wealth, or total productive capacity.

This theoretical openness stands in tension with how effective altruism has operationalized utilitarian beneficence. The Giving What We Can pledge—committing donors to contribute at least 10% of lifetime income to effective charities—has become the paradigmatic expression of utilitarian giving norms \citep{macaskill2015doing}. As \citet{macaskill2019definition} emphasizes, effective altruism aims to use evidence and reason to benefit others as much as possible with "the resources in our possession." Yet the movement's practical conventions have converged on income-based metrics without systematic justification for this choice over asset-based alternatives. The 10% pledge echoes religious tithing traditions but adapts them to secular utilitarian ends, focusing on income flows while largely ignoring the stock of accumulated wealth.

This convergence on income-based norms may represent a significant theoretical gap. \citet{aloyo2023effective} challenges the 10% standard on multiple grounds, arguing that fixed-percentage income pledges are simultaneously too demanding for low earners and insufficiently demanding for the wealthy. His "net wealth" objection is particularly salient: giving norms should consider total resources, not just income flows. The marginal utility considerations that ground utilitarian beneficence may actually favor asset-sensitive giving strategies. Assets beyond a reasonable security threshold serve primarily insurance, optionality, and positional functions—purposes whose marginal utility arguably diminishes more rapidly than income directed toward ongoing consumption needs. If accumulated wealth above a certain threshold contributes less to donor welfare than equivalent income, utilitarian principles may demand more aggressive asset-based giving than current norms recognize.

This review examines whether marginal utility considerations support a shift from income-based to asset-sensitive giving norms within utilitarian frameworks. The analysis proceeds through seven domains: theoretical foundations of utilitarian beneficence, the marginal utility asymmetry between income and assets, existing philanthropic norms and their justifications, property rights and wealth taxation considerations, temporal dimensions of giving obligations, empirical feasibility constraints, and research gaps requiring further investigation. Throughout, the review maintains focus on a specific practical question: what resource base should utilitarian giving norms track, and what thresholds or progressive structures might better capture our obligations than fixed income percentages?


## Section 1: Utilitarian Foundations and the Demandingness Challenge

Utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to aid those in need, yet the extensive literature on demandingness has focused almost exclusively on *whether* and *how much* to give rather than *from what resource base*. This omission is significant: if the abstract pool of "resources" admits of meaningful distinctions—particularly between income flows and accumulated assets—then the practical operationalization of utilitarian obligations may look quite different depending on which base we choose. This section establishes the theoretical landscape by examining both the case for strong obligations and the major strategies for moderating demand, attending throughout to how each position might apply differently to income versus assets.

### 1.1 The Case for Strong Obligations

The foundational argument for demanding beneficence appears in \citet{singer1972famine}, whose principle that we ought to prevent bad outcomes whenever we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance has structured subsequent debate. Singer's marginal utility framework—give until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to recipients—applies with equal formal validity to income and assets, yet its practical applications have overwhelmingly focused on income-based giving. This asymmetry lacks explicit justification in Singer's framework.

\citet{kagan1989limits} provides the most systematic defense of unlimited utilitarian demands, arguing that commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest on indefensible agent-centered prerogatives and constraints. On Kagan's view, consequentialism's demanding character is a feature rather than a bug, reflecting morality's genuine requirements. His rejection of principled limits on moral demands bears directly on whether utilitarian giving norms can accommodate personal wealth retention beyond bare necessities—a question that becomes increasingly pressing as one moves from income to accumulated assets.

\citet{unger1996living} complements these theoretical arguments with psychological evidence. Through a series of carefully constructed puzzles, Unger demonstrates that morally irrelevant factors—physical proximity, directness of causal connection, salience—systematically distort our judgments about obligations to aid distant strangers. When these distorting factors are removed, we recognize far more stringent obligations than conventional giving levels suggest. Notably, Unger's focus on psychological distortions may apply asymmetrically to income and assets: evolved hoarding instincts may distort intuitions about accumulated wealth more severely than about income flows.

This asymmetric application of debunking arguments receives indirect support from \citet{delazariradek2013demanding}, who argue that evolutionary explanations of self-interested bias undermine the rational foundation of objections to demanding requirements. If self-interested bias evolved to protect stored resources against competitors, we might expect intuitions about asset retention to be more evolutionarily distorted than intuitions about income disposition. The demandingness literature, however, has not systematically pursued this asymmetry, instead treating "resources" as an undifferentiated category.

### 1.2 Moderating Strategies and Their Limits

The major strategies for limiting utilitarian demands—agent-centered prerogatives, cooperative principles, and life-altering demands frameworks—each provide conceptual resources for moderating obligations, yet none has been systematically applied to distinguish income from asset obligations. This represents a significant gap, since each framework plausibly generates different conclusions when applied to these different resource bases.

\citet{scheffler1982rejection} proposes a hybrid theory incorporating an agent-centered prerogative allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own interests and projects. The prerogative is grounded in the independence and integrity of persons as distinct agents with their own perspectives. Crucially, if assets are more closely tied to long-term life plans and security than income flows, Scheffler's framework might permit greater retention of assets while requiring more stringent giving from income. Alternatively, if security beyond a threshold contributes little to personal projects, the framework might support stronger asset-based obligations.

\citet{murphy1993demands} and \citet{murphy2000moral} develop the cooperative principle, limiting individual obligations to a "fair share" of the collective good that would result if all agents complied. This directly addresses questions of percentage and amount, yet the framework's application remains ambiguous between income and assets. If fair share should track total capacity rather than annual flow, Murphy's framework would support asset-sensitive norms. The cooperative principle specifies what agents ought to do assuming full compliance, but leaves open whether compliance should be measured against income, wealth, or some combination.

\citet{cullity2004moral} seeks middle ground through the concept of "life-altering demands"—requirements that would fundamentally change one's life plan mark the boundary between obligation and supererogation. This framework directly engages with how giving affects agents' lives, yet generates potentially divergent conclusions for income and assets. For affluent individuals, asset depletion beyond a security threshold may be less life-altering than equivalent income reduction, since ongoing consumption depends primarily on income flows while assets serve insurance and positional functions. If so, Cullity's framework would support stronger obligations on assets than income.

\citet{portmore2011commonsense} develops commonsense consequentialism with a dual-ranking structure that preserves consequentialist concern for overall good while incorporating agent-relative value. This sophisticated framework could support differential treatment of income and assets if they enter differently into agent-relative versus impersonal value rankings—assets tied to security and long-term planning might carry more agent-relative value than current income, or might carry less if marginal security is low. The framework provides structure for the analysis but does not itself resolve the income-versus-assets question.

The literature on demandingness thus provides rich conceptual resources for specifying utilitarian obligations, yet has not applied these resources to the fundamental question of which resource base—income, assets, or some function of both—should ground practical giving norms. This gap is particularly striking given that the marginal utility considerations central to utilitarian theory plausibly apply differently to income and accumulated wealth. The following sections take up this gap directly.


## Section 2: The Marginal Utility Asymmetry Between Income and Wealth

A central premise of utilitarian giving norms is that resources transferred from donors to recipients generate greater welfare gains at the margin. Yet existing frameworks typically operationalize this through income percentages without interrogating whether accumulated wealth exhibits the same marginal utility profile as ongoing income. This section marshals converging evidence from behavioral economics, positional goods theory, and sufficientarian philosophy to argue that assets beyond a security threshold have systematically lower marginal utility than income, justifying differential treatment in philanthropic frameworks.

### 2.1 Precautionary Savings and the Insurance Function of Wealth

Empirical research on household wealth behavior reveals a striking puzzle: retirees systematically fail to decumulate assets at rates standard consumption theory predicts. \citet{horioka2020wealth}, analyzing Italian household panel data, find that over 40% of retired elderly continue accumulating wealth, with more than 80% maintaining positive savings despite declining income. Their pan-European extension using SHARE data confirms this pattern broadly: average wealth accumulation among retirees runs positive at 6.6% over three years, with less than half decumulating at all \citep{horioka2022retired}. This "wealth decumulation puzzle" demonstrates that assets serve fundamentally different purposes than income—primarily insurance against uncertainty and bequest vehicles rather than consumption funds.

The precautionary motive emerges most clearly when examining housing wealth. \citet{painter2021housing} exploit a natural experiment in urban China where housing equity cannot be withdrawn, isolating the pure wealth effect from credit channels. Their findings are remarkable: a 1% increase in housing wealth raises consumption by only 0.14%, yielding a marginal propensity to consume of merely 2.3%. Crucially, this already-small effect concentrates among employees facing greater income uncertainty, confirming that housing wealth operates through precautionary motives rather than direct consumption. When households perceive their income as secure, housing wealth has virtually no consumption effect—it functions purely as insurance.

These findings challenge the standard expected utility framework that undergirds much utilitarian reasoning about resource allocation. As \citet{odono2018modeling} demonstrate, the traditional model deriving risk aversion from diminishing marginal utility of wealth faces serious empirical difficulties. Their analysis shows that risk preferences and wealth effects are conceptually separable: wealth may provide security and option value without necessarily translating into proportional consumption utility. This theoretical refinement supports treating wealth's marginal utility as distinct from income's—assets provide insurance, flexibility, and security, but these functions saturate at levels far below where consumption utility from income plateaus.

### 2.2 Positional Goods and the Status Function of Wealth

Beyond insurance, wealth increasingly serves positional rather than absolute welfare functions as it accumulates beyond security thresholds. \citet{walasek2017positional} provide striking empirical evidence using millions of Twitter posts across U.S. regions: mentions of luxury brands (Rolex, Louis Vuitton) correlate positively with regional income inequality, while everyday brands show the opposite pattern. This large-scale behavioral data confirms that consumption of positional goods intensifies precisely where relative standing is more salient. Wealth accumulated beyond basic needs increasingly purchases relative position rather than absolute welfare.

The philosophical implications are developed by \citet{shahar2017positional}, who argues that positional goods generate egalitarian concerns independent of prioritarian or standard welfare considerations. When goods are positional, marginal utility decreases not merely through diminishing returns but because one person's gain constitutes another's relative loss. This zero-sum dimension dramatically reduces the absolute marginal utility of excess wealth: positional competition produces no net welfare gain while consuming resources. Shahar's analysis suggests accumulated assets—luxury housing, exclusive education, investment portfolios signaling status—have even lower utilitarian value than standard diminishing marginal utility would predict.

\citet{halliday2020positional} extend this analysis to "upstream agency," examining how access to positional goods is created and allocated. Their taxonomy reveals that much wealth accumulation involves competition for goods whose value is inherently relative: elite university admissions, exclusive neighborhoods, scarce luxury items. This structural analysis reinforces the distinction between income (addressing ongoing consumption needs with relatively stable marginal utility) and wealth (increasingly channeled toward positional competition where marginal social utility approaches zero). The positional dimension constitutes a distinct reason—beyond standard diminishing returns—for treating accumulated assets differently from income flows in utilitarian frameworks.

### 2.3 Sufficientarian Thresholds and Asset Treatment

Sufficientarian philosophy provides principled foundations for threshold-based treatment that maps naturally onto the income/wealth distinction. \citet{hassoun2021sufficiency} develops a rigorous account of the sufficiency threshold based on what people need for autonomous functioning and minimally good lives. This threshold, while going beyond bare survival, falls short of full flourishing and is independently specifiable for policy guidance. Above this threshold, additional resources matter less morally—precisely the pattern observed empirically for wealth beyond security levels.

\citet{huseby2020sufficiency} refines this framework by proposing two separate thresholds: one marking where urgent needs are met, another where additional benefits become less morally important. This dual-threshold structure maps productively onto the income/wealth distinction. Income addresses ongoing consumption needs at and around the lower threshold, maintaining relatively high marginal utility for meeting basic requirements. Adequate assets address security at the upper threshold, but once this security function is satisfied, additional wealth serves primarily positional or bequest purposes with sharply diminished marginal utility.

The formal integration of sufficientarian and utilitarian axioms by \citet{bossert2021criticallevel} provides rigorous grounding for this differential treatment. Their "critical-level sufficientarianism" applies absolute priority below the threshold while using utilitarian principles as tie-breakers above it. This framework accommodates the empirical reality that both income and wealth matter urgently below sufficiency, but diverge above it: income continues addressing consumption with measurable marginal utility, while wealth increasingly serves functions with near-zero marginal welfare benefit.

\citet{kanschik2015sufficientarianism} adds a risk-based dimension particularly relevant to asset holdings. He argues that even above sufficiency, progressive obligations are justified because those closer to the threshold face greater risk of falling below it. This risk decreases with distance from threshold, justifying stronger obligations for those with greater security buffers. Applied to wealth, those with substantial assets face minimal risk of insufficiency—their marginal utility from additional assets approaches zero not only in consumption terms but in security terms as well. This risk-based reasoning directly supports progressive asset-based giving norms that increase with distance from security thresholds.

### Section Summary

Converging evidence establishes that assets beyond security thresholds exhibit systematically different marginal utility than income. Empirically, households accumulate wealth primarily for precautionary and bequest motives rather than consumption, with marginal propensities to consume as low as 2.3% for housing wealth. Theoretically, wealth increasingly serves positional functions where one person's gain implies another's relative loss, reducing marginal social utility below what standard diminishing returns predict. Philosophically, sufficientarian frameworks identify thresholds above which additional resources matter less morally, with risk-based arguments specifically supporting progressive obligations tied to asset levels. This asymmetry provides theoretical foundation for giving norms that treat accumulated wealth differently from ongoing income—a distinction absent from current frameworks like the 10% income pledge.


## Section 3: Existing Philanthropic Norms and the EA Framework

Effective altruism represents the most sophisticated contemporary attempt to operationalize utilitarian giving obligations. Yet despite its theoretical flexibility, the movement has converged on income-based norms without systematic justification for this choice over asset-based alternatives. This section critically examines that convergence.

### 3.1 The 10% Pledge and Its Justification

The path from \citet{singer1972famine}'s abstract principle—give until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to recipients—to the Giving What We Can pledge's concrete 10% income target represents a remarkable philosophical journey. Singer's foundational argument specifies no particular resource base; it could apply equally to income flows or accumulated wealth. The principle concerns preventing bad outcomes without sacrificing anything of "comparable moral importance," a formulation that is theoretically neutral between income and assets.

\citet{macaskill2019definition} defines effective altruism as using "evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible" with "the resources in our possession." This definition is notably ecumenical—it neither mandates utilitarianism nor specifies which resources count. Assets are no less "in our possession" than income, yet EA's practical focus has centered almost exclusively on the latter. \citet{macaskill2015doing} popularized the 10% income pledge as an accessible commitment mechanism, establishing it as EA's primary gateway practice.

Empirical research has tracked who makes these commitments. \citet{wilks2023who} found that Giving What We Can pledgers display distinctive psychological profiles: expanded moral circles, higher need for cognition, and actively open-minded thinking. Yet this study necessarily tracks income pledgers specifically—we lack comparable data on those who might prefer asset-based commitment structures. The question of whether EA's income focus reflects principled choice or merely the availability of measurable metrics remains open.

### 3.2 The Progressive Giving Challenge

\citet{aloyo2023effective} offers the most direct challenge to income-based norms in EA literature. His critique of the 10% threshold rests on four objections: demandingness (10% is too burdensome for low earners), fairness (flat percentages ignore differential capacity), historical injustices (some wealth derives from colonial extraction), and crucially, net wealth. This final objection argues that giving norms should track total resources, not just income flows.

Aloyo's net wealth objection strikes at the heart of income-based conventions. A retiree with substantial assets but minimal income faces negligible obligations under income-based norms despite having considerable capacity to give. Conversely, a high earner with negative net worth (student loans, mortgage debt) faces demanding obligations despite precarious financial position. Aloyo proposes progressive giving scaled to genuine capacity, though he does not fully develop the theoretical case for asset-based calculations.

The psychological literature illuminates why EA converged on income despite theoretical neutrality. \citet{schubert2024mind} argue that effective altruism must work with human cognitive architecture rather than against it. Income is psychologically salient—it arrives regularly, is precisely measured, and is explicitly tracked for tax purposes. Wealth, by contrast, is harder to calculate, more emotionally fraught, and often tied to assets people perceive differently from income flows. \citet{caviola2021psychology} identify cognitive biases that impede effective giving; these barriers may be even more pronounced for wealth-based commitments, where illiquidity, valuation uncertainty, and stronger ownership intuitions complicate the picture.

This psychological analysis explains EA's practical convergence on income norms but does not establish that this convergence is justified. The fact that income-based pledges are psychologically easier does not make them philosophically correct if marginal utility considerations favor asset-based alternatives.

### 3.3 Institutional and Political Critiques

Major critiques of effective altruism bear indirectly on the income-assets question. \citet{gabriel2017critics} systematically evaluates three objections: the justice critique (EA neglects equality and rights), the methodological critique (quantification bias), and the systemic change critique (focus on symptoms over causes). The justice critique is particularly salient: if EA's utilitarian framework inadequately addresses distributive concerns, this limitation may extend to its treatment of income versus wealth. Income-based voluntary pledges leave existing wealth distributions untouched in ways that wealth-based obligations would not.

\citet{lechterman2020effective} argues that EA faces an unresolved tension between its depoliticized charitable approach and the inherently political nature of global poverty. Income-based voluntary pledges represent an individualist, market-friendly framework that sidesteps questions about collective obligations and structural reform. Asset-based obligations, by contrast, might require coordinated political action—wealth taxes, inheritance reform, or collective redistribution schemes that cannot be achieved through individual pledges alone.

\citet{dietz2019effective} presses this point through collective action analysis. Individual-level optimization may be self-defeating when coordinated group action would produce superior outcomes. Applied to giving norms, this suggests that voluntary income-based pledges—however well-intentioned—may be less effective than politically-mediated wealth redistribution. If EA's core commitment is to doing the most good, and if structural approaches outperform individual giving, EA's own principles would recommend systemic alternatives.

\citet{berkey2018institutional} defends EA against such critiques, arguing that the movement is theoretically compatible with institutional reform and would pursue systemic change if evidence supported its superiority. This defense implies that EA could accommodate asset-based approaches if they proved more effective. The question is not whether EA's principles permit wealth-based obligations—they clearly do—but whether its practical conventions have adequately considered this possibility.

**Section Summary**: EA's theoretical framework is genuinely ecumenical between income and asset bases for giving obligations. Yet the movement's practical convergence on income-based pledges reflects a combination of psychological convenience, measurability, and path dependence rather than principled argument. Neither EA's defenders nor its critics have systematically addressed whether assets warrant different treatment from income in determining philanthropic obligations.


## Section 4: Asset Ethics, Property Rights, and Wealth Limits

The question of whether utilitarian giving obligations should track income or assets cannot be resolved without examining how different philosophical traditions treat accumulated wealth. Property rights theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism each provide distinctive resources for thinking about asset-based obligations, and their convergence on treating wealth differently from earned income provides substantial philosophical support for asset-sensitive giving norms.

### 4.1 Property Rights and Beneficence

A persistent objection to asset-based giving obligations holds that accumulated wealth represents legitimately acquired property over which owners have exclusive rights. This libertarian challenge dissolves, however, once we examine the conceptual foundations of property itself.

\citet{murphy2002myth} mount a fundamental challenge to pre-tax property rights, arguing that property entitlements can only be determined *after* specifying a legitimate system of distribution, including taxation. On their view, there is no fact about what one "deserves" prior to institutional specification—the very concept of pre-institutional property is mythical. This reframing removes libertarian barriers to asset-based obligations: if property rights are constituted by the legal and moral system rather than existing prior to it, then obligations on assets cannot violate natural rights that do not exist. The question becomes which obligation structure—income-based or asset-based—better achieves distributive justice goals, precisely the question the present research addresses.

Even within frameworks that grant robust pre-institutional property rights, asset-based obligations find support. \citet{udi2015locke} demonstrates that Lockean property theory, often invoked to resist redistribution, actually accommodates strong charitable obligations. Udi argues that for Locke, property rights and duties of charity both derive from a common source: the fundamental right to preservation. God's grant that each person has a right to the means of preservation simultaneously grounds property acquisition (individuals may appropriate what they need) and charitable obligations (others retain claims when their preservation is threatened). Property rights are thus not absolute but constrained by others' preservation needs from the outset. This convergence—a liberal egalitarian rejection of pre-institutional property and a Lockean reconciliation of property with charity—suggests that asset-based giving obligations are compatible with, rather than violations of, property rights theory across diverse frameworks.

### 4.2 Inheritance and Intergenerational Wealth

Assets function distinctively in perpetuating inequality across generations, providing additional grounds for treating them differently from income. \citet{halliday2018inheritance} argues that unrestricted inheritance is unjust because it perpetuates intergenerational inequality, creating what he terms "economic segregation" by concentrating opportunities within specific family lineages. Crucially, this concentration operates through assets rather than income: wealth compounds across generations through inheritance and investment, while income typically does not transfer intergenerationally. This asymmetry suggests that asset holdings create justice concerns distinct from those arising from income flows.

\citet{white2018moral} addresses the common objection that assets represent "double taxation"—that they are already after-tax income and should not face additional obligations. White systematically refutes this concern, arguing that what matters for justice is not the history of a resource's taxation but its current contribution to inequality and the opportunities it affords. The differential treatment of assets is justified by their effects on distribution, not by their tax history. \citet{pedersen2020distributive} extends this analysis by comparing income and wealth taxation on ability-to-pay grounds, arguing that wealth taxes better track true capacity to contribute than income taxes alone, while avoiding disincentive effects on labor. This framework applies directly to voluntary giving norms: if ability-to-pay considerations justify treating assets distinctively for taxation, parallel reasoning supports asset-sensitive philanthropic obligations.

The breadth of philosophical consensus here is striking. \citet{bird-pollan2017philosophical} examines wealth transfer taxation from utilitarian, Rawlsian, libertarian, and capabilities perspectives, finding that most major political philosophies support some form of distinctive treatment for wealth transfers. This convergence across frameworks that disagree about income taxation suggests something normatively distinctive about the status of accumulated assets.

### 4.3 Limitarianism and Upper Wealth Bounds

Limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings—provides philosophical grounding for asset-specific obligations that complements marginal utility arguments. \citet{robeyns2019extreme} introduces the framework, arguing that wealth beyond the threshold needed for flourishing should be redirected to address urgent unmet needs. This threshold corresponds closely to the "security threshold" central to the present research: the point beyond which additional assets serve primarily insurance and positional functions with diminishing marginal utility.

\citet{timmer2024limitarianism} refines the conceptual structure by distinguishing two interpretations of "excess" wealth. On the zero-value interpretation, resources above the threshold have no moral value for the holder; on the outweighed-value interpretation, they retain some value but are outweighed by others' claims. This distinction maps onto the marginal utility question: assets beyond security thresholds may have *low* rather than *zero* marginal utility, but this value is outweighed by the higher marginal utility others would derive from the same resources. \citet{timmer2018defending} addresses practical objections, arguing that targeting wealth above flourishing thresholds minimizes productivity costs while capturing resources with low utility to holders.

The limitarian position gains additional support from \citet{axelsen2020expressive}, who argue that extreme wealth is *expressively* unjust—it conveys the morally objectionable message that one's interests matter vastly more than others'. This adds a non-consequentialist dimension to asset-based obligations: beyond a certain threshold, asset retention is not merely inefficient but expresses a problematic stance toward others. \citet{kramm2020limits} demonstrate that these intuitions have deep historical roots, surveying proto-limitarian arguments from Plato through Mill and finding persistent philosophical concern with wealth limits across diverse traditions.

**Section Summary**: Property theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism converge on treating assets distinctively from income. Murphy and Nagel remove libertarian barriers by denying pre-institutional property rights; Udi shows that even robust property frameworks accommodate charitable obligations. The inheritance literature demonstrates that assets create distinctive intergenerational justice concerns. Limitarianism provides threshold-based frameworks that align with marginal utility analysis. This convergence provides philosophical support for asset-specific giving obligations, though these frameworks have focused on taxation and redistribution rather than voluntary giving norms—a gap the present research addresses.


## Section 5: Temporal Considerations and Patient Philanthropy

The preceding analysis of income versus asset-based giving norms has implicitly assumed that philanthropic resources should be deployed relatively promptly. Yet a growing literature on patient philanthropy challenges this assumption, arguing that optimal timing may involve substantial delay between resource accumulation and disbursement. This section examines how decision-theoretic considerations about giving timing interact with the income/assets question.

### 5.1 The Case for Patient Philanthropy

\citet{trammell2020discounting} demonstrates that philanthropists who weight future welfare equally with present welfare should remove pure time preference from their discount rate calculations. Under historical investment return assumptions of 4-7% and philanthropic discount rates of only 0.5-2%, this framework implies that patient philanthropists could justify saving resources for decades or even centuries before deployment. This finding directly challenges the implicit assumption underlying income-based giving norms—that resources should be disbursed contemporaneously with earning.

The implications deepen when we consider heterogeneous donor populations. \citet{trammell2021dynamic} models optimal philanthropic timing when funders have different discount rates, proving that more patient funders should invest entirely while impatient funders spend. This coordination dynamic suggests that optimal giving norms may differ across individuals based on time preferences, complicating universal prescriptions like the 10% income pledge. \citet{greaves2021longtermism} extend this framework further, arguing that if influencing the far future through existential risk reduction dominates near-term charitable opportunities, resources might optimally be accumulated for civilizational trajectory changes rather than immediate poverty alleviation.

These arguments might seem to favor asset-based norms, since patient philanthropy involves accumulating resources through investment. However, the relationship is not straightforward. As \citet{madoff2023giving} observe in their comprehensive treatment of temporal dimensions in philanthropy, patient philanthropy addresses *when* to give but leaves open the question of *from what base* to calculate obligations when giving does occur. A philanthropist practicing patient accumulation must still determine whether eventual disbursements should track historical income, current assets, or some other measure.

### 5.2 Uncertainty and Decision-Theoretic Limits

The sophisticated expected-value reasoning underlying patient philanthropy faces significant challenges. \citet{mogensen2020maximal} argues that "cluelessness"—our inability to predict the long-run consequences of our actions—combined with permissive decision rules for deep uncertainty undermines confident cause prioritization. If we cannot reliably assess whether patient investment or immediate disbursement produces better long-term outcomes, the case for complex timing optimization weakens. This might favor simpler heuristics, but crucially, the uncertainty cuts both ways: cluelessness does not obviously favor income-based over asset-based norms or vice versa.

\citet{lim2019effectiveness} presses a related ecumenicity critique, arguing that different moral frameworks and risk attitudes may justify diverse giving patterns. If individuals may reasonably support various philanthropic approaches based on different values and evidential standards, this supports pluralism about giving norms rather than any single optimal formula—whether income-based, asset-based, or temporally sophisticated. \citet{lucas2023reflections} reinforces these concerns from financial economics, demonstrating that standard discounting methods become unreliable for very long time horizons due to deep uncertainty about projections and the inadequacy of present value as a measure of value. This suggests that both patient philanthropy's case for delay and immediate giving's case for urgency face decision-theoretic challenges that resist confident resolution.

In sum, temporal considerations complicate but do not resolve the income/assets question. Patient philanthropy might justify asset accumulation, while uncertainty might favor simpler norms, but neither line of argument clearly privileges income-based over asset-based approaches to calculating philanthropic obligations.


## Section 6: Empirical Giving Behavior and Norm Feasibility

The theoretical case for asset-based giving norms must confront behavioral reality: how do donors actually respond to different income sources, and what psychological factors determine whether giving commitments translate into action? Empirical research reveals both support for the marginal utility asymmetry thesis and important implementation considerations that any viable giving norm must address.

### 6.1 Differential Treatment of Income Sources

A striking finding from behavioral economics directly supports the thesis that different income sources have different marginal utility profiles. \citet{drouvelis2019bonus} demonstrate through two experiments that bonus and windfall income generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income of equivalent amount. Crucially, this pattern is explained by social norms rather than individual preferences: a coordination game reveals that people believe morally appropriate donation levels depend on both the amount received and *whether it was earned or windfall*. This provides behavioral evidence that donors implicitly recognize the marginal utility asymmetry—regular income serving ongoing needs carries higher personal value than unexpected gains resembling asset accumulation.

This differential treatment connects to \citet{andreoni1990impure}'s foundational analysis of "warm-glow" giving. Andreoni's framework distinguishes pure altruism (caring about recipient welfare) from impure altruism (deriving personal satisfaction from the act of giving itself). The warm-glow component helps explain why regular income-based giving may generate more psychological satisfaction than less frequent asset-based contributions: habitual giving creates repeated opportunities for warm glow, while occasional large gifts from assets provide fewer such moments despite potentially greater impact.

Whether social norms can shift giving behavior is addressed by \citet{chapman2025social}'s meta-analysis of 113 samples (N=100,469 across 22 countries). The analysis finds a moderate positive relationship between social norms and charitable giving (r=.18), with injunctive norms (what one *ought* to do) outperforming descriptive norms (what most people *actually* do). This suggests that moral arguments about appropriate giving—whether from income or assets—matter more than information about what others give. The finding that effects are stronger for internalized norms and close social referents implies that norm change may require grassroots movement building rather than top-down pronouncements. However, the detection of publication bias counsels caution about overstating these effects.

### 6.2 Pledge Effectiveness and Implementation

The contrast between income-based and asset-based commitment mechanisms is illuminated by \citet{schmitz2021billionaires}'s analysis of the Giving Pledge's first decade. While the pledge attracted 211 billionaire signatories committing to give away at least half their wealth during lifetime or at death, its impact remains difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and vague timeline. The pledge letters reveal giving motivated by desires to "make a difference" and personal fulfillment, yet the absence of binding enforcement and measurable milestones contrasts sharply with the regular, accountable structure of income-based pledges like Giving What We Can's 10% commitment.

This implementation difference connects to a fundamental methodological concern raised by \citet{shang2019giving}. Using data from over 17,000 donors, they demonstrate that relationships between psychological factors and charitable giving are 3-8 times larger when modeling stated intentions than actual behavior. Strikingly, 27% of donors who expressed no intention to give nevertheless donated, revealing a substantial gap between expressed attitudes and action. For evaluating giving norms, this finding cautions against relying on survey evidence about willingness to adopt new commitments. The large intention-behavior gap suggests that binding, regular commitments with measurable compliance—features more readily achieved by income-based pledges—may prove more effective than aspirational wealth-based commitments with distant and flexible fulfillment horizons.

### 6.3 Psychological Barriers and Design Considerations

Designing effective giving norms requires understanding psychological heterogeneity among potential donors. \citet{yoon2024interactive} find through experiments (N=2,203) and a field study with alumni donations (N=22,468) that making incentives more salient increases prosocial behavior when prosocial motivation is low, but has no effect—or even negative effect—when motivation is already high. This interaction suggests that one-size-fits-all approaches may be suboptimal. Income-based norms emphasizing habit formation might work well for already-motivated donors, while asset-based norms requiring explicit incentive framing might better activate the less-motivated, though risking crowding out among committed givers.

Framing effects further complicate norm design. \citet{howe2021normative} demonstrate across six experiments that "working-together" appeals inviting people to "join in" and "do it together" significantly increased actual charitable donations, while equivalent normative-information appeals (same information, no collaboration framing) had no effect. The mechanism operates through fostering feelings of collective action that increase motivation while reducing perceived social pressure. This finding suggests asset-based norms may succeed better when framed as joining a collective movement ("Join the effective giving community in dedicating a portion of assets annually") rather than individual compliance with external expectations.

Finally, \citet{grossman2024self} decompose warm glow into self-image and social-image components, finding that social-image concerns increase donation amounts among those who choose to give but do not expand the donor pool, while self-image concerns affect both decisions. This distinction has direct implications for norm design: income-based norms with regular, visible giving create more opportunities for social recognition, potentially leveraging social-image concerns effectively. Asset-based norms, being less frequent and often private, may need to rely more heavily on self-image appeals—emphasizing moral identity and personal satisfaction from substantial impact.

### Section Summary

Behavioral evidence provides convergent support for the marginal utility asymmetry: donors treat windfall income as more available for giving, consistent with the thesis that accumulated resources beyond ongoing needs have lower personal marginal utility. However, the evidence also reveals significant implementation asymmetries. Income-based norms offer advantages in regularity, measurability, and social visibility that leverage warm glow and social-image concerns through repeated giving opportunities. Asset-based norms face challenges from the intention-behavior gap, measurement difficulties, and lower social salience. Addressing these challenges would require careful attention to framing (collective movement rather than individual compliance), commitment mechanisms (binding rather than aspirational), and psychological targeting (self-image appeals for high-motivation donors, explicit incentives for others). The empirical literature thus supports the theoretical case for asset-based obligations while identifying the practical design requirements such norms would need to meet.


## Section 7: Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals that while each domain offers sophisticated treatments of related questions, significant gaps emerge at their intersection. These gaps collectively explain why the dominant income-based approach to philanthropic giving norms lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives, and they define the space within which the research project makes its contribution.

### 7.1 Absence of Systematic Comparison of Income vs. Asset Obligation Bases

The most striking gap spans the entire literature: despite extensive philosophical debate about *how much* one ought to give, there is remarkably little systematic analysis of *from what* giving obligations should be calculated. The demandingness literature extensively debates the stringency of beneficence requirements—whether \citet{singer1972famine} demands too much or \citet{murphy2000moral}'s cooperative principle appropriately limits obligations—but treats "resources" as an undifferentiated category. \citet{kagan1989limits} defends unlimited moral demands without specifying whether these apply to income flows, accumulated wealth, or both. Similarly, \citet{cullity2004moral}'s "life-altering demands" framework identifies when giving becomes supererogatory without distinguishing whether this threshold operates differently for income versus assets.

The effective altruism literature has converged on income-based norms through historical contingency rather than explicit justification. The Giving What We Can pledge operationalizes giving through income percentages, a structure \citet{macaskill2015doing} popularized without systematic argument for why income rather than wealth provides the appropriate base. \citet{aloyo2023effective} represents the most direct engagement with this question, raising the "net wealth objection" to fixed-percentage income norms. He argues that capacity-based giving better captures the reasons effective altruists give for charitable obligations, but does not develop a complete alternative framework specifying how assets should factor into obligation calculations.

This gap matters because without systematic comparison, we cannot determine whether dominant income-based norms actually optimize utilitarian objectives. If assets beyond security thresholds have lower marginal utility than income—as evidence from precautionary savings behavior \citep{horioka2020wealth, horioka2022retired} and positional goods theory \citep{shahar2017positional, walasek2017positional} suggests—current norms may substantially underutilize available philanthropic capacity. The research project directly addresses this gap by developing explicit criteria for comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions.

### 7.2 Disconnection Between Marginal Utility Theory and Philanthropic Norms

A second gap separates the empirical and theoretical literature on marginal utility from normative frameworks for philanthropic giving. Three distinct research programs support the claim that income and wealth exhibit different marginal utility profiles, yet none connects these findings to giving norm design.

The precautionary savings literature demonstrates that households accumulate wealth primarily for insurance and bequest purposes rather than consumption. \citet{horioka2020wealth} find that over 80% of retired Italian elderly engage in positive saving despite declining income needs, while \citet{painter2021housing} show that housing wealth operates primarily through precautionary motives with marginal propensity to consume of only 2.3%. These findings imply that wealth beyond security thresholds serves non-consumption functions with low marginal utility for the holder's welfare.

The positional goods literature provides complementary evidence. \citet{shahar2017positional} argues philosophically that wealth often functions as a relative rather than absolute good, diminishing its marginal contribution to welfare. \citet{walasek2017positional} demonstrate empirically that luxury brand consumption increases with inequality, suggesting wealth serves status-signaling purposes with low absolute welfare benefit. If much wealth accumulation beyond security thresholds serves positional rather than absolute welfare functions, its marginal utility is systematically lower than income used for direct consumption needs.

The sufficientarian literature introduces threshold concepts that could bridge these empirical findings with normative theory. \citet{hassoun2021sufficiency} develops practical accounts of sufficiency thresholds above which distribution matters less morally, while \citet{huseby2020sufficiency} proposes dual thresholds distinguishing urgent needs from security concerns. Yet these philosophical frameworks remain disconnected from precautionary wealth behavior and positional goods evidence.

The research project addresses this gap by synthesizing marginal utility evidence with utilitarian obligation theory. If marginal utility of assets beyond security thresholds is systematically lower than that of income, utilitarian theory may generate stronger obligations on assets than current income-based norms recognize. This synthesis requires integrating the economic evidence on wealth functions with the philosophical frameworks for specifying beneficence obligations.

### 7.3 Limited Application of Property and Limitarianism Theory to Voluntary Giving

A third gap concerns the relationship between property theory and voluntary giving norms. The philosophical literature offers sophisticated treatments of asset-based obligations in taxation contexts, but rarely extends these arguments to voluntary charitable norms.

\citet{murphy2002myth} fundamentally challenge the idea of pre-tax property rights, arguing that what individuals "deserve" can only be determined after specifying a legitimate tax system. This framework implies that both income and assets should be evaluated by their contribution to fair distribution rather than prior entitlements. \citet{robeyns2019extreme} develops limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings—grounded in both political equality concerns and the claim that surplus wealth above flourishing thresholds should address urgent unmet needs. \citet{halliday2018inheritance} demonstrates how wealth perpetuates intergenerational inequality in ways distinct from income, supporting special treatment of asset transfers.

Yet these arguments focus almost exclusively on taxation and mandatory redistribution rather than voluntary giving norms. \citet{pedersen2020distributive} examines income tax, wealth tax, and inheritance tax from multiple philosophical perspectives but does not address how these frameworks might inform voluntary charitable obligations. The extensive literature on property rights and duties of charity—including \citet{udi2015locke}'s reconciliation of Lockean property rights with enforceable distributive obligations—similarly focuses on what can be legally demanded rather than what individuals should voluntarily give.

This gap matters because if philosophical analysis supports treating assets distinctively for taxation purposes, parallel arguments may apply to voluntary giving. The considerations that justify progressive wealth taxation—accumulated assets represent lower marginal utility, contribute to political inequality, and perpetuate unearned advantage—could equally support asset-based charitable norms. The research project extends property and limitarianism frameworks to voluntary giving contexts, examining whether the same considerations that justify wealth taxation support asset-based charitable obligations.

### 7.4 Empirical Questions About Asset-Based Norm Feasibility

A fourth gap concerns the practical feasibility of asset-based giving norms. Even if such norms are theoretically justified, they may face implementation barriers that favor income-based alternatives as practical optima.

Behavioral research provides suggestive but incomplete evidence. \citet{drouvelis2019bonus} demonstrate that windfall income—which resembles drawing down assets—generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income, mediated by social norms about appropriate giving from different income sources. This suggests donors implicitly recognize differential marginal utility. However, no studies directly compare asset-based versus income-based commitment mechanisms.

The Giving Pledge represents the most prominent wealth-based commitment, yet \citet{schmitz2021billionaires} find its effectiveness difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and modest requirements. After a decade, actual follow-through rates remain unclear, contrasting with the growing participation data available for income-based pledges like Giving What We Can \citep{wilks2023who}. This asymmetry may reflect deeper challenges: income is more psychologically salient, easier to measure, and more amenable to social accountability than wealth \citep{caviola2021psychology}.

The meta-analytic evidence on social norms and charitable giving \citep{chapman2025social} shows moderate positive effects, with stronger impacts for injunctive norms (what one ought to do) than descriptive norms (what others do). This suggests that moral arguments for asset-based giving could influence behavior, but the finding that effects are strongest for close social referents implies that norm change may require grassroots movements rather than abstract philosophical arguments.

The research project addresses this gap by considering both theoretical justification and implementation feasibility. Even theoretically superior norms may face practical barriers—measurement difficulty, lower salience, weaker social accountability—that favor alternatives. The project identifies conditions under which asset-based norms would be preferable despite these challenges and develops strategies for addressing practical obstacles to their adoption.

### 7.5 Synthesis: The Research Opportunity

These four gaps collectively reveal that the dominant income-based approach to philanthropic giving norms represents a convergence of historical contingency, practical convenience, and theoretical inertia rather than systematic justification. The demandingness literature assumes undifferentiated "resources"; effective altruism operationalized through income without explicit argument; marginal utility research remains disconnected from normative frameworks; property and limitarianism theory focuses on taxation; and behavioral research lacks direct comparisons of income versus asset-based mechanisms.

The research project addresses this constellation of gaps by integrating marginal utility theory with utilitarian obligation frameworks, extending property and limitarianism philosophy to voluntary giving contexts, and evaluating both theoretical and practical considerations for asset-sensitive giving strategies. The central question—whether asset-based giving norms better capture utilitarian obligations than income-based alternatives—has been implicit in multiple literatures but never directly addressed. By making this question explicit and drawing on resources from each domain, the project occupies a distinctive and well-motivated position in the scholarly landscape.


## Conclusion

This review has traced the philosophical foundations and practical limitations of utilitarian giving norms, revealing a significant gap between theoretical sophistication and operational specification. From \citet{singer1972famine}'s foundational principle that we ought to prevent suffering when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to give. Yet the dominant operationalization of these obligations—the 10% income pledge championed by Giving What We Can and the effective altruism movement \citep{macaskill2015doing, macaskill2019definition}—lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives.

The convergence of evidence from multiple domains strengthens this critique. Empirical research on precautionary savings demonstrates that households accumulate wealth primarily for insurance and bequest purposes rather than consumption, with retired elderly continuing to save even as income declines \citep{horioka2020wealth}. The positional goods literature reveals that wealth beyond security thresholds functions largely as a relative good for status signaling, generating lower absolute marginal utility than income directed toward ongoing needs \citep{shahar2017positional, walasek2017positional}. Sufficientarian philosophy provides theoretical grounding for threshold effects: once basic security is achieved, additional resources matter less morally \citep{hassoun2021sufficiency}. Together, these strands converge on a crucial asymmetry: assets beyond security thresholds have systematically lower marginal utility than income flows directed toward current consumption.

This asymmetry has been largely overlooked in the demandingness debate. While philosophers have extensively analyzed whether utilitarian obligations are too demanding \citep{kagan1989limits, scheffler1982rejection, murphy2000moral, cullity2004moral}, and effective altruists have developed practical commitment mechanisms, neither tradition has systematically compared income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions. \citet{aloyo2023effective}'s critique of fixed-percentage giving begins to address this gap by proposing progressive giving based on capacity, but does not fully develop the theoretical case for wealth-sensitive frameworks.

The proposed research fills this gap by systematically comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms within a utilitarian framework. If the marginal utility asymmetry holds, the practical implications are significant: high-net-worth individuals may face substantially stronger obligations than income-based norms recognize, while middle-class donors with limited assets may appropriately face weaker demands on their income. This represents not merely a technical refinement but a potential reorientation of philanthropic norms—one that \citet{murphy2002myth} anticipated in noting that fair-share calculations must consider total resources, not merely income flows.

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. The analysis proceeds within utilitarian assumptions and may not address justice-based concerns about the sources of wealth \citep{robeyns2019extreme}, virtue-based considerations about charitable disposition, or structural critiques emphasizing systemic change over individual giving \citep{berkey2018institutional}. The psychological feasibility of asset-based commitments—given that wealth is less salient and more emotionally fraught than income \citep{schubert2024mind}—also requires empirical investigation. Nevertheless, the theoretical case for examining asset-sensitive alternatives to prevailing income-based norms is compelling, and the potential for more defensible philanthropic frameworks makes this investigation urgent.
