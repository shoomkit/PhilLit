====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The utilitarian theory of beneficence centers on the question of what impartial
welfarist utilitarianism requires agents to do for others, particularly those
in severe need. The domain is structured around two main tensions: first, the
"demandingness objection" - the charge that utilitarianism requires agents to
sacrifice their own projects and well-being to an intolerable degree; second,
the question of how to specify the scope and limits of obligations to aid.

Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972) established the foundational
position that affluent individuals have strong obligations to aid those in
extreme poverty, grounded in the principle that we ought to prevent bad things
from happening when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral
importance. This triggered extensive debate about whether such obligations are
too demanding. Kagan (1989) defended utilitarian demandingness, arguing that
commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest on faulty agent-centered
prerogatives. In response, Murphy (1993, 2000) proposed a "cooperative principle"
limiting individual obligations based on fair share of collective duty. Scheffler
(1982) developed the influential concept of agent-centered prerogatives allowing
agents to give extra weight to their own interests. Unger (1996) argued through
psychological puzzles that our intuitions systematically underestimate our
obligations. Cullity (2004) sought a middle ground, defending moderate rather
than extreme demands. More recently, Ashford (2003) argued that contractualism
faces comparably demanding obligations, while Portmore (2011) developed
"commonsense consequentialism" incorporating both consequentialist and
deontological elements. De Lazari-Radek and Singer (2017) defended classical
utilitarianism against demandingness objections by questioning the rational
basis of self-interested bias.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the theoretical foundations of the research
project's central question: what do utilitarian theories require regarding
charitable giving? The debate about demandingness illuminates whether utilitarian
obligations should be specified as income-based (e.g., 10% pledges) or
asset-based norms. The literature on agent-centered prerogatives, satisficing,
and cooperative principles provides frameworks for moderating demanding obligations
while maintaining utilitarian commitments. Understanding threshold approaches
(Murphy, Cullity) is particularly relevant to the project's investigation of
security thresholds beyond which marginal utility of assets decreases.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively discusses demandingness in terms of personal
projects and well-being, there is limited systematic treatment of the specific
distinction between income and assets as alternative bases for giving obligations.
The relationship between marginal utility of wealth at different asset levels
and the structure of giving obligations remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should trace the evolution from Singer's strong obligations through
various attempts to moderate demand (Scheffler, Murphy, Cullity) and defenses
of stringent requirements (Kagan, Unger). Special attention should be paid to
how threshold approaches and cooperative principles might inform asset-based
versus income-based giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong obligations (Singer, Kagan, Unger): 10 papers - Utilitarianism requires
  substantial sacrifice to aid those in need; demandingness objections fail
- Moderate obligations (Murphy, Scheffler, Cullity): 6 papers - Obligations to
  aid exist but are limited by agent-centered prerogatives or cooperative principles
- Theoretical foundations (SEP entries, recent defenses): 2 papers - Foundational
  work on consequentialism and beneficence principles

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening
  without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so.
  Applied to global poverty, this principle entails that affluent individuals have
  strong moral obligations to donate substantially to famine relief and development
  aid. Challenges the distinction between duty and charity, arguing that aiding
  those in extreme need is obligatory, not supererogatory. Defends a demanding
  consequentialist ethic that requires agents to give until marginal utility of
  further giving equals marginal cost to oneself.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the theoretical basis for strong
  utilitarian obligations to aid. Directly relevant to the project's examination
  of income versus asset-based giving norms, as Singer's principle could be applied
  to either base. His marginal utility framework is particularly relevant to the
  project's hypothesis about differential marginal utility of income versus assets
  beyond a security threshold.

  POSITION: Represents the strong demandingness position that will be central to
  debates throughout this domain. Sets up the core tension between utilitarian
  requirements and commonsense morality's limits on obligation.

  year = {1989},
  doi = {10.1093/0198239165.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends act-consequentialism against the charge of excessive
  demandingness, arguing that commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest
  on indefensible agent-centered prerogatives and constraints. Contends that
  there are no principled limits to moral demands - we are required to promote
  the good whenever we can. Challenges Scheffler's hybrid theory and argues that
  the appeal to personal projects and ground projects cannot justify departures
  from consequentialism. Maintains that consequentialism's demanding character is
  a feature, not a bug, reflecting morality's genuine requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most systematic philosophical defense of unlimited
  utilitarian demands against the demandingness objection. Critical for
  understanding the strongest utilitarian position on beneficence. Kagan's
  rejection of agent-centered prerogatives bears directly on whether utilitarian
  giving norms can accommodate personal wealth retention beyond bare necessities,
  relevant to the project's investigation of thresholds and marginal utility.

  POSITION: Represents uncompromising act-consequentialism rejecting any
  principled limits on moral demands. Establishes the strong pole against which
  moderate positions (Murphy, Cullity, Scheffler) define themselves.

  edition = {revised 1994},
  doi = {10.1093/0198235119.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a "hybrid theory" that preserves consequentialist
  concern for overall good while incorporating an "agent-centered prerogative"
  allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own interests and
  projects. Argues this prerogative is grounded in the independence and integrity
  of persons as distinct agents with their own perspectives. Defends this as a
  principled middle ground between pure consequentialism's excessive demands and
  deontology's rigid constraints. The prerogative allows agents not to maximize
  the good, but does not permit harming others.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces the influential concept of agent-centered prerogatives,
  which has structured subsequent debates about moderating utilitarian demands.
  Directly relevant to whether utilitarian giving norms can accommodate personal
  wealth retention for projects and commitments. Scheffler's framework might
  justify different giving requirements from income (closer to needs) versus
  assets (more connected to long-term projects and security).

  POSITION: Represents the moderate position attempting to preserve utilitarian
  concern for welfare while acknowledging limits on moral demands. Central to
  understanding how utilitarianism might be modified to be less demanding while
  retaining core commitments.

  journal = {Philosophy and Public Affairs},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that individual moral obligations to aid should be limited
  by a "cooperative principle" under which agents are required to do their fair
  share of the collective good that would result if all agents complied, rather
  than being required to compensate for others' non-compliance. Criticizes both
  Singer's demanding principle and Fishkin's more moderate approaches. Claims that
  in non-ideal conditions where not everyone does their part, individuals are not
  obligated to pick up the slack. This significantly reduces demands on compliant
  agents while maintaining that significant obligations to aid exist.

  RELEVANCE: Murphy's cooperative principle offers a structured way to limit
  utilitarian demands without abandoning core commitments to beneficence. Highly
  relevant to the project's investigation of giving norms, as the cooperative
  principle could support either income-based or asset-based thresholds depending
  on what fair share is calculated to require. The fair-share framework provides
  a way to specify moderate giving obligations (like 10% pledges) on utilitarian
  grounds.

  POSITION: Represents the cooperative/fair-share approach to limiting moral
  demands, distinct from both agent-centered prerogatives and satisficing
  strategies. Influential moderate position in the demandingness debate.

  address = {New York},
  year = {2000},
  doi = {10.1093/0198238975.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and defends the cooperative principle from Murphy (1993)
  in systematic detail. Argues for a "compliance condition" on moral principles
  that adjusts requirements based on actual rather than ideal compliance rates.
  Contends that beneficence principles should specify what agents ought to do
  assuming full compliance, with adjustments for partial compliance following
  fairness considerations. Criticizes consequentialist approaches that demand
  agents compensate for others' failures. Provides detailed application to
  questions of distributive justice and global poverty relief.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most developed articulation of the cooperative/fair-share
  approach to limiting beneficence demands. Essential for understanding how
  moderate utilitarian giving norms might be justified. Murphy's framework directly
  addresses the question of what percentage or amount constitutes fair share,
  relevant to evaluating income-based versus asset-based giving norms. The
  compliance condition framework could support differential treatment of income
  and assets based on their different roles in fair share calculations.

  POSITION: Extends the cooperative principle into a comprehensive moral theory
  for non-ideal conditions. Represents the most sophisticated attempt to limit
  utilitarian demands through fairness considerations rather than agent-centered
  prerogatives.

  address = {New York},
  year = {1996},
  doi = {10.1093/0195108590.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues through a series of psychological puzzles and thought
  experiments that our ordinary moral intuitions systematically underestimate our
  obligations to aid distant strangers in severe need. Contends that morally
  irrelevant psychological factors (physical proximity, directness of causal
  connection, salience) distort our judgments about obligations to aid. When these
  distorting factors are removed, we recognize stringent obligations to make
  substantial sacrifices to save lives. Defends demanding consequentialist
  conclusions through intuition-testing methodology rather than direct theoretical
  argument.

  RELEVANCE: Unger's psychological approach to defending demanding obligations
  provides an alternative route to strong beneficence requirements distinct from
  Kagan's theoretical arguments and Singer's principle. Relevant to the project's
  investigation of giving norms because Unger's puzzles suggest that intuitions
  about acceptable giving levels may be systematically biased. His focus on
  psychological distortions may apply differently to intuitions about giving from
  income versus assets.

  POSITION: Defends strong demandingness through psychological rather than purely
  theoretical arguments. Represents an important variant of the strong obligation
  position that appeals to hidden biases rather than explicit principles.

  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2004},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Seeks a middle ground between Singer's demanding requirements
  and complete rejection of obligation to distant strangers. Argues that we have
  significant but not extreme obligations to aid, based on analysis of when
  beneficent sacrifice becomes supererogatory rather than required. Introduces
  the concept of "life-altering demands" - requirements that would fundamentally
  change one's life plan - and argues these mark the boundary between obligation
  and supererogation. Defends moderate rather than minimal or maximal obligations
  through analysis of the iterative nature of beneficent demands and the structure
  of personal commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's life-altering demands framework provides a structured
  approach to specifying moderate giving obligations that avoids both extremes.
  Particularly relevant to the project's investigation of thresholds and marginal
  utility, as Cullity's framework suggests that obligations change at points where
  further giving would fundamentally alter life plans. This could support different
  treatment of income versus assets if assets are more closely tied to long-term
  life plans and security than current income.

  POSITION: Represents the moderate position seeking principled limits on
  beneficence short of agent-centered prerogatives or pure consequentialism.
  Influential contemporary attempt to find a defensible middle ground in the
  demandingness debate.

  volume = {113},
  number = {2},
  pages = {273--302},
  doi = {10.1086/342853},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues against the common view that contractualism provides
  less demanding obligations than utilitarianism. Contends that Scanlon's
  contractualist framework, properly understood, generates comparably stringent
  obligations to aid those in severe need. The key is that principles permitting
  non-aid could be reasonably rejected by those who would die without assistance.
  Challenges the assumption that demandingness is a distinctive problem for
  consequentialism - non-consequentialist theories face similar challenges when
  taking seriously the urgency of others' needs. Defends demanding obligations
  on contractualist rather than utilitarian grounds.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding that demandingness is not uniquely a
  utilitarian problem, which matters for evaluating whether utilitarian giving
  norms are distinctively problematic. Ashford's contractualist defense of
  demanding obligations suggests that the project's examination of asset-based
  versus income-based norms faces similar issues across different moral frameworks.
  The reasonable rejection criterion might support different giving requirements
  from income versus assets depending on which basis people in need could more
  reasonably reject.

  POSITION: Extends demandingness debates beyond consequentialism to show that
  contractualism faces similar challenges. Represents a non-utilitarian defense
  of demanding beneficence obligations.

  year = {2011},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195189254.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "commonsense consequentialism" that accommodates both
  consequentialist and commonsense deontological intuitions within a unified
  framework. Proposes a "dual-ranking" consequentialism that ranks outcomes both
  impersonally (by overall value) and relative to agents (by value to the agent).
  Argues this allows agent-centered options without abandoning consequentialist
  structure. Defends the view that agents have moral reasons to maximize both
  impersonal and agent-relative value, with agent-relative reasons providing
  options to favor one's own interests. Applies framework to demandingness,
  supererogation, and moral rationalism.

  RELEVANCE: Portmore's commonsense consequentialism offers a sophisticated way
  to preserve consequentialist commitments while moderating demands through
  agent-relative value rankings. Relevant to the project's investigation because
  the dual-ranking framework could support different treatment of income versus
  assets if they enter differently into agent-relative versus impersonal value
  rankings. Assets tied to security and long-term planning might carry more
  agent-relative value than current income, justifying different giving requirements.

  POSITION: Represents recent sophisticated attempt to reconcile consequentialism
  with moderate demands through formal framework rather than ad hoc modifications.

  pages = {11--32},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511817663.003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Updates and defends Singer's earlier arguments for strong
  obligations to distant strangers, responding to criticisms and addressing
  questions about scope and limits. Argues that geographical distance and lack
  of direct causal responsibility do not diminish obligations to aid. Defends
  the view that we should prevent serious harm when we can do so at modest cost,
  with "modest cost" interpreted as not requiring sacrifice of anything of
  comparable moral significance. Addresses questions about collective action and
  fairness in allocating burdens of aid.

  RELEVANCE: Provides Singer's mature position on beneficence obligations,
  incorporating responses to decades of criticism. Relevant to the project's
  investigation as it clarifies how Singer's principle should be applied in
  practice. The discussion of "modest cost" bears on whether income or assets
  provide a better basis for specifying giving requirements - if security is
  morally significant, asset-based thresholds might better track the "comparable
  moral significance" criterion.

  POSITION: Reaffirms and refines Singer's strong beneficence requirements in
  light of subsequent debate. Represents mature statement of demanding utilitarian
  obligations to distant strangers.

  number = {4},
  pages = {427--438},
  doi = {10.3917/rip.266.0427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends utilitarianism against the demandingness objection by
  arguing that the gap between utilitarian requirements and common sense morality
  has widened since Sidgwick's time, and that it is common sense morality, not
  utilitarianism, that needs to change. Contends that evolutionary explanations
  of self-interested bias undermine the rational foundation of objections to
  demanding requirements. Argues that from an impartial perspective, utilitarian
  demands are rationally defensible even if psychologically difficult. The changed
  conditions of global poverty and wealth make historical comparisons of
  demandingness misleading.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent philosophical defense of demanding utilitarianism
  against evolved biases. Relevant to the project's investigation because the
  evolutionary debunking argument might apply differently to attitudes about income
  versus assets - evolutionary pressures may have created stronger psychological
  attachments to stored resources (assets) than current flows (income). This could
  suggest that intuitions about asset-based giving requirements are more
  evolutionarily distorted than income-based intuitions.

  POSITION: Defends classical utilitarianism's demanding character through

  utilitarian position.

  number = {3},
  pages = {557--578},
  doi = {10.1086/652294},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the traditional distinction between negative duties
  (not to harm) and positive duties (to aid), arguing that many contemporary
  harms to distant strangers involve complex causal chains that blur this
  distinction. Introduces concept of "new harms" arising from global economic
  and political structures where affluent societies benefit from and contribute
  to conditions that harm distant poor. Argues this shifts obligations from mere
  beneficence to compensation or restitution, which are more stringent. The
  traditional framework underestimates obligations by treating structural harms
  as mere absence of aid.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative grounding for strong obligations to distant
  poor based on complicity in structural harm rather than pure beneficence. Relevant
  to the project's investigation because if Lichtenberg is right, obligations might
  extend to both income and assets as fruits of unjust global structures. The
  compensation framework might support asset-based giving requirements if assets
  represent accumulated benefits from unjust structures, while income-based
  requirements might better track current participation in harmful systems.

  POSITION: Reframes debates about beneficence obligations by emphasizing structural
  harm and complicity. Represents important alternative to pure beneficence-based

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198732624.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends utilitarianism against standard objections by developing
  a more sophisticated utilitarian framework. Argues that utilitarians can account
  for moral rights, justice, equality, legitimacy, democracy, and virtue within
  a utilitarian framework. On demandingness specifically, argues that adopting
  more complex forms of utilitarianism (including satisficing and threshold
  approaches) provides plausible responses to demandingness objections. Contends
  that utilitarianism need not be as demanding as critics assume while retaining
  core commitments to impartial concern for welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent comprehensive defense of sophisticated utilitarianism
  incorporating responses to demandingness. Relevant to the project as Woodard's
  discussion of thresholds and satisficing bears directly on whether utilitarian
  giving norms should be specified with thresholds (supporting asset-based
  approaches if security is the threshold) or continuous percentage requirements
  (supporting income-based approaches). The sophisticated utilitarian framework
  may provide resources for justifying either approach.

  POSITION: Represents recent attempt to show utilitarianism can accommodate

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between moral demands and rationality,
  defending "weak anti-rationalism" - the view that morality sometimes requires
  actions that are not rationally required. Argues this provides space for
  demanding moral requirements without implausibly claiming that rationality always
  requires maximizing moral value. Contends that Murphy and Scheffler's attempts
  to limit moral demands through rational constraints fail because they assume
  moral rationalism (that moral requirements must be rationally required). Allowing
  morality and rationality to come apart preserves demanding moral obligations
  while acknowledging rational limits.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical framework for maintaining demanding moral
  requirements while acknowledging that compliance may not always be rationally
  required. Relevant to the project's investigation of giving norms because the
  weak anti-rationalist framework could support either income-based or asset-based
  demanding requirements while acknowledging that full compliance may exceed
  rational requirements. This might help explain why even demanding utilitarian
  norms need not be unreasonable to propose or advocate.

  pages = {841--864},
  doi = {10.1086/373957},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between fairness considerations and
  beneficence obligations, arguing that Murphy's cooperative principle inadequately
  captures fairness constraints on beneficence. Contends that fairness in
  beneficence is not simply about fair shares of a cooperative scheme but involves
  more complex considerations about comparative sacrifice and the structure of
  moral relationships. Argues that both pure consequentialism and Murphy's approach
  fail to adequately capture fairness in the distribution of beneficence burdens.
  Proposes alternative framework giving fairness independent weight.

  RELEVANCE: Important critique of Murphy's influential cooperative principle,
  suggesting that the fair-share approach may be insufficient. Relevant to the
  project's investigation because Hurley's analysis suggests that fairness
  considerations in beneficence are more complex than simple percentage calculations
  would suggest. This might bear on whether income-based or asset-based norms
  better capture relevant fairness considerations - assets might matter for
  comparative sacrifice in ways that income percentages miss.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses "altruistic" objections to utilitarianism - cases where
  it seems permissible to make utility-decreasing sacrifices. Criticizes
  "dual-maximizing" approaches (like Portmore's) and proposes "variable-disregarding"
  utilitarianism that permits disregarding utility of those who consent. Argues
  this better handles cases where agents want to sacrifice their own utility for
  non-utilitarian reasons. The key innovation is making permissible disregarding
  depend on consent rather than agent-relativity. Provides formal framework for
  incorporating consent into utilitarian calculations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent innovative approach to moderating utilitarian demands
  through consent-based disregarding. Relevant to the project's investigation
  because the consent framework might apply differently to income versus assets -
  people might reasonably consent to disregarding marginal utility of assets beyond
  security thresholds while not consenting to disregarding utility of income needed
  for current consumption. This could support differential treatment of income
  and asset-based giving requirements.

  POSITION: Represents recent innovative modification of utilitarianism through

  principles. Contemporary contribution to demandingness debates.

  pages = {225--242},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.637.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Ashford's argument that contractualism is as demanding
  as utilitarianism. Argues that utilitarianism is even more demanding than commonly
  realized because both act- and rule-utilitarianism require extremely stringent
  duties to wild animals. If we take seriously the vast number of wild animals
  suffering in nature, utilitarian requirements extend far beyond duties to distant
  humans. Contends this shows utilitarianism's demandingness problem is more severe
  than Ashford suggests, and that contractualism can avoid these extended duties
  by appealing to reciprocity requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Extends demandingness debates to include duties to animals, showing
  that scope of beneficiaries matters enormously for utilitarian requirements.
  Less directly relevant to the project's specific focus on charitable giving to
  humans, but important for understanding full scope of utilitarian demands. The

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines demandingness objection in context of structural
  injustice theories, particularly Iris Marion Young's social connection model.
  Argues that while demandingness objection is commonly raised against utilitarian
  beneficence principles, it is rarely addressed in institutional theories of
  global justice that treat poverty as human rights violation. Contends that
  responsibility for structural injustice generates demanding requirements comparable
  to utilitarian beneficence, but through different routes. Questions what counts
  as "defensible and psychologically feasible conception of responsibility" in
  face of structural global injustice.

  RELEVANCE: Connects demandingness debates to structural injustice frameworks,
  showing that demanding requirements arise from multiple theoretical sources.
  Relevant to the project's investigation because structural responsibility for
  global poverty might ground obligations applicable to both income and assets,
  as both may derive from participation in unjust structures. The structural
  approach might support asset-based requirements if accumulated wealth represents
  sustained benefit from unjust systems.

  POSITION: Extends demandingness debates beyond utilitarian beneficence to
  structural injustice frameworks. Shows demandingness is broader philosophical
  challenge than utilitarian-specific problem.

DOMAIN: Marginal Utility Theory and Wealth

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the economic and philosophical foundations of diminishing
marginal utility as applied to wealth versus income. The literature reveals a
systematic distinction often overlooked in utilitarian theory: marginal utility
behaves differently for flow variables (income) versus stock variables (wealth/
assets). Classical utility theory, stemming from Bernoulli (1738), established
that money exhibits diminishing marginal utility - each additional dollar provides
less satisfaction than the previous one. However, modern behavioral economics
reveals this principle requires refinement when distinguishing income from wealth.

The key insight is that wealth accumulation beyond a security threshold serves
different functions than income. While income addresses ongoing consumption needs
with relatively high marginal utility, accumulated assets primarily serve as
insurance against uncertainty (precautionary motive), positional signaling, or
bequest motives - all of which exhibit lower marginal utility. Recent work on
positional goods (Walasek et al. 2017, Shahar 2017) demonstrates that wealth
often functions as a relative rather than absolute good, diminishing its marginal
utility for welfare. The precautionary savings literature (Horioka & Ventura 2020,
Painter et al. 2021) shows that households accumulate wealth primarily for
insurance, not consumption, which fundamentally changes marginal utility calculations.

The sufficientarian literature (Hassoun 2021, Huseby 2020, Bossert et al. 2021)
introduces the concept of sufficiency thresholds - levels above which distribution
matters less morally. This provides philosophical grounding for the empirical
observation that marginal utility of wealth drops sharply after basic security
needs are met, while income continues to bear higher marginal utility for ongoing
needs.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central question of whether utilitarian giving
norms should focus on income (flow) or wealth (stock) thresholds. The literature
provides both theoretical and empirical support for distinguishing these variables:
beyond a security threshold, assets exhibit lower marginal utility than income
due to their role in insurance, status-seeking, and bequest rather than direct
consumption. This asymmetry suggests that asset-based giving norms may better
capture utilitarian obligations than income-based norms like the 10% pledge.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers directly compare marginal utility of income versus wealth within the
same framework. The connection between sufficientarian thresholds and precautionary
wealth motives remains under-theorized. Limited philosophical attention to how
positional aspects of wealth affect utilitarian calculations. The role of wealth
thresholds in determining charitable obligations is rarely addressed explicitly.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesize the precautionary savings literature with sufficientarian philosophy
to argue for wealth-based thresholds. Connect positional goods theory to the
low marginal utility of excess assets. Contrast the consumption-focused marginal
utility of income with the insurance/status-focused marginal utility of wealth.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical diminishing marginal utility: 6 papers - Marginal utility decreases with wealth but doesn't distinguish income from assets
- Precautionary wealth theory: 4 papers - Assets primarily serve insurance function with low marginal utility
- Positional goods theory: 4 papers - Wealth serves relative status function, reducing absolute marginal utility
- Sufficientarianism: 4 papers - Above threshold, distribution matters less; supports differential treatment of assets

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The standard expected utility model, which derives risk aversion
  from diminishing marginal utility of wealth, faces serious empirical challenges.
  The authors argue that while this model has generated important insights,
  alternative models can better capture basic risk aversion intuitions without
  tying them exclusively to wealth's marginal utility. They show that models
  allowing separate treatment of risk preferences and wealth effects can produce
  more nuanced predictions about behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's distinction between income and
  wealth. The paper demonstrates that marginal utility of wealth is conceptually
  separable from risk aversion, suggesting wealth accumulation may serve functions
  beyond direct consumption utility. This supports the argument that wealth beyond
  security thresholds has different marginal utility properties than income flows,
  as wealth may primarily address risk/insurance motives rather than consumption.

  POSITION: Critiques standard neoclassical utility theory; argues for refined
  models distinguishing risk preferences from consumption utility.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Observed risk aversion over small gambles is difficult to explain
  via diminishing marginal utility of wealth alone, as Rabin (2000) demonstrated.
  The authors propose that risk aversion results from imprecise mental
  representations rather than wealth effects. They show experimentally that
  people exhibit substantial risk aversion over small stakes that cannot be
  rationalized by any plausible degree of diminishing marginal utility of wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Provides crucial evidence that diminishing marginal utility of wealth
  cannot fully explain observed behavior, suggesting wealth has psychological/
  functional roles beyond direct consumption. This supports distinguishing wealth
  from income in utilitarian calculations: if marginal utility of wealth is
  insufficient to explain risk behavior, wealth likely serves non-consumption
  purposes (insurance, status) with different utility profiles than income.

  pages = {138--148},
  doi = {10.1002/JCPY.1012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using millions of Twitter posts, the authors show that mentions
  of luxury/high-status brands (like Rolex, Louis Vuitton) are more frequent in
  U.S. regions with higher income inequality, while everyday brands are mentioned
  more in equal-income regions. This provides large-scale empirical evidence that
  consumption of positional goods increases when the income gap is larger,
  supporting the social rank hypothesis that people allocate more psychological
  resources to status consumption when inequality is high.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates empirically that wealth/assets function as positional
  goods for status signaling, especially in unequal societies. This implies the
  marginal utility of wealth beyond basic needs is largely relative rather than
  absolute - it serves to signal position rather than increase objective welfare.
  This positional aspect dramatically reduces the absolute marginal utility of
  excess wealth, supporting the project's argument that assets above security
  thresholds have lower utilitarian value than income.

  POSITION: Behavioral/empirical support for positional goods theory; demonstrates
  wealth's status-signaling function reduces its absolute welfare benefit.

  number = {1},
  pages = {103--120},
  doi = {10.1111/JOPP.12118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The existence of positional goods - goods whose value depends on
  one's relative position - provides a distinct egalitarian concern independent
  of prioritarian or sufficientarian worries. When goods are positional, the
  marginal welfare benefit of additional consumption decreases not just because
  of diminishing marginal utility, but because relative position matters. Shahar
  argues this creates a unique moral reason to limit inequality in positional
  goods beyond standard welfare concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical grounding for the claim that wealth beyond
  security serves primarily positional purposes with low absolute marginal utility.
  The paper's analysis suggests that accumulated assets, which often function as
  positional goods (luxury housing, investment portfolios), generate less welfare
  per marginal dollar than income used for direct consumption. This supports
  asset-based rather than income-based giving thresholds in utilitarian frameworks.

  doi = {10.1080/00048402.2019.1620816},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Most analysis of positional goods focuses on downstream
  competition among consumers, but the authors argue that "upstream agency" -
  the actions of those who create and allocate positional goods (like elite
  universities, employers) - deserves more philosophical attention. They develop
  a taxonomy of upstream agents and analyze the moral demands on those who
  control access to positional goods, arguing these agents bear special
  responsibilities for resulting inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Extends positional goods theory to consider how access to positional
  assets is created and controlled. This is relevant to the project because it
  shows wealth accumulation beyond security often involves competition for
  positional goods (elite schooling, exclusive housing) where marginal utility
  is inherently relative. The analysis supports treating wealth differently from
  income in utilitarian frameworks, as wealth increasingly serves positional
  rather than absolute welfare functions.

  pages = {263--283},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820820000497},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sufficiency theorists claim we must provide everyone with
  "enough," but few well-worked-out accounts of the sufficiency threshold exist.
  Hassoun proposes a mechanism for arriving at an account of the minimally good
  life that can help locate the sufficiency threshold. She argues this threshold
  should be based on what people need to function as autonomous agents and live
  minimally good lives, going beyond basic needs but falling short of full
  flourishing. The threshold is independently specifiable and provides practical
  policy guidance.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for the concept of sufficiency
  thresholds that is central to the project's argument about wealth versus income.
  If there exists a specifiable threshold above which additional resources matter
  less morally, this supports treating wealth above this threshold differently
  than income. The paper's analysis suggests that once security needs are met
  through adequate assets, the marginal moral importance of additional wealth
  decreases sharply, while income continues to address ongoing needs.

  doi = {10.1007/s10892-020-09321-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the "threshold objection" to sufficientarianism: how
  can there be a sharp threshold such that distribution is highly important just
  below it but not required at all above it? Huseby proposes that sufficientarianism
  requires two separate thresholds that may or may not overlap - one marking where
  urgent needs are met, another marking where additional benefits become less
  morally important. This two-threshold structure avoids the counterintuitive
  discontinuity while preserving sufficientarian insights.

  RELEVANCE: The two-threshold approach maps well onto the income/wealth distinction
  in the project. A lower threshold (basic consumption needs) and upper threshold
  (security through adequate assets) could justify different treatment of income
  versus wealth. Below the lower threshold, both income and assets are urgent;
  between thresholds, income for consumption remains important while additional
  assets for security become saturated; above the upper threshold, both matter
  less but wealth (serving mainly positional purposes) even more so.

  doi = {10.1111/jopp.12267},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a formal axiological framework for sufficientarianism
  based on absolute priority to those below a threshold. The authors combine
  sufficientarian principles with utilitarian axioms to derive "critical-level
  sufficientarianism," which applies critical-level generalized utilitarianism
  below the threshold and uses it as a tie-breaker above. They prove this is the
  unique class of rankings satisfying both absolute priority and utilitarian
  continuity conditions, providing rigorous foundations for sufficiency views.

  RELEVANCE: Provides rigorous formal framework for incorporating thresholds into
  utilitarian theory. The absolute priority principle supports the project's claim
  that resources below a sufficiency threshold (whether income or wealth) demand
  urgent attention, while resources above matter less. The framework allows for
  different treatment of income and wealth if they relate differently to the
  threshold - income addressing ongoing needs, wealth addressing security threshold.

  pages = {575--597},
  doi = {10.1007/s11150-020-09486-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Italian household panel data, the authors find that retired
  elderly decumulate wealth much more slowly than expected - more than 40% continue
  accumulating wealth and over 80% do positive saving. Regression analysis reveals
  this slower-than-expected decumulation is due primarily to bequest motives and
  precautionary saving (especially the former). This demonstrates the "Wealth
  Decumulation Puzzle": even in retirement when income is low, people hold onto
  assets for non-consumption purposes.

  RELEVANCE: Provides strong empirical evidence that wealth serves fundamentally
  different purposes than income - primarily bequest and insurance motives rather
  than consumption. This supports the project's core claim: assets beyond security
  thresholds have low marginal utility for the holder's consumption, as evidenced
  by retirees not consuming them despite low income. This asymmetry between wealth
  (held for non-consumption reasons) and income (consumed for ongoing needs)
  justifies different utilitarian treatment of the two.

  pages = {327--363},
  doi = {10.1007/s11150-021-09578-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extending their Italian analysis to multiple European countries
  using SHARE data, the authors find less than half of retired elderly decumulate
  wealth and average wealth accumulation is positive (6.6% over 3 years). This
  pan-European evidence confirms the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle applies broadly.
  Regression results attribute slow decumulation to bequest motives, generous
  public pensions (reducing need to consume assets), and reluctance to liquidate
  owner-occupied housing - all non-consumption motives for holding wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Broadens empirical support across Europe for the claim that wealth
  serves non-consumption purposes (insurance, bequest, housing security) with
  lower marginal utility than income. The finding that generous pensions (higher
  income) allow wealth retention demonstrates the distinction: when income needs
  are met, people don't consume assets, revealing assets' primary functions are
  insurance and bequest. This systematic difference supports asset-based rather
  than income-based giving thresholds.

  doi = {10.1017/S0022109021000065},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Chinese household panel data where housing equity cannot
  be withdrawn (eliminating collateral channel), the authors isolate the wealth
  effect of housing on consumption. They find a 1% housing wealth increase raises
  consumption by 0.14% (marginal propensity to consume of 0.023). Crucially, this
  effect is largest among employees facing greater income uncertainty, demonstrating
  that housing wealth operates primarily through precautionary savings motives
  rather than direct consumption.

  RELEVANCE: Provides clean empirical evidence that wealth accumulation (here,
  housing) serves primarily as insurance against income uncertainty, with very
  low marginal propensity to consume (2.3%). This directly supports the project's
  argument: wealth's main function is precautionary/insurance with low marginal
  consumption utility, while income addresses direct consumption needs with higher
  marginal utility. The finding that this pattern is strongest for those with
  income uncertainty further distinguishes wealth's insurance role from income's
  consumption role.

  journal = {SocArXiv},

  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/xsqzp},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: While universal basic income (UBI) is often defended on
  utilitarian grounds for increasing welfare, the author argues a non-universal
  basic income adjusted for prior income and wealth would better maximize welfare.
  The key insight is applying diminishing marginal utility correctly: those with
  lower prior income and wealth benefit more from transfers. Therefore, a means-
  tested system targeting the poor is more effective at maximizing total and
  average welfare than a universal system giving equal amounts regardless of
  existing resources.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applies diminishing marginal utility to policy design,
  demonstrating that prior wealth and income matter for determining marginal
  utility of transfers. This supports the project's core claim that marginal
  utility calculations should consider both income and wealth stocks. The argument
  that adjusted transfers maximize welfare better than universal ones parallels
  the argument that giving norms should consider accumulated assets, not just
  income flows, when determining obligations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to the objection that sufficientarianism is objectionably
  indifferent to distribution above the threshold. Kanschik argues sufficientarianism
  warrants progressive taxation because even those above sufficiency face risks
  of falling below it, and this risk decreases the better off someone is. Those
  closer to the threshold face greater risk of insufficiency, justifying
  progressive taxation that corresponds to distance from threshold rather than
  prioritarian or egalitarian concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical justification for differential treatment based
  on distance from sufficiency threshold, relevant to the project's argument about
  wealth thresholds. The risk-based rationale applies well to asset holdings:
  those with minimal assets face high risk of falling into poverty (high marginal
  utility of additional assets), while those with substantial assets face low
  risk (low marginal utility of additional assets). This supports progressive
  obligations based on wealth holdings.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the tension between ecological sufficiency (limiting

  fair distribution below those limits, and if limits are genuinely necessary for

  RELEVANCE: Extends sufficiency thinking to ecological contexts, relevant to the

  consumption limits, and wealth beyond thresholds often enables excess consumption
  (luxury goods, multiple properties), then sufficiency arguments support limits
  on wealth accumulation for ecological as well as distributive reasons. The

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how wealth holdings affect labor market productivity
  and job matching. The authors find that wealth reduces work effort and job
  search intensity, creating labor market inefficiencies. Workers with more wealth
  can afford to be more selective about jobs and work less intensively, suggesting
  wealth provides insurance/optionality that affects behavior beyond direct
  consumption. This wealth effect on labor supply implies wealth's marginal utility
  operates through option value and flexibility rather than consumption.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that wealth affects behavior through insurance/optionality
  mechanisms distinct from consumption, supporting the project's claim about
  wealth's different marginal utility function. The finding that wealth reduces
  labor effort suggests wealth above security thresholds provides option value
  rather than consumption utility - a fundamentally different function than income.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether public provision of positional goods can address
  inefficiencies from excessive private consumption driven by relative-standing

  positional purposes (luxury housing, exclusive education), its marginal social
  utility is low due to relative-standing externalities - one person's gain is
  another's loss. This positional aspect implies wealth beyond security has even

  CORE ARGUMENT: Investigates the origins of positional concerns using experimental
  and survey methods. The authors find substantial heterogeneity in which goods
  people consider positional and in the strength of positional concerns across
  individuals. They identify that positional concerns stem partly from innate
  preferences but are also shaped by social context and experience with inequality.
  The findings suggest positionality is not fixed but responds to institutional
  and cultural factors.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that positional aspects of consumption vary by good type
  and individual, with implications for wealth versus income. Wealth holdings
  (property, investments, luxury goods) are more likely to be treated as positional
  than income flows used for ordinary consumption. This differential positionality
  implies wealth's marginal utility is more affected by relative-standing concerns
  than income's, further supporting the asymmetry central to the project's argument.

  POSITION: Behavioral/experimental evidence on positional preferences; shows
  heterogeneity in positional concerns across goods and people.

====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

Effective altruism (EA) is both a philosophical movement and practical framework
that emerged in the early 2010s, advocating for using evidence and reason to
determine how to benefit others as much as possible with limited resources. The
movement's philosophical foundations draw on utilitarian principles while
attempting to remain theoretically ecumenical. MacAskill's "Doing Good Better"
(2015) and the edited volume by Greaves and Pummer (2019) provide foundational
texts. Singer's earlier "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972) laid crucial
groundwork with its argument for stringent obligations to prevent suffering.

The Giving What We Can (GWTC) pledge represents EA's most visible commitment
mechanism: pledgers commit to donating at least 10% of lifetime income to
effective charities. This income-based norm has generated both participation
(Wilks et al. 2023 found distinctive psychological profiles among pledgers)
and philosophical scrutiny. Aloyo (2023) critiques the 10% threshold,
arguing for progressive giving based on capacity rather than fixed percentages.
This debate connects directly to questions about whether giving norms should
track income, wealth, or some other metric of capacity.

Major critiques cluster around three themes: (1) Philosophical critiques
question EA's utilitarian commitments and impartiality demands (Gabriel 2017,
McMahan 2016); (2) Institutional critiques argue EA neglects systemic change
in favor of individual donations (Berkey 2017, Dietz 2019); (3) Justice-based
critiques contend EA sidesteps questions of equality, rights, and structural
injustice (Rubenstein 2016, Crary 2023). Recent work explores EA's relationship
to democracy (Lechterman 2020), religious traditions (Roser et al. 2022), and
its psychological underpinnings (Caviola et al. 2021, Schubert & Caviola 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses the research question about income-based vs.
asset-based giving norms. The 10% income pledge represents the paradigmatic
income-based norm in contemporary utilitarian philanthropy. Aloyo's progressive
giving proposal and the broader EA literature on demandingness provide crucial
context for evaluating whether marginal utility considerations favor shifting
from income to asset-based metrics. The critiques also illuminate potential
limitations of purely utilitarian approaches to charitable obligations.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Despite extensive discussion of "how much to give," there is surprisingly little
explicit analysis of *what* to give from (income vs. wealth/assets). The pledge
literature focuses almost entirely on income, with minimal consideration of
whether high-net-worth individuals' asset holdings should factor into giving
obligations. The relationship between EA's "earning to give" strategy and wealth
accumulation also remains underexplored relative to obligations based on existing
wealth.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Key papers to prioritize: MacAskill (2019) for EA definition; Aloyo (2023) for
progressive giving; Wilks et al. (2023) for empirical pledge data; Gabriel (2017),
Berkey (2017) for major critiques; Singer (1972) for foundational obligations
argument. The synthesis should trace how EA moved from Singer's abstract
principles to concrete pledge mechanisms, noting the gap between theoretical
flexibility and practical income-centrism.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Standard EA: 10% of income (Giving What We Can pledge) - 3 papers
- Progressive giving: Capacity-based rather than fixed percentage (Aloyo) - 1 paper
- Institutional critique: Focus on systemic change over individual giving - 4 papers
- Philosophical critique: Challenge utilitarian/impartial foundations - 5 papers
- Empirical research: Psychology and demographics of effective altruists - 3 papers
- Sympathetic defenses: EA as broad framework, not rigid doctrine - 2 papers

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill provides the canonical definition of effective altruism as the project of using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. Importantly, he distinguishes EA from strict utilitarianism, arguing EA is theoretically ecumenical and compatible with various moral frameworks. He addresses common misconceptions: EA is not just about poverty, not just about donations, and does not ignore systemic change.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how EA self-defines and what theoretical commitments it actually makes versus those attributed to it by critics. MacAskill's emphasis on EA as a "project" rather than a complete moral theory is crucial for evaluating whether income-based giving norms are intrinsic to EA or merely conventional. His discussion of "doing the most good we can" with "the resources in our possession" opens questions about which resources (income vs. wealth) should count.

  POSITION: Definitional/foundational work by EA's primary philosophical architect, emphasizing theoretical flexibility while maintaining practical commitment to effectiveness metrics.

  title = {Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference},
  publisher = {Gotham Books},
  address = {New York},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill's popular introduction to effective altruism argues that conventional charity often fails to maximize impact due to lack of rigorous evaluation. He introduces frameworks for comparing charitable interventions (focusing on scale, tractability, neglectedness) and defends "earning to give" as a potentially high-impact career path. The book promotes the 10% giving pledge as an accessible commitment mechanism while acknowledging more demanding obligations may apply.

  RELEVANCE: This is the movement's primary public-facing text and established many EA conventions, including the prominence of the 10% income pledge. The "earning to give" discussion is particularly relevant to the research question: if high earners should maximize income to donate 10%, what role do accumulated assets play? MacAskill focuses on income flows rather than stock of wealth, which may reflect an implicit assumption that deserves scrutiny.

  POSITION: Popularization of EA principles with emphasis on practical giving mechanisms; influential in establishing income-based norms as EA standard.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1080/16544951.2023.2246257},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal for a 10% giving norm (tithing) on four grounds: demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustices. He argues that a progressive giving principle better captures the reasons EA theorists give for charitable obligations. Progressive giving would scale with capacity rather than applying a fixed percentage, addressing concerns that 10% is too demanding for low earners and insufficiently demanding for the wealthy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the research question by challenging income-based percentage norms and proposing capacity-based alternatives. Aloyo's "net wealth" objection is particularly salient: he argues giving norms should consider total resources, not just income flows. This suggests assets matter morally for determining obligations, potentially supporting a shift toward wealth-based or capacity-based metrics. The paper represents the most explicit philosophical engagement with the income vs. asset question in EA literature.

  POSITION: Progressive giving based on capacity; challenges fixed-percentage income norms as insufficiently sensitive to individual circumstances and resources.

  doi = {10.1111/jopy.12842},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This empirical study (N=536) examines psychological and cognitive traits distinguishing Giving What We Can pledgers from matched controls. Pledgers showed better fearful face recognition, greater moral circle expansion, higher actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition, and higher utilitarian inclinations. Contrary to predictions, pledgers scored lower on maximizing tendency. The findings suggest pledgers are a distinctive population characterized by expanded moral concern combined with analytical thinking.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence about who actually makes and keeps the 10% income pledge, offering insight into whether income-based commitment mechanisms attract a particular demographic or psychological profile. The study's finding that pledgers expand their moral circles but don't simply maximize suggests complexity in EA motivations beyond simple utility calculation. Understanding who commits to income-based pledges helps evaluate whether such norms effectively capture those with genuine capacity to give.

  doi = {10.4324/9781315254210-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. Applied to global poverty, this principle generates demanding obligations: affluent individuals should give until they reach marginal utility (the point where giving more would cause comparable harm to themselves). Singer distinguishes strong and weak versions but suggests even the weak version requires radical changes in giving behavior.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper established the philosophical basis for demanding obligations to aid that EA later operationalized. Crucially, Singer's principle is framed in terms of preventing bad outcomes, not specific resource bases (income vs. wealth). The marginal utility standard could apply to either income or accumulated assets. EA's operationalization through income-based pledges represents one implementation, but Singer's abstract principle doesn't mandate income focus. This gap between theory and practice is central to evaluating alternative giving norms.

  pages = {457--473},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.12176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically evaluates three major critiques of EA: (1) the justice critique (EA neglects equality, rights, and urgency); (2) the methodological critique (EA's emphasis on quantification creates bias); and (3) the systemic change critique (EA focuses on symptoms rather than root causes). He argues critics overstate their case but identifies legitimate concerns about EA's tendency to sideline justice considerations and its methodological limitations in domains difficult to quantify.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive overview of EA criticisms helps situate the income vs. wealth question within broader debates. The justice critique is particularly relevant: if EA's utilitarian framework inadequately addresses distributive justice, this might extend to questions about fair taxation of wealth vs. income. The methodological critique also applies—income is easier to measure and track than wealth, which may explain EA's practical focus on income despite theoretical neutrality.

  POSITION: Systematic evaluation of EA critiques; finds partial merit in justice and methodological concerns while defending EA's core commitments.

  year = {2018},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey defends EA against the "institutional critique," which claims EA unjustifiably neglects institutional change in favor of individual charitable giving. He argues this critique either (1) mischaracterizes EA's core commitments, which are compatible with working for institutional change, or (2) fails to show that pursuing institutional change would be more effective than EA's current approaches. EA's emphasis on effectiveness means it should pursue institutional reform if that proves most impactful.

  RELEVANCE: The institutional critique connects to the income vs. wealth question indirectly: if EA's individualistic focus on donation pledges obscures structural questions (like wealth taxation), this represents a limitation. Berkey's defense suggests EA is theoretically open to institutional approaches but has pragmatically focused on individual giving. Whether income-based pledges represent genuine EA commitments or practical compromises affects how readily EA could adopt alternative frameworks, including wealth-based approaches.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume collects philosophical analyses of EA from various perspectives. Contributors examine EA's relationship to utilitarianism, demandingness, common-sense morality, and partiality. The volume includes both sympathetic refinements of EA principles and substantial criticisms. Chapters address theoretical foundations, practical applications, and EA's treatment of future generations and non-human animals.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most comprehensive philosophical treatment of EA to date. Multiple chapters engage questions about demandingness and what resources EA obligations apply to, though surprisingly little explicitly addresses income vs. wealth distinctions. The volume's theoretical depth helps ground evaluation of whether EA's practical conventions (like income-based pledges) follow from its philosophical commitments or represent contingent choices.

  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820818000158},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz argues that EA's individualistic framework inadequately addresses collective obligations. In situations where coordinated group action would produce better outcomes than uncoordinated individual optimization, EA's principle of "do the most good you can" may be self-defeating. He uses formal analysis of collective action problems to show that individual-level EA reasoning can lead to suboptimal collective outcomes, suggesting EA needs an account of collective obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Collective action framing applies to wealth taxation debates: individual voluntary asset-based giving may be less effective than coordinated policy changes (e.g., wealth taxes). If EA cannot adequately address collective obligations, this limits its ability to evaluate structural alternatives to individual income-based pledges. The paper suggests EA's individualistic focus may miss important moral considerations about fair schemes of taxation and redistribution.

  POSITION: Critique of EA's individualism; argues EA needs to incorporate collective obligation framework to avoid coordination failures.

  pages = {596--607},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.1016/j.tics.2021.03.015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This review synthesizes research on psychological barriers to effective giving. People preferentially help identifiable victims over statistical victims, favor local over distant causes, and weight "warm glow" feelings over impact. Scope insensitivity means people don't proportionally increase giving as numbers helped increase. The authors argue understanding these biases can help design interventions to promote more effective altruism while respecting psychological realities.

  RELEVANCE: The psychological barriers to EA may extend to wealth-based giving norms. Income is more psychologically salient and easier to track than wealth, which may explain conventional focus on income-based pledges despite wealth being a better proxy for capacity. The paper's discussion of identifiability effects also suggests why concrete income-based commitments (like "10% of salary") may be more motivating than abstract wealth-based obligations, even if the latter are more justified.

  doi = {10.1017/S0892679416000484},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rubenstein offers a sympathetic but critical analysis of EA, arguing it has important lessons for aid practitioners while harboring problematic commitments. EA's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and evidence is valuable, but its neglect of political context, rights-based frameworks, and power asymmetries is concerning. She illustrates with case of a librarian who donated $1M locally versus to "most effective" global charities, arguing EA's dismissal of local giving overlooks legitimate moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: The librarian case illustrates how EA's maximizing framework can conflict with other moral considerations, including communal obligations and gratitude. Applied to giving norms, this suggests income-based pledges may be easier to universalize while wealth-based obligations might involve more complex contextual factors (e.g., inherited vs. earned wealth, illiquid assets). Rubenstein's emphasis on non-utilitarian moral considerations points to limitations of purely effectiveness-based frameworks for setting giving standards.

  doi = {10.5840/tpm20167379},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMahan, while broadly sympathetic to EA, critiques philosophical attacks on the movement as often "derisive" and "weak in argument." He notes critics often ridicule EA practitioners' personal sacrifices rather than engaging substantive philosophical issues. McMahan argues disagreements center on means rather than ends—critics share EA's goal of preventing suffering but dispute whether EA's methods are optimal. He calls for more constructive engagement with EA's empirical claims about effectiveness.

  RELEVANCE: McMahan's meta-critique suggests evaluating EA requires distinguishing its core ethical commitments from its practical conventions. If critics and defenders share concern for suffering prevention but dispute implementation, the income vs. wealth question becomes an empirical matter about which resource base better operationalizes shared values. His call for engagement with evidence rather than dismissal applies to evaluating alternative giving norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Crary offers a radical critique arguing EA is "philosophically bankrupt and politically pernicious" despite apparent good intentions. EA's compatibility with capitalism and failure to address root causes of suffering make it counterproductive. She combines the institutional critique (EA ignores systemic change) with philosophical critique (EA's ethical framework is flawed) into a "composite critique" arguing EA should be abandoned rather than reformed.

  RELEVANCE: Crary's critique represents the strongest form of rejection of EA's entire framework, including any discussion of giving norms within that framework. If EA's fundamental approach is misguided, debates about income vs. wealth-based obligations within EA are beside the point—the entire project needs replacement. However, even if this radical critique fails, Crary's emphasis on EA's compatibility with existing economic structures raises questions about whether income-focused pledges simply accommodate rather than challenge wealth inequality.

  pages = {88--115},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1086/706867},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lechterman argues EA faces an unresolved tension between its depoliticized charitable approach and the inherently political nature of addressing global poverty and suffering. EA's emphasis on individual donation decisions sidesteps questions about political obligations, democratic legitimacy, and structural reform. This creates a "political problem": EA cannot remain neutral about politics while effectively addressing problems with fundamentally political causes and solutions.

  RELEVANCE: The political dimension extends to debates about giving norms. Income-based voluntary pledges represent an individualist, market-friendly approach, while wealth-based taxation would require collective political action. EA's difficulty engaging with politics may explain its practical focus on individual income-based commitments rather than advocacy for structural wealth redistribution. If Lechterman is right that EA's depoliticization is problematic, this strengthens the case for considering politically-mediated alternatives to voluntary income-based giving.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197757376.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book synthesizes psychological research on effective altruism, explaining why people resist EA principles and how to overcome these barriers. Part I examines cognitive biases (scope insensitivity, identifiability, in-group bias) that lead to ineffective giving. Part II discusses interventions—information, nudges, incentives, and value change—to increase effectiveness. The authors argue EA requires both understanding human psychology and designing systems that work with rather than against psychological tendencies.

  RELEVANCE: Understanding psychological barriers to EA helps evaluate feasibility of different giving norms. Income-based pledges may succeed partly because income is psychologically salient and easy to commit to, while wealth-based obligations face practical and psychological obstacles (wealth harder to measure, more emotionally fraught, involves assets people see as "theirs" in different ways than income flows). The book's discussion of commitment mechanisms also illuminates why public pledges based on transparent metrics (income) may be more effective than complex capacity-based formulas.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines effective altruism from various religious perspectives (Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Islamic). Contributors explore both synergies (shared concern for helping others effectively) and tensions (EA's utilitarianism vs. religious ethics, EA's secular framework vs. faith-based motivations). The book argues religious communities can both learn from and contribute to EA conversations, particularly around virtue ethics, community, and non-consequentialist moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Religious tithing traditions provide historical precedent for income-based giving norms (the 10% GWTC pledge echoes religious tithes). However, religious frameworks often include wealth-based obligations too (e.g., Islamic zakat applies to assets, not just income). The religious dialogue illuminates how different moral traditions operationalize giving obligations, potentially offering alternatives to EA's utilitarian framework while maintaining concern for effectiveness.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques "Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism" (OOEA) for demanding impartial maximization that prohibits helping those near to us. She proposes Mutual Aid as a morally superior alternative: community-based networks of reciprocal support that honor partiality, build solidarity, and address suffering through empathy and care rather than optimization. Mutual Aid, she argues, discharges our duty to address human suffering without EA's problematic impartiality demands.

  RELEVANCE: Pearlman's critique challenges the entire framework of optimizing individual giving (whether income or wealth-based), proposing instead community-oriented reciprocal support. This represents a fundamental alternative to EA's approach. However, if some version of EA's concern for effectiveness is valid, the question becomes whether Mutual Aid and EA approaches are complementary rather than exclusive. The debate illustrates how different moral frameworks generate different giving norms and priorities.

  CORE ARGUMENT: In response to Pearlman's critique, Mouser argues mutual aid and effective altruism are compatible and mutually enriching rather than opposed. EA's overreliance on charity keeps it on a "firefighter's treadmill" of marginal gains, while mutual aid offers political strategy for systemic change. Rather than abandoning EA's concern for effectiveness, Mouser argues effective altruists should incorporate mutual aid frameworks as part of long-term strategy for maximum impact.

  RELEVANCE: Mouser's synthesis suggests EA's practical focus on individual giving (including income-based pledges) represents a strategic choice rather than necessary commitment. If mutual aid approaches could prove more effective at addressing root causes, EA's own principles would recommend incorporating them. This supports viewing EA as theoretically flexible about implementation methods, which could extend to flexibility about whether income or wealth provides the better basis for giving norms.

  POSITION: Synthetic approach arguing mutual aid and EA are compatible; EA should incorporate mutual aid for greater long-term effectiveness.

This domain addresses the normative foundations of wealth accumulation, retention, and transfer. Three central debates structure this literature: (1) the tension between property rights and obligations of beneficence, particularly whether absolute property rights can be reconciled with duties to aid those in need; (2) the moral status of inheritance and intergenerational wealth transfer, including questions about whether unearned advantage violates principles of equal opportunity or desert; and (3) emerging debates about limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings. Recent work has moved beyond traditional libertarian vs. egalitarian framings to explore how wealth concentration affects democratic equality (Halliday 2018, Robeyns 2019), how taxation relates to distributive justice (Murphy & Nagel 2002, Pedersen 2020), and whether property rights themselves presuppose duties of charity (Udi 2015). The domain reveals a systematic asymmetry: while income taxation is extensively theorized, asset-based obligations receive comparatively less attention, despite assets constituting the primary locus of wealth inequality.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question by examining the moral status of holding assets versus earning income. The literature on property rights and beneficence explores whether asset holdings generate obligations distinct from income-based duties. Halliday's work on inheritance demonstrates how assets perpetuate inequality across generations in ways income does not. The limitarianism literature provides philosophical grounding for threshold-based approaches to wealth limits, relevant to determining whether asset-based norms might capture utilitarian obligations more effectively than income-based pledges. Murphy & Nagel's challenge to pre-tax property rights reframes the entire debate about what wealth individuals are entitled to retain before obligations to others arise.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature largely treats assets and income as fungible from a moral perspective, rarely examining whether their different marginal utilities warrant different normative treatment. Most work focuses on justifying redistribution of existing wealth rather than on comparing income-based vs. asset-based frameworks for determining charitable obligations. The intersection of marginal utility theory and wealth ethics remains underexplored, particularly regarding how diminishing returns on asset accumulation might justify asset-specific obligations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay particular attention to how property rights theories accommodate duties of beneficence (Udi 2015, Locke scholarship). Consider whether the limitarianism literature's focus on upper bounds complements or conflicts with the research project's focus on marginal utility. Examine how inheritance taxation arguments (Halliday, White, Pedersen) might inform broader asset-based obligation frameworks. The Murphy & Nagel framework may provide conceptual tools for rethinking pre-obligation entitlements.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Libertarian Property Rights: 3 papers - Absolute property rights with minimal taxation
- Liberal Egalitarian Redistribution: 6 papers - Taxation justified by distributive justice principles
- Limitarianism: 4 papers - Upper limits on permissible wealth holdings
- Asset-Specific Justice: 5 papers - Inheritance and wealth transfer as distinct moral problems

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0195150163.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the idea that individuals have pre-tax property rights, arguing instead that property rights are constituted by the legal system including tax law, hence taxation cannot violate natural property rights. The book develops a political theory of taxation grounded in considerations of fairness and the collective nature of economic productivity, arguing that what one "deserves" or is "entitled to" can only be determined after specifying a legitimate tax system.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamentally reframes the research question by denying that there are pre-obligation property rights in either income or assets. If Murphy and Nagel are correct, the distinction between income-based and asset-based charitable obligations may need to be grounded in their respective effects on utility or fairness rather than in prior entitlements. Their framework suggests examining which taxation/obligation base (income vs. assets) better achieves distributive justice goals, which aligns with the project's utilitarian approach.

  POSITION: Represents a liberal egalitarian rejection of libertarian property rights theory, with major implications for how we think about baseline entitlements before charitable obligations arise.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198803355.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that unrestricted inheritance is unjust because it perpetuates intergenerational inequality by concentrating opportunities within specific family lineages and social groups, creating "economic segregation." Halliday defends inheritance taxation not primarily to fund redistribution but to prevent the replication of class hierarchy across generations. The work synthesizes luck egalitarian concerns about unearned advantage with social egalitarian worries about group-based stratification.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses asset-specific moral considerations by demonstrating how wealth (particularly inherited wealth) creates obligations and injustices distinct from those arising from income. The focus on intergenerational wealth transfer highlights how assets function differently from income in perpetuating inequality—assets compound across generations while income typically does not. This supports examining whether asset-based charitable norms might better capture certain utilitarian obligations than income-based ones, particularly regarding long-term inequality prevention.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian position combining luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism, with specific focus on assets as distinct moral category requiring special treatment beyond general income taxation.

  pages = {251--266},
  doi = {10.1080/19452829.2019.1633734},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces "limitarianism"—the view that there are upper limits to how much wealth individuals should permissibly hold. Robeyns provides two main arguments: (1) extreme wealth undermines political equality by granting the superrich disproportionate political influence, and (2) surplus wealth above the threshold needed for flourishing should be redirected to address urgent unmet needs and collective action problems like climate change. The threshold is set where additional wealth no longer contributes to the holder's flourishing.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the research project's focus on marginal utility of assets. Robeyns's threshold corresponds closely to the "security threshold" beyond which marginal utility of assets is low. Her framework provides philosophical grounding for asset-specific upper limits based on diminishing marginal returns to flourishing. However, the project examines a different question: not whether wealth above a threshold should be redistributed, but whether obligations to give should be calculated based on assets rather than income given their different marginal utility profiles.

  POSITION: Establishes limitarianism as a distinct position in distributive justice focused specifically on upper bounds of permissible wealth, challenging the unlimited wealth accumulation permitted by both libertarian and many liberal egalitarian theories.

  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9780429316753},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides comprehensive philosophical analysis of taxation as instrument of distributive justice, examining income tax, wealth tax, and inheritance tax from multiple theoretical perspectives (Rawlsian, libertarian, utilitarian, luck egalitarian). Argues that inheritance tax is particularly justified because it addresses inequalities arising from unchosen circumstances (family background) while avoiding disincentive effects on labor. Defends progressive taxation including wealth taxation on grounds that it better tracks ability to pay than income taxation alone.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages the comparison between income-based and wealth-based approaches to distributive obligations. Pedersen's analysis of wealth taxation versus income taxation provides theoretical framework for comparing these different obligation bases. His argument that wealth taxes avoid labor disincentives while targeting unchosen inequalities suggests potential advantages of asset-based obligations over income-based ones, though he focuses on taxation rather than voluntary giving. The book's examination of ability-to-pay principles across different tax bases is particularly relevant.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian approach synthesizing multiple theories to justify progressive taxation of income, wealth, and inheritance, with emphasis on wealth and inheritance as particularly just targets due to their connection to unchosen circumstances.

  doi = {10.1017/S0034670515000030},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reinterprets Locke's theory to show that property rights and duties of charity are not contradictory but both derive from the fundamental right to preservation. Argues that Lockean charity grounds coercively enforceable distributive obligations without infringing property rights, because both property rights and charity rights stem from God's grant that each person has right to means of preservation. This theological commitment means property rights are not absolute but constrained by others' preservation needs from the outset.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the central tension in the research project between property rights (to retained assets/income) and obligations of beneficence (to give to those in need). Udi's reconciliation suggests that even within strong property rights frameworks, asset holdings may be subject to preservation-based obligations. This supports exploring whether these obligations should track assets (which provide security/preservation) differently than income. The Lockean framework also connects to contemporary debates about sufficiency thresholds and basic needs.

  POSITION: Reconciliationist position showing that robust property rights and significant charitable obligations can coexist when both are grounded in fundamental rights to preservation, challenging both pure libertarian and pure redistributive views.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780199609222.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematically addresses and refutes four common moral objections to inheritance taxation: (1) double taxation concern, (2) differential treatment based on wealth use, (3) penalizing virtuous behavior, and (4) targeting holdings rather than consumption. White argues these objections fail to undermine the justice case for inheritance tax, which rests on preventing accumulation of unearned advantage and promoting equal opportunity. Distinguishes between equity in treatment (treating similar cases similarly) and equity as fairness in distribution.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical defense of treating assets (particularly inherited wealth) differently from earned income for tax purposes, which parallels the research project's investigation of whether assets warrant different treatment for charitable obligations. White's refutation of the "double taxation" objection is particularly relevant, as similar arguments might be raised against asset-based charitable norms (claiming assets are already "after-tax" income). His analysis clarifies how differential treatment can be justified on fairness grounds.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian defense of inheritance taxation specifically, arguing that wealth transfers create distinct justice concerns that warrant distinct policy responses beyond general income taxation.

  pages = {845--863},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-024-09662-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the conceptual structure of limitarianism, distinguishing two interpretations of "excess resources" above the riches line: (1) resources have zero moral value for the holder, vs. (2) resources have value but other normative concerns outweigh the holder's claim. Argues limitarians should focus on either the number of people with excess resources or total amount of excess (or both) depending on which values the theory prioritizes, and that both redistributive and predistributive measures may be appropriate.

  RELEVANCE: Refines the theoretical framework for thinking about upper wealth limits based on marginal utility considerations. Timmer's distinction between zero-value and outweighed-value interpretations maps onto the research question about marginal utility of assets: beyond the security threshold, do assets have low marginal utility (not zero) that gets outweighed by others' needs? His analysis of what metrics matter (number above threshold vs. total excess) could inform how asset-based obligation norms should be structured.

  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1111/ejop.12535},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys proto-limitarian arguments throughout history of philosophy, finding that many canonical philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Mill) made claims that wealth should be limited. Identifies four moral domains for limitarian arguments: moral psychology (wealth corrupts character), moral reasoning (wealth distorts judgment), virtue ethics (excessive wealth incompatible with virtue), and political morality (wealth undermines political equality). Shows that intrinsic arguments for wealth limitation (beyond instrumental effects) are common historically.

  RELEVANCE: Provides historical philosophical grounding for the intuition that excessive wealth is problematic independent of its effects—relevant if the research project uncovers that assets warrant different treatment due to their inherent characteristics rather than just their consequences. The historical survey reveals persistent philosophical concern with wealth limits that predates modern inequality data, suggesting deep normative worries about asset concentration. The distinction between intrinsic and instrumental arguments may help clarify whether asset-based obligations are justified by asset characteristics or their effects.

  POSITION: Historical analysis supporting contemporary limitarianism by showing its deep roots in Western philosophical tradition across multiple schools of thought.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198798439.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines wealth transfer taxation from multiple philosophical perspectives (utilitarianism, Rawlsian justice, libertarianism, capabilities approach), arguing that most major political philosophies support some form of wealth transfer taxation. The chapter demonstrates that wealth transfer taxes serve expressive function of affirming society's distributive justice commitments beyond revenue generation. Argues wealth transfer taxation achieves goals of reducing unequal opportunity more effectively than alternatives.

  RELEVANCE: Provides multi-theoretical framework for evaluating asset-specific taxation that could be adapted to voluntary asset-based giving norms. The finding that diverse philosophical traditions converge on supporting wealth transfer taxation (despite disagreeing on income taxation) suggests something distinctive about the moral status of asset transfers. This convergence may indicate that assets warrant different normative treatment than income across multiple ethical frameworks, not just utilitarian ones.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach showing that wealth transfer taxation can be justified from multiple philosophical perspectives, suggesting robust philosophical consensus on treating wealth transfers distinctly.

  doi = {10.3326/pse.44.4.2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents empirical and normative analysis showing that inheritance fundamentally violates meritocratic justice principles but faces low political support due to family values. Uses survey data to demonstrate inconsistencies in people's views: they simultaneously endorse equal opportunity and accept inheritance despite inheritance being primary mechanism of unequal opportunity. Argues family values trump distributive justice concerns in public opinion, creating barrier to inheritance taxation despite its justice rationale.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights the political psychology challenge for any proposal (including asset-based giving norms) that asks individuals to limit asset transfers to family members. The finding that family values dominate distributive justice concerns suggests that voluntary asset-based giving norms might face resistance even if philosophically justified. However, the paper focuses on bequests rather than lifetime asset holdings, so the psychological barriers may differ for charitable giving from existing assets versus limiting inheritance.

  POSITION: Empirically-informed normative analysis showing gap between justice principles (which support inheritance taxation) and public attitudes (which resist it due to family values).

  doi = {10.1111/josp.12096},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides novel interpretation of Marx's Abilities/Needs Principle as capturing important ideas about solidarity, fair reciprocity, and self-realization in work that contemporary liberal egalitarianism overlooks. Argues the principle requires sensitivity to individual differences in abilities and needs, duties to contribute according to capacity, and distribution according to needs rather than market value. Emphasizes work as site of self-realization, not just means to consumption, and solidarity as intrinsically valuable beyond instrumental reciprocity.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about wealth ethics, Gilabert's analysis of needs-based distribution principles provides alternative framework to wealth-based or income-based approaches. The emphasis on individual differences in "abilities" and "needs" could inform how asset-based vs. income-based obligations should account for varying circumstances—perhaps those with greater asset-holding ability have stronger obligations. The principle's focus on fair reciprocity and avoiding free-riding may parallel concerns about asset holders benefiting from societal stability without proportional contribution.

  title = {The expressive injustice of being rich},
  journal = {Analysis},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1093/analys/anaa012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that extreme wealth is expressively unjust—it conveys the message that the rich person's interests matter vastly more than others' interests, violating interpersonal justification requirements. Beyond consequences for inequality or poverty, being extremely rich is itself a "preposterous" claim from the standpoint of interpersonal morality, because it asserts entitlement to vastly more resources than needed for flourishing while others lack basic necessities. The injustice is in the expressive content, not just distributive effects.

  RELEVANCE: Provides distinctive argument for asset limits based on expressive meaning rather than consequences or rights violations. This could complement utilitarian arguments for asset-based obligations: even if marginal utility diminishes gradually, at some point asset retention becomes expressively unjust. The focus on what wealth "says" about one's view of others' moral status adds dimension to the research question beyond marginal utility calculations. Suggests that very high asset thresholds might be unjustifiable even if marginal utility has not reached zero.

  POSITION: Develops expressivist argument for upper wealth limits that is independent of consequentialist and deontological considerations, emphasizing the meaning and justifiability of resource claims to others.

  doi = {10.1007/s11406-018-0030-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends limitarian policies as means to political equality against two objections: (1) that limitarianism inefficiently burdens the rich to achieve political equality (could use alternative means), and (2) that limiting wealth is insufficient to guarantee political equality (need additional measures). Argues limitarian policies avoid productivity losses by focusing on wealth above flourishing threshold, and that while not sufficient for political equality, they are valuable partial step that should complement other strategies.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses implementation challenges for any asset-based obligation system, including voluntary giving norms. Timmer's response to the efficiency objection—that targeting wealth above the flourishing threshold minimizes productivity costs—parallels the research project's focus on assets beyond security thresholds where marginal utility is low. The acknowledgment that asset limits alone are insufficient suggests any asset-based charitable norms would need integration with other mechanisms, not replacement of income-based approaches.

  POSITION: Defends democratic/political equality rationale for limitarianism while acknowledging need for complementary policies, positioning limitarianism as partial but important component of egalitarian distributive justice.

  doi = {10.1017/S0034670517000602},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Tocqueville's approach to social question of poverty and inequality through lens of rights rather than charity. Argues Tocqueville distinguished between legal rights (enforceable) and duties of charity (moral but unenforceable), opposing public relief as rights-based but supporting private charity. Tocqueville worried that framing aid as legal right would undermine individual moral responsibility and create dependency, preferring voluntary charitable relationships that maintain human dignity and reciprocal moral development.

  RELEVANCE: Tocqueville's framework highlights the choice between mandatory redistribution (through taxation) and voluntary giving (through charity) that underlies debates about whether asset-based obligations should be enforceable or voluntary. His concern that legal rights to aid undermine moral relationships may inform whether the research project should focus on voluntary norms or policy proposals. The emphasis on charity preserving moral relationships between giver and recipient could bear on whether asset-based giving norms should remain within voluntary sphere rather than becoming tax obligations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews empirical literature on wealth inequality dynamics globally, showing dramatic increase in wealth concentration since 1980s: top 1% wealth share increased from 28% to 33% for China, Europe, and US combined. Documents methodological challenges in measuring wealth at the top due to financial globalization, tax havens, and offshore assets. Argues traditional survey and tax data underestimate true wealth inequality, as evidenced by leaks from financial institutions and tax amnesty data revealing hidden wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical foundation for philosophical debates about wealth ethics by documenting the scale and concentration of global wealth. The finding that wealth inequality has increased dramatically supports urgency of examining asset-based obligations. The methodological challenges in measuring top wealth holdings are relevant for implementing any asset-based giving norms—if wealth can be easily hidden or moved offshore, voluntary norms or policies targeting assets face enforcement challenges that income-based approaches may avoid. The empirical reality of extreme wealth concentration grounds normative questions about its justification.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary empirical context for ethical debates about wealth concentration and connects wealth inequality to gender justice issues. The proposal for wealth taxation alongside income taxation suggests policy-makers increasingly view assets as appropriate target for progressive redistribution, supporting philosophical examination of asset-based obligations. The gender dimension highlights how wealth ethics intersects with other justice concerns—relevant if asset holdings have gendered patterns distinct from income.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically examines the democratic argument for limitarianism, which holds that wealth limits are needed to prevent political inequality. Questions whether limitarian policies would effectively protect democracy, arguing that moderately wealthy individuals can still exercise problematic political influence, and that non-wealthy entities (corporations, foreign governments) also threaten political equality. Proposes focusing on political system resilience rather than wealth limits per se.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges one major justification for treating assets distinctly (their threat to political equality), raising questions about whether asset-based obligations are best justified on democratic grounds or other bases like marginal utility. If Volacu is correct that wealth limits alone cannot secure political equality, this strengthens arguments for justifying asset-based norms on utilitarian grounds (diminishing marginal utility) rather than political equality grounds. Suggests any asset-based framework should be clear about which values it aims to serve.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues from libertarian perspective that charity belongs squarely in private sector due to its reliance on voluntary contributions and private property rights, contrasting with public sector's dependence on compulsory taxation. While charities serve public needs, they do so without coercive mechanism characteristic of state, making them compatible with free-market values. Rejects categorization of charity as sui generis "third sector," asserting stronger affinity with private sector.

  RELEVANCE: Represents libertarian perspective on asset use and charitable giving that contrasts sharply with redistributive approaches. Block's framework treats all charitable giving as supererogatory (beyond duty) rather than obligatory, challenging the project's premise that there are utilitarian obligations to give. However, the emphasis on voluntary nature of charity highlights important question: should asset-based obligations be conceived as moral duties or as social norms for voluntary behavior? The libertarian position provides counter-perspective against which to test asset-based obligation arguments.

  POSITION: Libertarian view treating charity as entirely voluntary private-sector activity without obligatory character, resisting both enforceable obligations and strong moral requirements to give.

DOMAIN: Decision Theory and Giving Under Uncertainty

SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, WebSearch
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how decision-theoretic frameworks, particularly expected
utility theory, apply to the timing and form of charitable giving. The central
debate concerns whether philanthropists should "give now" or "give later" by
investing resources for future deployment. Phil Trammell's work on "patient
philanthropy" has been foundational, demonstrating that under standard economic
assumptions, philanthropists with low pure time preference should invest most
resources for decades or centuries before disbursing them. This work challenges
conventional philanthropic practice and raises questions about appropriate
discount rates for altruistic decision-making.

The domain also encompasses effective altruism's approach to cause
prioritization, which applies expected value calculations to compare
philanthropic opportunities across different causes, geographies, and time
horizons. Key considerations include: (1) the appropriate discount rate for
philanthropic decision-making, particularly whether to include pure time
preference; (2) uncertainty about future opportunities and existential risks;
(3) the tension between immediate suffering and potentially larger long-term
impact; and (4) practical constraints such as legal disbursement requirements
and organizational sustainability.

Recent developments include the establishment of the Patient Philanthropy Fund
and growing attention to "longtermism"—the view that positively influencing the
far future is a key moral priority. However, critics argue that patient
philanthropy may be legally constrained, ignores urgent present needs, and
relies on questionable assumptions about persistent investment returns and
institutional stability.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research project's central question about
optimal giving norms by examining the temporal dimension: should giving be
triggered by income flows or asset accumulation, and at what rate? The
decision-theoretic framework provides tools for comparing income-based versus
asset-based giving norms under uncertainty about future opportunities, returns,
and needs. Trammell's work on heterogeneous time preferences is particularly
relevant for understanding how different philanthropists might optimally
coordinate their giving timing.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While patient philanthropy literature addresses when to give, it focuses less on
the income versus assets distinction central to this project. There is limited
analysis of how asset-based versus income-based triggers interact with optimal
timing considerations. Additionally, the literature focuses primarily on
ultra-wealthy philanthropists and foundations rather than middle-class donors
subject to the asymmetries this project investigates.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Connect this domain to Domain 2 (Consequentialism & Demandingness) by examining
how temporal considerations affect demandingness: does patient philanthropy make
utilitarian demands more or less onerous? Link to Domain 4 (Asset vs. Income
Taxation) by exploring whether the case for patient philanthropy strengthens
arguments for taxing assets rather than income. Consider how uncertainty about
optimal timing might justify simpler heuristics like the 10% income pledge.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Patient philanthropy (4 papers): Advocates investing resources for extended
  periods before disbursement to maximize long-term impact
- Give now (2 papers): Argues for immediate deployment due to urgent needs,
  institutional risks, and discounting considerations
- Cause prioritization (2 papers): Applies expected value reasoning to compare
  philanthropic opportunities across domains
- Methodological critiques (2 papers): Questions the applicability of expected
  utility theory to philanthropic decisions under deep uncertainty

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes optimal philanthropic spending timing when funders
  have heterogeneous discount rates. Proves that allowing for time preference
  heterogeneity (rather than assuming a common discount rate) produces
  substantially different equilibrium funding behavior: patient funders invest
  the entirety of their resources for substantial periods rather than spending
  immediately. Demonstrates that patient funders' equilibrium payoff can grow
  arbitrarily large as their share of initial funding approaches zero, and
  discusses implications for legal disbursement minima.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the project's temporal dimension of giving
  norms. Shows that heterogeneous time preferences among donors lead to
  coordination dynamics where more patient donors should invest while impatient
  donors spend. This suggests that optimal giving norms may differ across
  individuals based on their time preferences, complicating simple universal
  rules like "give 10% of income." The asset accumulation through patient
  investment could justify asset-based rather than income-based giving
  triggers.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines what discount rate patient philanthropists should use
  when evaluating the timing of charitable expenditures. Argues that
  philanthropists who care equally about helping people now versus future
  generations should remove the pure time preference component (delta) from the
  standard Ramsey discounting formula. Under this framework, with historical
  investment returns around 4-7% and a philanthropic discount rate of only 0.5-
  2%, patient philanthropists could justify saving resources for decades or
  centuries before deploying them.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the implicit assumption in income-based giving norms
  (like tithing 10% of annual income) that resources should be deployed
  contemporaneously with when they're earned. If Trammell is correct, donors
  might better fulfill utilitarian obligations by accumulating assets through
  investment rather than giving from current income. This directly engages the
  project's question about whether asset-based norms better track utilitarian
  obligations than income-based norms.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "strong longtermism"—the thesis that the most
  important feature of our actions today is their impact on the far future.
  Argues that some actions aimed at reducing existential risks deliver
  significantly larger expected benefits in the far future than any available
  near-term action. Discusses the option of investing resources in sovereign
  wealth funds with longtermist missions rather than spending on immediate
  causes, noting that compound investment returns could compensate for risks of
  future misalignment.

  RELEVANCE: Extends the patient philanthropy framework to argue that reducing
  existential risk and influencing the far future may dominate near-term
  charitable opportunities. This challenges both income-based and asset-based
  giving norms that focus on addressing current poverty or suffering. If
  longtermism is correct, optimal giving norms might involve accumulating
  resources to deploy on civilizational trajectory changes rather than
  responding to immediate needs—a consideration absent from traditional
  utilitarian giving frameworks.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruist cause prioritization rankings
  face a fundamental problem: the overwhelming importance and inscrutability of
  actions' indirect long-run effects ("cluelessness") combined with permissive
  decision principles for deep uncertainty (the "maximality rule") undermine
  confidence in orthodox EA conclusions. Demonstrates tension between
  longtermist perspectives, honest acknowledgment of deep uncertainty, and
  conventional EA cause rankings.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the decision-theoretic foundations underlying both
  patient philanthropy arguments and cause prioritization frameworks that might
  inform giving norms. If we are "clueless" about long-run effects, the case
  for sophisticated asset-based giving strategies informed by expected value
  calculations weakens, potentially favoring simpler heuristics like income-

  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruism's criticisms of "less
  effective" charities are inconsistent with EA's professed ecumenicity toward
  different moral views and evidentiary methods. Demonstrates that individuals
  may justifiably support charities other than those maximizing expected value
  if they hold different moral views, value personal connection, or have
  different risk attitudes. Effective altruists must either abandon ecumenicity
  or revise their critiques of non-optimal charities.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the universalist implications of expected value-based
  giving frameworks that might support either patient philanthropy or specific
  asset/income-based norms. If different moral views and personal connections
  justify diverse giving patterns, this supports pluralism about giving norms

  charity, perhaps neither income-based nor asset-based charitable giving norms

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how missing market participants (constrained
  borrowers, future generations) affect the social discount rate. When market
  participants are missing, the population's average discount rate may differ

  intrapersonal discounting asymmetries (future selves discount the past, but
  not vice versa) may justify low social discount rates.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical grounding for debates about appropriate
  discount rates in philanthropic decision-making. The analysis of borrowing
  constraints and missing participants connects to the project's focus on how

  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews principles of financial economics for choosing
  discount rates in public and private decision-making. Critiques government
  practices of using borrowing rates as cost of capital, arguing for risk-

  criteria.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes limitations of standard discounting frameworks for
  long-horizon philanthropic decisions, relevant to patient philanthropy
  debates. The distinction between short-horizon decisions (where standard
  methods apply) and very long horizons (where they fail) suggests that income-
  based giving norms oriented to near-term impact might be more tractable than

DOMAIN: Empirical Research on Giving Behavior
SEARCH_DATE: 2026-01-04
PAPERS_FOUND: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
SEARCH_SOURCES: SEP, PhilPapers, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers psychological and economic research on how people actually
give to charity, including the motivational factors, behavioral patterns, and
contextual influences on charitable donations. The literature reveals several
key findings: (1) Giving is motivated by a complex mix of pure altruism, warm-glow
(intrinsic satisfaction from giving), and social signaling; (2) Income and wealth
have distinct effects on giving, with evidence that windfall income is donated
at higher rates than earned income; (3) Social norms significantly influence
giving behavior, with both descriptive and injunctive norms playing roles;
(4) Pledges and commitments show mixed effectiveness - while high-profile
initiatives like the Giving Pledge have inspired billionaire philanthropy,
actual follow-through rates are modest; (5) The relationship between giving
intention and actual giving behavior is weaker than often assumed, with effect
sizes for behavioral outcomes being 3-8 times smaller than for stated intentions.

Recent experimental work has refined our understanding of warm glow versus
pure altruism through novel elicitation methods, showing that most donors
exhibit "impure altruism" - caring about both recipient welfare and their
own satisfaction from giving. Field experiments demonstrate that framing effects,
matching incentives, and social context significantly influence donation amounts
and frequency. Cross-cultural research reveals that giving patterns vary
substantially based on cultural tightness-looseness, religious context, and
prevailing social norms about appropriate donation targets.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This empirical literature directly addresses the research question about income
versus wealth-based giving norms. Studies on windfall income effects, warm glow,
and the marginal utility of different income sources provide behavioral evidence
for how donors actually respond to changes in income and wealth. The finding
that bonus/windfall income generates higher donation rates than earned income
supports the theoretical asymmetry proposed in the research idea. Additionally,
research on pledges and commitments is directly relevant to evaluating the
10% income pledge versus asset-based approaches.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few studies directly compare giving behavior from income versus accumulated
wealth/assets. Most empirical work focuses on income effects or wealth effects
separately, without systematic comparison. Limited research on how donors
conceptualize the marginal utility of income versus assets in their giving
decisions. Need for longitudinal studies tracking how giving responds to
wealth accumulation beyond security thresholds.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this literature, emphasize the behavioral evidence for
differential treatment of income versus windfall/wealth. Connect warm glow
findings to questions about intrinsic versus instrumental motivations for
meeting giving norms. Use pledge effectiveness research to evaluate claims
about income-based commitments like the 10% pledge. Consider how social
norm research illuminates the feasibility of shifting from income-based to
asset-based giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Warm glow / impure altruism: 6 papers - Giving motivated by intrinsic satisfaction alongside altruistic concern
- Social norms influence: 5 papers - Both descriptive and injunctive norms shape donation behavior
- Income/wealth effects: 4 papers - Differential responses to earned income, windfall income, and wealth
- Pledge effectiveness: 3 papers - Mixed evidence on commitment mechanisms for sustained giving

  pages = {464--477},
  doi = {10.2307/2234133},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andreoni introduces the concept of "warm glow" to explain charitable giving, arguing that donors derive utility both from the public good their donation provides (pure altruism) and from the act of giving itself (impure altruism). This model predicts incomplete crowding out of private donations by government provision, which pure altruism models cannot explain. The warm-glow component represents the personal satisfaction, moral fulfillment, or positive self-image donors receive from their contribution, independent of the donation's impact.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper is essential for understanding the motivational complexity behind charitable giving. For the research project's comparison of income versus asset-based norms, warm glow suggests that donors may respond differently to giving requirements based on whether they perceive the obligation as intrinsically satisfying or externally imposed. The distinction between pure and impure altruism helps explain why income-based norms (regular, visible giving) might generate more warm glow than asset-based norms (less frequent, less visible transfers).

  pages = {431--447},
  doi = {10.1002/per.2256},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This study applies Moral Foundations Theory to charitable giving, finding that stronger individualizing moral intuitions (fairness and harm prevention) predict greater willingness to donate and larger donation amounts, while binding intuitions (loyalty, authority, sanctity) predict allocation toward in-group causes. Importantly, moral foundations predicted giving beyond political ideology, religiosity, and demographics, suggesting they tap into distinct psychological drivers of prosocial behavior.

  RELEVANCE: This research illuminates how different moral frameworks shape giving patterns, which is directly relevant to understanding who might be responsive to income-based versus asset-based giving norms. If individualizing foundations predict concern for distant others, these individuals might be more receptive to consequentialist arguments about effective giving from accumulated assets. The finding that moral foundations operate independently of demographics suggests that norm-setting for charitable obligations should consider psychological heterogeneity, not just economic capacity.

  POSITION: Integrates moral psychology with behavioral philanthropy research, showing that deep-seated moral intuitions shape giving patterns in ways that cross-cut standard demographic and ideological categories.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzing the first decade of the Giving Pledge (created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett), this study finds that while the pledge has attracted 211 billionaire signatories, its impact remains difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and modest commitment goal (giving away at least half of wealth during lifetime or at death). The pledge letters reveal education and health as dominant causes, with giving motivated by desires to make a difference, give back, personal fulfillment, and early socialization into philanthropy. The population is dominated by white, male, US-based billionaires, with tech billionaires forming a wealthier and younger subgroup.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical analysis of the Giving Pledge is directly relevant to evaluating income-based versus wealth-based giving norms. The pledge represents a high-profile wealth-based (rather than income-based) commitment, yet its lack of binding enforcement and vague timeline illustrate key challenges with asset-based norms. The finding that actual follow-through is difficult to assess suggests that wealth-based pledges may lack the regularity and accountability that characterize income-based norms like the 10% pledge. The demographic concentration also raises questions about the universalizability of asset-based giving norms.

  doi = {10.1177/0899764019843340},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using data from over 17,000 donors across five charities, this study demonstrates that the relationships between satisfaction, trust, commitment and charitable giving are 3-8 times larger when modeling giving intentions than when modeling actual giving behavior. Critically, 27% of donors who stated no intention to give actually donated, revealing a substantial gap between expressed attitudes and behavior. At the individual level, all group-level relationships between psychological factors and intentions replicate for behavior, but with dramatically smaller effect sizes.

  RELEVANCE: This finding has profound implications for evaluating giving norms and pledges. Much research on charitable giving relies on stated intentions rather than actual behavior, potentially overstating the effectiveness of norm-based interventions. For the income versus asset debate, this suggests we should be skeptical of survey evidence about willingness to adopt different giving norms, and instead focus on behavioral studies. The large intention-behavior gap also suggests that binding commitments (as in income-based norms with regular, visible giving) may be more effective than aspirational pledges (as in many wealth-based commitments).

  pages = {104080},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.104080},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Through two experiments, this study shows that bonus/windfall income generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income of equal amount, and that this pattern can be explained by social norms. A coordination game reveals that people believe morally appropriate donation levels depend on both the amount received and whether it was earned or windfall. The norms elicited in the coordination game match actual donation patterns across demographics, providing strong evidence that social norms drive differential treatment of income sources.

  RELEVANCE: This finding is central to the research project's thesis about asymmetric marginal utility of income versus assets. If windfall income (which resembles drawing down assets) generates higher donation rates than earned income, this provides behavioral evidence that donors implicitly recognize that different income sources have different marginal utility. This supports the argument that giving norms should account for the source of funds - regular income serves ongoing needs (high marginal utility) while accumulated assets beyond security thresholds serve lower-utility purposes (insurance, optionality, status), making asset-based giving more appropriate.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence showing that income source matters for giving behavior in ways consistent with differential marginal utility, mediated by social norms about appropriate donation levels.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This multilevel meta-analysis of 113 independent samples (N=100,469 across 22 countries) finds a moderate positive relationship between social norms and charitable giving (r=.18). The effect is stronger for injunctive norms (what one ought to do) than descriptive norms (what most people do), when the referent is friends/family versus anonymous others, for internalized versus externally presented norms, and when giving is observed by others. Effects were particularly strong for younger people and in non-WEIRD and collectivist contexts, but were only found in published (not preregistered) studies, suggesting publication bias.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive meta-analysis establishes that social norms significantly influence charitable giving, which is crucial for evaluating the feasibility of shifting from income-based to asset-based giving norms. The finding that injunctive norms (oughtness) outperform descriptive norms suggests that moral arguments about what donors should give (whether from income or assets) matter more than what others actually give. The stronger effects for close social referents implies that norm change might require grassroots movement rather than top-down policy. The publication bias finding counsels caution about overstating norm effects.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Three experiments (N=2,203) and a field study with alumni donations (N=22,468) show that making incentives for charitable giving more salient increases prosocial behavior when prosocial motivation is low, but has no effect (or negative effect) when prosocial motivation is high. The mechanism is that salient incentives increase consideration of self-interested benefits, which drives behavior for those low in prosocial motivation but can undermine intrinsic motivation for those high in prosocial motivation. This demonstrates heterogeneous treatment effects based on underlying motivation.

  RELEVANCE: This research has important implications for designing giving norms and incentives. If the goal is to encourage giving from those not already motivated by altruism, highlighting personal benefits (tax deductions, social recognition, warm glow) may be effective. However, for highly prosocial individuals, emphasizing such incentives could backfire by crowding out intrinsic motivation. This suggests that income-based versus asset-based norms might appeal to different donor populations - income norms may work better for habit formation among the already-motivated, while asset-based norms with clear incentives might activate the less-motivated.

  POSITION: Controlled experiments revealing that the effectiveness of incentive framing depends critically on donors' underlying prosocial motivation, suggesting one-size-fits-all approaches to promoting giving may be suboptimal.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study introduces two interventions to increase effective charitable giving: (1) donation bundling - allowing donors to split donations between their preferred charity and an expert-recommended highly effective charity, which increased effective donations by 76%; (2) micromatching - offering increasing match rates for allocating more to the effective charity, which provided an additional 55% boost. These techniques were implemented in GivingMultiplier.org, which fundraised over $1.5 million in 14 months. The research shifts focus from quantity of giving to effectiveness of giving.

  RELEVANCE: This research demonstrates that donors can be nudged toward more effective giving without completely abandoning their personal preferences, which is relevant for promoting asset-based giving norms. If donors are attached to regular income-based giving (which may serve personal/emotional needs), bundling approaches could encourage additional asset-based giving to effective causes. The success of micromatching also suggests that graduated incentives (e.g., recognition tiers for asset-based giving) could increase uptake. The platform's success shows that relatively modest interventions can substantially impact giving patterns.

  POSITION: Applied behavioral research showing that carefully designed choice architecture can substantially increase effective charitable giving while respecting donor autonomy and personal preferences.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Across six experiments, "working-together" normative appeals that invited people to "join in" and "do it together" significantly increased charitable giving and other prosocial behaviors, while normative-information appeals (same information, no collaboration framing) had no effect. Mediation analyses show working-together appeals foster a feeling of collective action that increases motivation while reducing perceived social pressure. Effects held for actual charitable donations, not just intentions, and generalized across public goods (carbon reduction, paper towel use).

  RELEVANCE: This finding suggests that the framing of giving norms matters as much as their content. If asset-based giving norms are framed as a collective movement toward a common goal (e.g., "Join the effective giving community in dedicating 1% of assets annually"), they may be more effective than purely individualistic framing. The reduction in social pressure when collaboration is emphasized could address concerns that giving norms are coercive. This also suggests that grassroots movements for asset-based giving could be more successful than top-down mandates.

  POSITION: Social psychological research showing that normative appeals are most effective when they frame prosocial behavior as collective action rather than individual compliance with social expectations.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper introduces a novel method for eliciting the strength of altruistic motivation (ranging from pure warm glow to pure altruism) by combining a giving-type elicitation task with a Cobb-Douglas impure altruism utility function. This allows researchers to uniquely identify where donors fall on the altruism spectrum, which is critical because "impure altruists" (caring about both recipient welfare and personal satisfaction) form the largest donor category but are hardest to characterize. The method is compared with an alternative survey-based approach.

  RELEVANCE: Understanding the distribution of altruistic types in the donor population is crucial for designing effective giving norms. If most donors are impure altruists (as suggested), then both income-based and asset-based norms need to account for both the instrumental impact of donations and the expressive/identity benefits to donors. Pure asset-based norms focused solely on effective impact might fail to generate warm glow, while pure income-based norms focused on regular habit formation might not maximize impact. This research provides tools to measure which considerations matter most to different donor segments.

  POSITION: Methodological innovation enabling fine-grained measurement of altruistic motivation types, essential for matching giving interventions to donor psychology.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This theoretical paper extends models of charitable giving to incorporate income heterogeneity and distrust in institutions. It compares four models: public goods philanthropy (caring about total provision), warm-glow philanthropy (caring about act of giving), impact philanthropy (caring about personal contribution), and socially-motivated philanthropy (considering both trust and ability-to-pay). The socially-motivated model uniquely predicts a U-shaped pattern of giving (low-income and high-income give more than middle-income), which is frequently observed empirically but not explained by standard models.

  RELEVANCE: This theoretical framework helps explain heterogeneous giving patterns that are relevant to evaluating income versus asset-based norms. The U-shaped pattern suggests that middle-income individuals (for whom ability-to-pay is moderate and trust concerns are highest) may be least responsive to giving norms of any kind. The socially-motivated model's incorporation of ability-to-pay directly addresses the research project's concern with matching giving obligations to capacity. The trust dimension also suggests that asset-based norms may face additional resistance if donors distrust institutional measurement of wealth.

  POSITION: Theoretical extension of charitable giving models to incorporate realistic heterogeneity in income and trust, providing foundation for understanding who responds to different types of giving norms.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Four experiments (N=2,203) tested whether philosophical arguments or narratives are more effective at increasing charitable giving. Both narrative and argument conditions increased positive attitudes toward giving and actual donations ($1 more than control), with effects mediated by "narrative transportation" (emotional engagement, imagery, interest). This suggests that appeals work when they engage emotions and interest, regardless of whether they use philosophical reasoning or storytelling. The similar effectiveness of both approaches is surprising given philosophical skepticism about argument's motivational force.

  RELEVANCE: This research illuminates how to communicate about giving norms effectively. The finding that philosophical arguments can be as motivating as narratives (when both engage emotions) suggests that rational arguments for asset-based giving need not be cold and abstract - they can incorporate emotionally engaging elements. The mediation by narrative transportation suggests that effective advocacy for new giving norms (whether income or asset-based) must engage donors' imagination and emotional investment, not just present logical arguments.

  POSITION: Experimental philosophy showing that philosophical arguments about charitable giving can motivate behavior as effectively as narratives, provided both engage emotional and imaginative processes.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This field experiment tests whether charitable appeals emphasizing donor benefits (e.g., "help yourself by helping others") or recipient benefits (e.g., "help others") are more effective. Results show that appeals emphasizing donor benefits (particularly social benefits and warm glow) significantly increased donations, while recipient-focused appeals had weaker effects. This suggests that fundraising is more effective when it aligns with donors' self-interested motivations rather than purely altruistic ones, supporting the impure altruism framework.

  RELEVANCE: This finding has implications for how giving norms are framed and communicated. If donor-focused benefits (social recognition, warm glow, moral satisfaction) drive giving more than impact on recipients, then both income-based and asset-based norms should emphasize these donor benefits. However, this creates tension with effective altruism principles that prioritize impact. The research suggests that purely consequentialist framing of asset-based norms (e.g., "your assets can save more lives") may be less effective than emphasizing personal fulfillment and social recognition from asset-based giving.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Applying the mechanisms of altruism (MOA) approach to blood donation, this review argues that while blood donation as a behavior is altruistic, the motivation may not be pure altruism. Congruency between self-reported motivations and behavioral indices from economic games reveals that blood donation reflects a mixture of warm-glow giving (emotional reward from donating) and reluctant altruism (cooperation despite free-riding temptations) rather than pure concern for recipients. The MOA framework integrates insights from biology, economics, and psychology to characterize donor motivations.

  RELEVANCE: Although focused on blood donation, this framework applies to charitable giving generally and illustrates the importance of distinguishing behavioral versus motivational altruism. For evaluating giving norms, this suggests we should not assume that altruistic behavior implies altruistic motivation - donors may comply with income-based or asset-based norms for various self-interested reasons (habit, social pressure, warm glow) rather than pure concern for recipients. This has implications for which norms will be sustained: those that provide multiple sources of motivation (impact, warm glow, social approval) may be more durable than those relying on pure altruism.

  POSITION: Interdisciplinary framework demonstrating that prosocial behaviors like charitable giving are typically motivated by multiple mechanisms, not pure altruism, with implications for intervention design.

  CORE ARGUMENT: An online experiment (N=960) with realistic simulation of being watched distinguishes self-image from social-image concerns in warm-glow giving. Results show that social image concerns do not increase the likelihood of giving but do increase the amount given when donors choose to give. Self-image concerns affect both the decision to give and the amount. This suggests that charities seeking to expand their donor base should focus on self-image appeals, while those seeking larger donations from existing donors should leverage social-image concerns.

  RELEVANCE: This decomposition of warm glow into self and social components is relevant for designing giving norms. Income-based norms may be more effective at leveraging social-image concerns because regular, visible giving creates more opportunities for social recognition. Asset-based giving, being less frequent and often private, may need to rely more on self-image appeals (moral satisfaction, identity as an effective giver). The finding that social image affects amount but not participation suggests that public recognition programs (e.g., Giving Pledge publicity) may increase giving levels among those already committed without expanding the donor pool.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence distinguishing self-image from social-image motivations in charitable giving, with practical implications for targeting different donor populations.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This experiment isolates motivational crowding out in charitable giving by controlling for strategic considerations. When donors face an unexpected ex post reimbursement (reducing the effective price of giving), donors with high intrinsic motivation substantially decrease subsequent donations compared to those with low intrinsic motivation who did not face the price change. This demonstrates that external interventions can undermine intrinsic motivation to give, particularly among the already-motivated, supporting Frey and Jegen's crowding-out hypothesis.

  RELEVANCE: This finding cautions against assuming that incentives and external pressures always increase giving. If asset-based giving norms are imposed through regulations or strong social pressure, they may crowd out the intrinsic motivation of those already giving generously from income. Conversely, voluntary income-based pledges may sustain intrinsic motivation better by allowing donors to maintain a sense of autonomy. This suggests that the design of giving norms matters as much as their content - coercive or manipulative norms may backfire by undermining the very motivations they seek to harness.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This study provides field evidence that offering extrinsic incentives for charitable giving can demotivate donors and reduce overall donations through motivation crowding out. When a charity introduced rebate incentives for donations, overall giving decreased because the incentives signaled that giving was motivated by self-interest rather than altruism, undermining donors' intrinsic motivation and self-image as altruistic. The effect was strongest for donors who previously gave frequently and in large amounts, suggesting that incentives particularly backfire with already-motivated donors.

  RELEVANCE: This field evidence for crowding out complements the experimental findings and has direct implications for incentive design around giving norms. Tax deductions, matching funds, and social recognition programs (whether for income-based or asset-based giving) may undermine intrinsic motivation for some donors. This suggests that giving norms should be framed primarily in moral terms (what one ought to do) rather than incentive terms (what one benefits from doing), particularly when targeting already-generous donors. The finding that frequent givers are most affected also suggests that habitual income-based giving may be particularly vulnerable to crowding out from explicit incentives.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This cross-cultural study investigates how cultural tightness (strong norms and low tolerance for deviance, as in Korea) versus looseness (weak norms and high tolerance, as in the US) affects charitable giving responses to social norms and observation. People from tight cultures are more likely to comply with donation requests and are less affected by whether others are present (they donate based on internalized norms), while those from loose cultures are more influenced by social observation (they donate more when watched but rely less on internal norms).

  RELEVANCE: This research has implications for the cross-cultural applicability of giving norms. Income-based norms that rely on regular, visible compliance may be more effective in tight cultures where internalized norms drive behavior, while asset-based norms requiring less frequent, less visible giving may face challenges. However, in loose cultures, asset-based norms might need stronger social enforcement (public disclosure, social recognition) to compensate for weaker internalized norm adherence. This suggests that optimal giving norms may vary across cultural contexts, with no universal solution.

  POSITION: Cross-cultural research showing that the effectiveness of social norms and social context in charitable giving depends on broader cultural variation in norm strength (tightness-looseness).
