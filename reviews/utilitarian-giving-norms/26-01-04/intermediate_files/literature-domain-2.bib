====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the economic and philosophical foundations of diminishing
marginal utility as applied to wealth versus income. The literature reveals a
systematic distinction often overlooked in utilitarian theory: marginal utility
behaves differently for flow variables (income) versus stock variables (wealth/
assets). Classical utility theory, stemming from Bernoulli (1738), established
that money exhibits diminishing marginal utility - each additional dollar provides
less satisfaction than the previous one. However, modern behavioral economics
reveals this principle requires refinement when distinguishing income from wealth.

The key insight is that wealth accumulation beyond a security threshold serves
different functions than income. While income addresses ongoing consumption needs
with relatively high marginal utility, accumulated assets primarily serve as
insurance against uncertainty (precautionary motive), positional signaling, or
bequest motives - all of which exhibit lower marginal utility. Recent work on
positional goods (Walasek et al. 2017, Shahar 2017) demonstrates that wealth
often functions as a relative rather than absolute good, diminishing its marginal
utility for welfare. The precautionary savings literature (Horioka & Ventura 2020,
Painter et al. 2021) shows that households accumulate wealth primarily for
insurance, not consumption, which fundamentally changes marginal utility calculations.

The sufficientarian literature (Hassoun 2021, Huseby 2020, Bossert et al. 2021)
introduces the concept of sufficiency thresholds - levels above which distribution
matters less morally. This provides philosophical grounding for the empirical
observation that marginal utility of wealth drops sharply after basic security
needs are met, while income continues to bear higher marginal utility for ongoing
needs.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the central question of whether utilitarian giving
norms should focus on income (flow) or wealth (stock) thresholds. The literature
provides both theoretical and empirical support for distinguishing these variables:
beyond a security threshold, assets exhibit lower marginal utility than income
due to their role in insurance, status-seeking, and bequest rather than direct
consumption. This asymmetry suggests that asset-based giving norms may better
capture utilitarian obligations than income-based norms like the 10% pledge.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few papers directly compare marginal utility of income versus wealth within the
same framework. The connection between sufficientarian thresholds and precautionary
wealth motives remains under-theorized. Limited philosophical attention to how
positional aspects of wealth affect utilitarian calculations. The role of wealth
thresholds in determining charitable obligations is rarely addressed explicitly.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Synthesize the precautionary savings literature with sufficientarian philosophy
to argue for wealth-based thresholds. Connect positional goods theory to the
low marginal utility of excess assets. Contrast the consumption-focused marginal
utility of income with the insurance/status-focused marginal utility of wealth.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Classical diminishing marginal utility: 6 papers - Marginal utility decreases with wealth but doesn't distinguish income from assets
- Precautionary wealth theory: 4 papers - Assets primarily serve insurance function with low marginal utility
- Positional goods theory: 4 papers - Wealth serves relative status function, reducing absolute marginal utility
- Sufficientarianism: 4 papers - Above threshold, distribution matters less; supports differential treatment of assets

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The standard expected utility model, which derives risk aversion
  from diminishing marginal utility of wealth, faces serious empirical challenges.
  The authors argue that while this model has generated important insights,
  alternative models can better capture basic risk aversion intuitions without
  tying them exclusively to wealth's marginal utility. They show that models
  allowing separate treatment of risk preferences and wealth effects can produce
  more nuanced predictions about behavior.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the project's distinction between income and
  wealth. The paper demonstrates that marginal utility of wealth is conceptually
  separable from risk aversion, suggesting wealth accumulation may serve functions
  beyond direct consumption utility. This supports the argument that wealth beyond
  security thresholds has different marginal utility properties than income flows,
  as wealth may primarily address risk/insurance motives rather than consumption.

  POSITION: Critiques standard neoclassical utility theory; argues for refined
  models distinguishing risk preferences from consumption utility.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Observed risk aversion over small gambles is difficult to explain
  via diminishing marginal utility of wealth alone, as Rabin (2000) demonstrated.
  The authors propose that risk aversion results from imprecise mental
  representations rather than wealth effects. They show experimentally that
  people exhibit substantial risk aversion over small stakes that cannot be
  rationalized by any plausible degree of diminishing marginal utility of wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Provides crucial evidence that diminishing marginal utility of wealth
  cannot fully explain observed behavior, suggesting wealth has psychological/
  functional roles beyond direct consumption. This supports distinguishing wealth
  from income in utilitarian calculations: if marginal utility of wealth is
  insufficient to explain risk behavior, wealth likely serves non-consumption
  purposes (insurance, status) with different utility profiles than income.

  POSITION: Behavioral economics challenge to neoclassical utility; demonstrates
  limits of wealth-based marginal utility explanations.

  volume = {28},
  number = {1},
  pages = {138--148},
  doi = {10.1002/JCPY.1012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using millions of Twitter posts, the authors show that mentions
  of luxury/high-status brands (like Rolex, Louis Vuitton) are more frequent in
  U.S. regions with higher income inequality, while everyday brands are mentioned
  more in equal-income regions. This provides large-scale empirical evidence that
  consumption of positional goods increases when the income gap is larger,
  supporting the social rank hypothesis that people allocate more psychological
  resources to status consumption when inequality is high.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates empirically that wealth/assets function as positional
  goods for status signaling, especially in unequal societies. This implies the
  marginal utility of wealth beyond basic needs is largely relative rather than
  absolute - it serves to signal position rather than increase objective welfare.
  This positional aspect dramatically reduces the absolute marginal utility of
  excess wealth, supporting the project's argument that assets above security
  thresholds have lower utilitarian value than income.

  POSITION: Behavioral/empirical support for positional goods theory; demonstrates
  wealth's status-signaling function reduces its absolute welfare benefit.

  volume = {26},
  number = {1},
  pages = {103--120},
  doi = {10.1111/JOPP.12118},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: The existence of positional goods - goods whose value depends on
  one's relative position - provides a distinct egalitarian concern independent
  of prioritarian or sufficientarian worries. When goods are positional, the
  marginal welfare benefit of additional consumption decreases not just because
  of diminishing marginal utility, but because relative position matters. Shahar
  argues this creates a unique moral reason to limit inequality in positional
  goods beyond standard welfare concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical grounding for the claim that wealth beyond
  security serves primarily positional purposes with low absolute marginal utility.
  The paper's analysis suggests that accumulated assets, which often function as
  positional goods (luxury housing, investment portfolios), generate less welfare
  per marginal dollar than income used for direct consumption. This supports
  asset-based rather than income-based giving thresholds in utilitarian frameworks.

  POSITION: Philosophical analysis of positional goods; argues their existence
  creates distinct distributive concerns separate from standard marginal utility.

  pages = {279--293},
  doi = {10.1080/00048402.2019.1620816},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Most analysis of positional goods focuses on downstream
  competition among consumers, but the authors argue that "upstream agency" -
  the actions of those who create and allocate positional goods (like elite
  universities, employers) - deserves more philosophical attention. They develop
  a taxonomy of upstream agents and analyze the moral demands on those who
  control access to positional goods, arguing these agents bear special
  responsibilities for resulting inequalities.

  RELEVANCE: Extends positional goods theory to consider how access to positional
  assets is created and controlled. This is relevant to the project because it
  shows wealth accumulation beyond security often involves competition for
  positional goods (elite schooling, exclusive housing) where marginal utility
  is inherently relative. The analysis supports treating wealth differently from
  income in utilitarian frameworks, as wealth increasingly serves positional
  rather than absolute welfare functions.

  POSITION: Expands positional goods theory to include analysis of suppliers and
  allocators; emphasizes structural aspects of positional competition.

  number = {3},
  pages = {263--283},
  doi = {10.1017/s0953820820000497},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Sufficiency theorists claim we must provide everyone with
  "enough," but few well-worked-out accounts of the sufficiency threshold exist.
  Hassoun proposes a mechanism for arriving at an account of the minimally good
  life that can help locate the sufficiency threshold. She argues this threshold
  should be based on what people need to function as autonomous agents and live
  minimally good lives, going beyond basic needs but falling short of full
  flourishing. The threshold is independently specifiable and provides practical
  policy guidance.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for the concept of sufficiency
  thresholds that is central to the project's argument about wealth versus income.
  If there exists a specifiable threshold above which additional resources matter
  less morally, this supports treating wealth above this threshold differently
  than income. The paper's analysis suggests that once security needs are met
  through adequate assets, the marginal moral importance of additional wealth
  decreases sharply, while income continues to address ongoing needs.

  account of sufficiency threshold for policy applications.

  number = {2},
  pages = {207--223},
  doi = {10.1007/s10892-020-09321-4},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses the "threshold objection" to sufficientarianism: how
  can there be a sharp threshold such that distribution is highly important just
  below it but not required at all above it? Huseby proposes that sufficientarianism
  requires two separate thresholds that may or may not overlap - one marking where
  urgent needs are met, another marking where additional benefits become less
  morally important. This two-threshold structure avoids the counterintuitive
  discontinuity while preserving sufficientarian insights.

  RELEVANCE: The two-threshold approach maps well onto the income/wealth distinction
  in the project. A lower threshold (basic consumption needs) and upper threshold
  (security through adequate assets) could justify different treatment of income
  versus wealth. Below the lower threshold, both income and assets are urgent;
  between thresholds, income for consumption remains important while additional
  assets for security become saturated; above the upper threshold, both matter
  less but wealth (serving mainly positional purposes) even more so.

  POSITION: Refined sufficientarianism with dual thresholds; addresses key
  objections to sufficiency views while preserving their insights.

  volume = {30},
  number = {1},
  pages = {75--99},
  doi = {10.1111/jopp.12267},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops a formal axiological framework for sufficientarianism
  based on absolute priority to those below a threshold. The authors combine
  sufficientarian principles with utilitarian axioms to derive "critical-level
  sufficientarianism," which applies critical-level generalized utilitarianism
  below the threshold and uses it as a tie-breaker above. They prove this is the
  unique class of rankings satisfying both absolute priority and utilitarian
  continuity conditions, providing rigorous foundations for sufficiency views.

  RELEVANCE: Provides rigorous formal framework for incorporating thresholds into
  utilitarian theory. The absolute priority principle supports the project's claim
  that resources below a sufficiency threshold (whether income or wealth) demand
  urgent attention, while resources above matter less. The framework allows for
  different treatment of income and wealth if they relate differently to the
  threshold - income addressing ongoing needs, wealth addressing security threshold.

  sufficiency concerns with utilitarian frameworks.

  number = {3},
  pages = {575--597},
  doi = {10.1007/s11150-020-09486-y},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Italian household panel data, the authors find that retired
  elderly decumulate wealth much more slowly than expected - more than 40% continue
  accumulating wealth and over 80% do positive saving. Regression analysis reveals
  this slower-than-expected decumulation is due primarily to bequest motives and
  precautionary saving (especially the former). This demonstrates the "Wealth
  Decumulation Puzzle": even in retirement when income is low, people hold onto
  assets for non-consumption purposes.

  RELEVANCE: Provides strong empirical evidence that wealth serves fundamentally
  different purposes than income - primarily bequest and insurance motives rather
  than consumption. This supports the project's core claim: assets beyond security
  thresholds have low marginal utility for the holder's consumption, as evidenced
  by retirees not consuming them despite low income. This asymmetry between wealth
  (held for non-consumption reasons) and income (consumed for ongoing needs)
  justifies different utilitarian treatment of the two.

  number = {2},
  pages = {327--363},
  doi = {10.1007/s11150-021-09578-3},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Extending their Italian analysis to multiple European countries
  using SHARE data, the authors find less than half of retired elderly decumulate
  wealth and average wealth accumulation is positive (6.6% over 3 years). This
  pan-European evidence confirms the Wealth Decumulation Puzzle applies broadly.
  Regression results attribute slow decumulation to bequest motives, generous
  public pensions (reducing need to consume assets), and reluctance to liquidate
  owner-occupied housing - all non-consumption motives for holding wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Broadens empirical support across Europe for the claim that wealth
  serves non-consumption purposes (insurance, bequest, housing security) with
  lower marginal utility than income. The finding that generous pensions (higher
  income) allow wealth retention demonstrates the distinction: when income needs
  are met, people don't consume assets, revealing assets' primary functions are
  insurance and bequest. This systematic difference supports asset-based rather
  than income-based giving thresholds.

  demonstrates insurance/security functions of wealth versus consumption function
  of income.

  number = {2},
  pages = {761--789},
  doi = {10.1017/S0022109021000065},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using Chinese household panel data where housing equity cannot
  be withdrawn (eliminating collateral channel), the authors isolate the wealth
  effect of housing on consumption. They find a 1% housing wealth increase raises
  consumption by 0.14% (marginal propensity to consume of 0.023). Crucially, this
  effect is largest among employees facing greater income uncertainty, demonstrating
  that housing wealth operates primarily through precautionary savings motives
  rather than direct consumption.

  RELEVANCE: Provides clean empirical evidence that wealth accumulation (here,
  housing) serves primarily as insurance against income uncertainty, with very
  low marginal propensity to consume (2.3%). This directly supports the project's
  argument: wealth's main function is precautionary/insurance with low marginal
  consumption utility, while income addresses direct consumption needs with higher
  marginal utility. The finding that this pattern is strongest for those with
  income uncertainty further distinguishes wealth's insurance role from income's
  consumption role.

  low marginal consumption utility of wealth when controlling for credit effects.

  journal = {SocArXiv},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.31235/osf.io/xsqzp},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: While universal basic income (UBI) is often defended on
  utilitarian grounds for increasing welfare, the author argues a non-universal
  basic income adjusted for prior income and wealth would better maximize welfare.
  The key insight is applying diminishing marginal utility correctly: those with
  lower prior income and wealth benefit more from transfers. Therefore, a means-
  tested system targeting the poor is more effective at maximizing total and
  average welfare than a universal system giving equal amounts regardless of
  existing resources.

  RELEVANCE: Directly applies diminishing marginal utility to policy design,
  demonstrating that prior wealth and income matter for determining marginal
  utility of transfers. This supports the project's core claim that marginal
  utility calculations should consider both income and wealth stocks. The argument
  that adjusted transfers maximize welfare better than universal ones parallels
  the argument that giving norms should consider accumulated assets, not just
  income flows, when determining obligations.

  POSITION: Applied utilitarian analysis using diminishing marginal utility;
  argues for wealth-adjusted rather than universal policies.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive review of wealth research covering trends,
  determinants, and consequences. The authors address methodological challenges
  including wealth's cumulative nature and highly skewed distribution. They review
  evidence that wealth is a distinct stratification indicator from income, with
  different determinants (inheritance, capital gains) and different effects on
  outcomes. The review emphasizes wealth's role in providing security, opportunity,
  and intergenerational advantage beyond current consumption.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes wealth as conceptually and empirically distinct from
  income in stratification research, supporting the project's argument for
  differential treatment. The review's evidence that wealth provides security,
  opportunity, and status rather than just consumption aligns with the claim that
  wealth's marginal utility functions differently than income's. The emphasis on
  inheritance and capital gains as wealth sources (versus labor income) further

  number = {2},
  pages = {117--142},
  doi = {10.1515/krt-2015-290206},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to the objection that sufficientarianism is objectionably
  indifferent to distribution above the threshold. Kanschik argues sufficientarianism
  warrants progressive taxation because even those above sufficiency face risks
  of falling below it, and this risk decreases the better off someone is. Those
  closer to the threshold face greater risk of insufficiency, justifying
  progressive taxation that corresponds to distance from threshold rather than
  prioritarian or egalitarian concerns.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical justification for differential treatment based
  on distance from sufficiency threshold, relevant to the project's argument about
  wealth thresholds. The risk-based rationale applies well to asset holdings:
  those with minimal assets face high risk of falling into poverty (high marginal
  utility of additional assets), while those with substantial assets face low
  risk (low marginal utility of additional assets). This supports progressive
  obligations based on wealth holdings.

  doi = {10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.03.019},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the tension between ecological sufficiency (limiting
  resource consumption to sustainable levels) and individual liberty. The authors
  develop a framework for eco-sufficiency policies that respects both sustainability
  constraints and distributive justice. They argue that sufficiency thresholds
  can be compatible with liberty if upper limits on consumption are combined with
  fair distribution below those limits, and if limits are genuinely necessary for
  sustainability.

  RELEVANCE: Extends sufficiency thinking to ecological contexts, relevant to the
  project's broader implications. If environmental sustainability requires
  consumption limits, and wealth beyond thresholds often enables excess consumption
  (luxury goods, multiple properties), then sufficiency arguments support limits
  on wealth accumulation for ecological as well as distributive reasons. The
  framework suggests wealth thresholds serve multiple functions: distributive
  justice, diminishing marginal utility, and ecological sustainability.

  title = {The Effect of Wealth on Worker Productivity},
  journal = {Working Paper},
  year = {2020},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how wealth holdings affect labor market productivity
  and job matching. The authors find that wealth reduces work effort and job
  search intensity, creating labor market inefficiencies. Workers with more wealth
  can afford to be more selective about jobs and work less intensively, suggesting
  wealth provides insurance/optionality that affects behavior beyond direct
  consumption. This wealth effect on labor supply implies wealth's marginal utility
  operates through option value and flexibility rather than consumption.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that wealth affects behavior through insurance/optionality
  mechanisms distinct from consumption, supporting the project's claim about
  wealth's different marginal utility function. The finding that wealth reduces
  labor effort suggests wealth above security thresholds provides option value
  rather than consumption utility - a fundamentally different function than income.
  This distinction supports treating wealth differently in utilitarian frameworks.

  doi = {10.1093/oep/gpad034},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether public provision of positional goods can address
  inefficiencies from excessive private consumption driven by relative-standing
  externalities. The authors show that offering free or subsidized public
  alternatives to private positional goods can reduce excessive consumption and
  increase welfare. They characterize conditions under which public provision
  achieves efficiency, typically when non-positional utility is sufficiently
  important and consumers face discrete choices between public and private options.

  RELEVANCE: Analyzes policy responses to positional consumption, relevant to the
  project's treatment of wealth as positional. If much wealth accumulation serves
  positional purposes (luxury housing, exclusive education), its marginal social
  utility is low due to relative-standing externalities - one person's gain is
  another's loss. This positional aspect implies wealth beyond security has even
  lower marginal utility than standard diminishing returns would suggest,

  doi = {10.1016/j.socec.2024.102184},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Investigates the origins of positional concerns using experimental
  and survey methods. The authors find substantial heterogeneity in which goods
  people consider positional and in the strength of positional concerns across
  individuals. They identify that positional concerns stem partly from innate
  preferences but are also shaped by social context and experience with inequality.
  The findings suggest positionality is not fixed but responds to institutional
  and cultural factors.

  RELEVANCE: Demonstrates that positional aspects of consumption vary by good type
  and individual, with implications for wealth versus income. Wealth holdings
  (property, investments, luxury goods) are more likely to be treated as positional
  than income flows used for ordinary consumption. This differential positionality
  implies wealth's marginal utility is more affected by relative-standing concerns
  than income's, further supporting the asymmetry central to the project's argument.

  heterogeneity in positional concerns across goods and people.
