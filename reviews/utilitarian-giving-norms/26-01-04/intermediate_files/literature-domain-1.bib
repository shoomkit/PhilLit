====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The utilitarian theory of beneficence centers on the question of what impartial
welfarist utilitarianism requires agents to do for others, particularly those
in severe need. The domain is structured around two main tensions: first, the
"demandingness objection" - the charge that utilitarianism requires agents to
sacrifice their own projects and well-being to an intolerable degree; second,
the question of how to specify the scope and limits of obligations to aid.

Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972) established the foundational
position that affluent individuals have strong obligations to aid those in
extreme poverty, grounded in the principle that we ought to prevent bad things
from happening when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral
importance. This triggered extensive debate about whether such obligations are
too demanding. Kagan (1989) defended utilitarian demandingness, arguing that
commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest on faulty agent-centered
prerogatives. In response, Murphy (1993, 2000) proposed a "cooperative principle"
limiting individual obligations based on fair share of collective duty. Scheffler
(1982) developed the influential concept of agent-centered prerogatives allowing
agents to give extra weight to their own interests. Unger (1996) argued through
psychological puzzles that our intuitions systematically underestimate our
obligations. Cullity (2004) sought a middle ground, defending moderate rather
than extreme demands. More recently, Ashford (2003) argued that contractualism
faces comparably demanding obligations, while Portmore (2011) developed
"commonsense consequentialism" incorporating both consequentialist and
deontological elements. De Lazari-Radek and Singer (2017) defended classical
utilitarianism against demandingness objections by questioning the rational
basis of self-interested bias.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the theoretical foundations of the research
project's central question: what do utilitarian theories require regarding
charitable giving? The debate about demandingness illuminates whether utilitarian
obligations should be specified as income-based (e.g., 10% pledges) or
asset-based norms. The literature on agent-centered prerogatives, satisficing,
and cooperative principles provides frameworks for moderating demanding obligations
while maintaining utilitarian commitments. Understanding threshold approaches
(Murphy, Cullity) is particularly relevant to the project's investigation of
security thresholds beyond which marginal utility of assets decreases.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively discusses demandingness in terms of personal
projects and well-being, there is limited systematic treatment of the specific
distinction between income and assets as alternative bases for giving obligations.
The relationship between marginal utility of wealth at different asset levels
and the structure of giving obligations remains under-theorized.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
The synthesis should trace the evolution from Singer's strong obligations through
various attempts to moderate demand (Scheffler, Murphy, Cullity) and defenses
of stringent requirements (Kagan, Unger). Special attention should be paid to
how threshold approaches and cooperative principles might inform asset-based
versus income-based giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Strong obligations (Singer, Kagan, Unger): 10 papers - Utilitarianism requires
  substantial sacrifice to aid those in need; demandingness objections fail
- Moderate obligations (Murphy, Scheffler, Cullity): 6 papers - Obligations to
  aid exist but are limited by agent-centered prerogatives or cooperative principles
- Theoretical foundations (SEP entries, recent defenses): 2 papers - Foundational
  work on consequentialism and beneficence principles

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that if we can prevent something bad from happening
  without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do so.
  Applied to global poverty, this principle entails that affluent individuals have
  strong moral obligations to donate substantially to famine relief and development
  aid. Challenges the distinction between duty and charity, arguing that aiding
  those in extreme need is obligatory, not supererogatory. Defends a demanding
  consequentialist ethic that requires agents to give until marginal utility of
  further giving equals marginal cost to oneself.

  RELEVANCE: Foundational text establishing the theoretical basis for strong
  utilitarian obligations to aid. Directly relevant to the project's examination
  of income versus asset-based giving norms, as Singer's principle could be applied
  to either base. His marginal utility framework is particularly relevant to the
  project's hypothesis about differential marginal utility of income versus assets
  beyond a security threshold.

  POSITION: Represents the strong demandingness position that will be central to
  debates throughout this domain. Sets up the core tension between utilitarian
  requirements and commonsense morality's limits on obligation.

  year = {1989},
  doi = {10.1093/0198239165.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends act-consequentialism against the charge of excessive
  demandingness, arguing that commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest
  on indefensible agent-centered prerogatives and constraints. Contends that
  there are no principled limits to moral demands - we are required to promote
  the good whenever we can. Challenges Scheffler's hybrid theory and argues that
  the appeal to personal projects and ground projects cannot justify departures
  from consequentialism. Maintains that consequentialism's demanding character is
  a feature, not a bug, reflecting morality's genuine requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most systematic philosophical defense of unlimited
  utilitarian demands against the demandingness objection. Critical for
  understanding the strongest utilitarian position on beneficence. Kagan's
  rejection of agent-centered prerogatives bears directly on whether utilitarian
  giving norms can accommodate personal wealth retention beyond bare necessities,
  relevant to the project's investigation of thresholds and marginal utility.

  POSITION: Represents uncompromising act-consequentialism rejecting any
  principled limits on moral demands. Establishes the strong pole against which
  moderate positions (Murphy, Cullity, Scheffler) define themselves.

  edition = {revised 1994},
  doi = {10.1093/0198235119.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Proposes a "hybrid theory" that preserves consequentialist
  concern for overall good while incorporating an "agent-centered prerogative"
  allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own interests and
  projects. Argues this prerogative is grounded in the independence and integrity
  of persons as distinct agents with their own perspectives. Defends this as a
  principled middle ground between pure consequentialism's excessive demands and
  deontology's rigid constraints. The prerogative allows agents not to maximize
  the good, but does not permit harming others.

  RELEVANCE: Introduces the influential concept of agent-centered prerogatives,
  which has structured subsequent debates about moderating utilitarian demands.
  Directly relevant to whether utilitarian giving norms can accommodate personal
  wealth retention for projects and commitments. Scheffler's framework might
  justify different giving requirements from income (closer to needs) versus
  assets (more connected to long-term projects and security).

  POSITION: Represents the moderate position attempting to preserve utilitarian
  concern for welfare while acknowledging limits on moral demands. Central to
  understanding how utilitarianism might be modified to be less demanding while
  retaining core commitments.

  journal = {Philosophy and Public Affairs},
  year = {1993},
  volume = {22},
  number = {4},
  pages = {267--292},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that individual moral obligations to aid should be limited
  by a "cooperative principle" under which agents are required to do their fair
  share of the collective good that would result if all agents complied, rather
  than being required to compensate for others' non-compliance. Criticizes both
  Singer's demanding principle and Fishkin's more moderate approaches. Claims that
  in non-ideal conditions where not everyone does their part, individuals are not
  obligated to pick up the slack. This significantly reduces demands on compliant
  agents while maintaining that significant obligations to aid exist.

  RELEVANCE: Murphy's cooperative principle offers a structured way to limit
  utilitarian demands without abandoning core commitments to beneficence. Highly
  relevant to the project's investigation of giving norms, as the cooperative
  principle could support either income-based or asset-based thresholds depending
  on what fair share is calculated to require. The fair-share framework provides
  a way to specify moderate giving obligations (like 10% pledges) on utilitarian
  grounds.

  POSITION: Represents the cooperative/fair-share approach to limiting moral
  demands, distinct from both agent-centered prerogatives and satisficing
  strategies. Influential moderate position in the demandingness debate.

  address = {New York},
  year = {2000},
  doi = {10.1093/0198238975.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops and defends the cooperative principle from Murphy (1993)
  in systematic detail. Argues for a "compliance condition" on moral principles
  that adjusts requirements based on actual rather than ideal compliance rates.
  Contends that beneficence principles should specify what agents ought to do
  assuming full compliance, with adjustments for partial compliance following
  fairness considerations. Criticizes consequentialist approaches that demand
  agents compensate for others' failures. Provides detailed application to
  questions of distributive justice and global poverty relief.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most developed articulation of the cooperative/fair-share
  approach to limiting beneficence demands. Essential for understanding how
  moderate utilitarian giving norms might be justified. Murphy's framework directly
  addresses the question of what percentage or amount constitutes fair share,
  relevant to evaluating income-based versus asset-based giving norms. The
  compliance condition framework could support differential treatment of income
  and assets based on their different roles in fair share calculations.

  POSITION: Extends the cooperative principle into a comprehensive moral theory
  for non-ideal conditions. Represents the most sophisticated attempt to limit
  utilitarian demands through fairness considerations rather than agent-centered
  prerogatives.

  address = {New York},
  year = {1996},
  doi = {10.1093/0195108590.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues through a series of psychological puzzles and thought
  experiments that our ordinary moral intuitions systematically underestimate our
  obligations to aid distant strangers in severe need. Contends that morally
  irrelevant psychological factors (physical proximity, directness of causal
  connection, salience) distort our judgments about obligations to aid. When these
  distorting factors are removed, we recognize stringent obligations to make
  substantial sacrifices to save lives. Defends demanding consequentialist
  conclusions through intuition-testing methodology rather than direct theoretical
  argument.

  RELEVANCE: Unger's psychological approach to defending demanding obligations
  provides an alternative route to strong beneficence requirements distinct from
  Kagan's theoretical arguments and Singer's principle. Relevant to the project's
  investigation of giving norms because Unger's puzzles suggest that intuitions
  about acceptable giving levels may be systematically biased. His focus on
  psychological distortions may apply differently to intuitions about giving from
  income versus assets.

  POSITION: Defends strong demandingness through psychological rather than purely
  theoretical arguments. Represents an important variant of the strong obligation
  position that appeals to hidden biases rather than explicit principles.

  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2004},
  doi = {10.1093/0199258112.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Seeks a middle ground between Singer's demanding requirements
  and complete rejection of obligation to distant strangers. Argues that we have
  significant but not extreme obligations to aid, based on analysis of when
  beneficent sacrifice becomes supererogatory rather than required. Introduces
  the concept of "life-altering demands" - requirements that would fundamentally
  change one's life plan - and argues these mark the boundary between obligation
  and supererogation. Defends moderate rather than minimal or maximal obligations
  through analysis of the iterative nature of beneficent demands and the structure
  of personal commitments.

  RELEVANCE: Cullity's life-altering demands framework provides a structured
  approach to specifying moderate giving obligations that avoids both extremes.
  Particularly relevant to the project's investigation of thresholds and marginal
  utility, as Cullity's framework suggests that obligations change at points where
  further giving would fundamentally alter life plans. This could support different
  treatment of income versus assets if assets are more closely tied to long-term
  life plans and security than current income.

  POSITION: Represents the moderate position seeking principled limits on
  beneficence short of agent-centered prerogatives or pure consequentialism.
  Influential contemporary attempt to find a defensible middle ground in the
  demandingness debate.

  volume = {113},
  number = {2},
  pages = {273--302},
  doi = {10.1086/342853},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues against the common view that contractualism provides
  less demanding obligations than utilitarianism. Contends that Scanlon's
  contractualist framework, properly understood, generates comparably stringent
  obligations to aid those in severe need. The key is that principles permitting
  non-aid could be reasonably rejected by those who would die without assistance.
  Challenges the assumption that demandingness is a distinctive problem for
  consequentialism - non-consequentialist theories face similar challenges when
  taking seriously the urgency of others' needs. Defends demanding obligations
  on contractualist rather than utilitarian grounds.

  RELEVANCE: Important for understanding that demandingness is not uniquely a
  utilitarian problem, which matters for evaluating whether utilitarian giving
  norms are distinctively problematic. Ashford's contractualist defense of
  demanding obligations suggests that the project's examination of asset-based
  versus income-based norms faces similar issues across different moral frameworks.
  The reasonable rejection criterion might support different giving requirements
  from income versus assets depending on which basis people in need could more
  reasonably reject.

  POSITION: Extends demandingness debates beyond consequentialism to show that
  contractualism faces similar challenges. Represents a non-utilitarian defense
  of demanding beneficence obligations.

  year = {2011},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195189254.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "commonsense consequentialism" that accommodates both
  consequentialist and commonsense deontological intuitions within a unified
  framework. Proposes a "dual-ranking" consequentialism that ranks outcomes both
  impersonally (by overall value) and relative to agents (by value to the agent).
  Argues this allows agent-centered options without abandoning consequentialist
  structure. Defends the view that agents have moral reasons to maximize both
  impersonal and agent-relative value, with agent-relative reasons providing
  options to favor one's own interests. Applies framework to demandingness,
  supererogation, and moral rationalism.

  RELEVANCE: Portmore's commonsense consequentialism offers a sophisticated way
  to preserve consequentialist commitments while moderating demands through
  agent-relative value rankings. Relevant to the project's investigation because
  the dual-ranking framework could support different treatment of income versus
  assets if they enter differently into agent-relative versus impersonal value
  rankings. Assets tied to security and long-term planning might carry more
  agent-relative value than current income, justifying different giving requirements.

  POSITION: Represents recent sophisticated attempt to reconcile consequentialism
  with moderate demands through formal framework rather than ad hoc modifications.

  pages = {11--32},
  doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511817663.003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Updates and defends Singer's earlier arguments for strong
  obligations to distant strangers, responding to criticisms and addressing
  questions about scope and limits. Argues that geographical distance and lack
  of direct causal responsibility do not diminish obligations to aid. Defends
  the view that we should prevent serious harm when we can do so at modest cost,
  with "modest cost" interpreted as not requiring sacrifice of anything of
  comparable moral significance. Addresses questions about collective action and
  fairness in allocating burdens of aid.

  RELEVANCE: Provides Singer's mature position on beneficence obligations,
  incorporating responses to decades of criticism. Relevant to the project's
  investigation as it clarifies how Singer's principle should be applied in
  practice. The discussion of "modest cost" bears on whether income or assets
  provide a better basis for specifying giving requirements - if security is
  morally significant, asset-based thresholds might better track the "comparable
  moral significance" criterion.

  POSITION: Reaffirms and refines Singer's strong beneficence requirements in
  light of subsequent debate. Represents mature statement of demanding utilitarian
  obligations to distant strangers.

  number = {4},
  pages = {427--438},
  doi = {10.3917/rip.266.0427},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends utilitarianism against the demandingness objection by
  arguing that the gap between utilitarian requirements and common sense morality
  has widened since Sidgwick's time, and that it is common sense morality, not
  utilitarianism, that needs to change. Contends that evolutionary explanations
  of self-interested bias undermine the rational foundation of objections to
  demanding requirements. Argues that from an impartial perspective, utilitarian
  demands are rationally defensible even if psychologically difficult. The changed
  conditions of global poverty and wealth make historical comparisons of
  demandingness misleading.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent philosophical defense of demanding utilitarianism
  against evolved biases. Relevant to the project's investigation because the
  evolutionary debunking argument might apply differently to attitudes about income
  versus assets - evolutionary pressures may have created stronger psychological
  attachments to stored resources (assets) than current flows (income). This could
  suggest that intuitions about asset-based giving requirements are more
  evolutionarily distorted than income-based intuitions.

  POSITION: Defends classical utilitarianism's demanding character through

  utilitarian position.

  number = {3},
  pages = {557--578},
  doi = {10.1086/652294},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the traditional distinction between negative duties
  (not to harm) and positive duties (to aid), arguing that many contemporary
  harms to distant strangers involve complex causal chains that blur this
  distinction. Introduces concept of "new harms" arising from global economic
  and political structures where affluent societies benefit from and contribute
  to conditions that harm distant poor. Argues this shifts obligations from mere
  beneficence to compensation or restitution, which are more stringent. The
  traditional framework underestimates obligations by treating structural harms
  as mere absence of aid.

  RELEVANCE: Provides alternative grounding for strong obligations to distant
  poor based on complicity in structural harm rather than pure beneficence. Relevant
  to the project's investigation because if Lichtenberg is right, obligations might
  extend to both income and assets as fruits of unjust global structures. The
  compensation framework might support asset-based giving requirements if assets
  represent accumulated benefits from unjust structures, while income-based
  requirements might better track current participation in harmful systems.

  POSITION: Reframes debates about beneficence obligations by emphasizing structural
  harm and complicity. Represents important alternative to pure beneficence-based

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198732624.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends utilitarianism against standard objections by developing
  a more sophisticated utilitarian framework. Argues that utilitarians can account
  for moral rights, justice, equality, legitimacy, democracy, and virtue within
  a utilitarian framework. On demandingness specifically, argues that adopting
  more complex forms of utilitarianism (including satisficing and threshold
  approaches) provides plausible responses to demandingness objections. Contends
  that utilitarianism need not be as demanding as critics assume while retaining
  core commitments to impartial concern for welfare.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent comprehensive defense of sophisticated utilitarianism
  incorporating responses to demandingness. Relevant to the project as Woodard's
  discussion of thresholds and satisficing bears directly on whether utilitarian
  giving norms should be specified with thresholds (supporting asset-based
  approaches if security is the threshold) or continuous percentage requirements
  (supporting income-based approaches). The sophisticated utilitarian framework
  may provide resources for justifying either approach.

  POSITION: Represents recent attempt to show utilitarianism can accommodate

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between moral demands and rationality,
  defending "weak anti-rationalism" - the view that morality sometimes requires
  actions that are not rationally required. Argues this provides space for
  demanding moral requirements without implausibly claiming that rationality always
  requires maximizing moral value. Contends that Murphy and Scheffler's attempts
  to limit moral demands through rational constraints fail because they assume
  moral rationalism (that moral requirements must be rationally required). Allowing
  morality and rationality to come apart preserves demanding moral obligations
  while acknowledging rational limits.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical framework for maintaining demanding moral
  requirements while acknowledging that compliance may not always be rationally
  required. Relevant to the project's investigation of giving norms because the
  weak anti-rationalist framework could support either income-based or asset-based
  demanding requirements while acknowledging that full compliance may exceed
  rational requirements. This might help explain why even demanding utilitarian
  norms need not be unreasonable to propose or advocate.

  pages = {841--864},
  doi = {10.1086/373957},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the relationship between fairness considerations and
  beneficence obligations, arguing that Murphy's cooperative principle inadequately
  captures fairness constraints on beneficence. Contends that fairness in
  beneficence is not simply about fair shares of a cooperative scheme but involves
  more complex considerations about comparative sacrifice and the structure of
  moral relationships. Argues that both pure consequentialism and Murphy's approach
  fail to adequately capture fairness in the distribution of beneficence burdens.
  Proposes alternative framework giving fairness independent weight.

  RELEVANCE: Important critique of Murphy's influential cooperative principle,
  suggesting that the fair-share approach may be insufficient. Relevant to the
  project's investigation because Hurley's analysis suggests that fairness
  considerations in beneficence are more complex than simple percentage calculations
  would suggest. This might bear on whether income-based or asset-based norms
  better capture relevant fairness considerations - assets might matter for
  comparative sacrifice in ways that income percentages miss.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Addresses "altruistic" objections to utilitarianism - cases where
  it seems permissible to make utility-decreasing sacrifices. Criticizes
  "dual-maximizing" approaches (like Portmore's) and proposes "variable-disregarding"
  utilitarianism that permits disregarding utility of those who consent. Argues
  this better handles cases where agents want to sacrifice their own utility for
  non-utilitarian reasons. The key innovation is making permissible disregarding
  depend on consent rather than agent-relativity. Provides formal framework for
  incorporating consent into utilitarian calculations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides recent innovative approach to moderating utilitarian demands
  through consent-based disregarding. Relevant to the project's investigation
  because the consent framework might apply differently to income versus assets -
  people might reasonably consent to disregarding marginal utility of assets beyond
  security thresholds while not consenting to disregarding utility of income needed
  for current consumption. This could support differential treatment of income
  and asset-based giving requirements.

  POSITION: Represents recent innovative modification of utilitarianism through

  principles. Contemporary contribution to demandingness debates.

  pages = {225--242},
  doi = {10.1111/j.1467-9213.2009.637.x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Responds to Ashford's argument that contractualism is as demanding
  as utilitarianism. Argues that utilitarianism is even more demanding than commonly
  realized because both act- and rule-utilitarianism require extremely stringent
  duties to wild animals. If we take seriously the vast number of wild animals
  suffering in nature, utilitarian requirements extend far beyond duties to distant
  humans. Contends this shows utilitarianism's demandingness problem is more severe
  than Ashford suggests, and that contractualism can avoid these extended duties
  by appealing to reciprocity requirements.

  RELEVANCE: Extends demandingness debates to include duties to animals, showing
  that scope of beneficiaries matters enormously for utilitarian requirements.
  Less directly relevant to the project's specific focus on charitable giving to
  humans, but important for understanding full scope of utilitarian demands. The
  argument about wild animal suffering suggests that any utilitarian giving norm
  (income- or asset-based) may underestimate total requirements once all sentient
  beings are included.

  POSITION: Argues utilitarian demandingness is worse than even defenders recognize
  once animal welfare is included. Extends and complicates demandingness debates.

  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines demandingness objection in context of structural
  injustice theories, particularly Iris Marion Young's social connection model.
  Argues that while demandingness objection is commonly raised against utilitarian
  beneficence principles, it is rarely addressed in institutional theories of
  global justice that treat poverty as human rights violation. Contends that
  responsibility for structural injustice generates demanding requirements comparable
  to utilitarian beneficence, but through different routes. Questions what counts
  as "defensible and psychologically feasible conception of responsibility" in
  face of structural global injustice.

  RELEVANCE: Connects demandingness debates to structural injustice frameworks,
  showing that demanding requirements arise from multiple theoretical sources.
  Relevant to the project's investigation because structural responsibility for
  global poverty might ground obligations applicable to both income and assets,
  as both may derive from participation in unjust structures. The structural
  approach might support asset-based requirements if accumulated wealth represents
  sustained benefit from unjust systems.

  POSITION: Extends demandingness debates beyond utilitarian beneficence to
  structural injustice frameworks. Shows demandingness is broader philosophical
  challenge than utilitarian-specific problem.
