## Section 2: The Marginal Utility Asymmetry Between Income and Wealth

A central premise of utilitarian giving norms is that resources transferred from donors to recipients generate greater welfare gains at the margin. Yet existing frameworks typically operationalize this through income percentages without interrogating whether accumulated wealth exhibits the same marginal utility profile as ongoing income. This section marshals converging evidence from behavioral economics, positional goods theory, and sufficientarian philosophy to argue that assets beyond a security threshold have systematically lower marginal utility than income, justifying differential treatment in philanthropic frameworks.

### 2.1 Precautionary Savings and the Insurance Function of Wealth

Empirical research on household wealth behavior reveals a striking puzzle: retirees systematically fail to decumulate assets at rates standard consumption theory predicts. \citet{horioka2020wealth}, analyzing Italian household panel data, find that over 40% of retired elderly continue accumulating wealth, with more than 80% maintaining positive savings despite declining income. Their pan-European extension using SHARE data confirms this pattern broadly: average wealth accumulation among retirees runs positive at 6.6% over three years, with less than half decumulating at all \citep{horioka2022retired}. This "wealth decumulation puzzle" demonstrates that assets serve fundamentally different purposes than income—primarily insurance against uncertainty and bequest vehicles rather than consumption funds.

The precautionary motive emerges most clearly when examining housing wealth. \citet{painter2021housing} exploit a natural experiment in urban China where housing equity cannot be withdrawn, isolating the pure wealth effect from credit channels. Their findings are remarkable: a 1% increase in housing wealth raises consumption by only 0.14%, yielding a marginal propensity to consume of merely 2.3%. Crucially, this already-small effect concentrates among employees facing greater income uncertainty, confirming that housing wealth operates through precautionary motives rather than direct consumption. When households perceive their income as secure, housing wealth has virtually no consumption effect—it functions purely as insurance.

These findings challenge the standard expected utility framework that undergirds much utilitarian reasoning about resource allocation. As \citet{odono2018modeling} demonstrate, the traditional model deriving risk aversion from diminishing marginal utility of wealth faces serious empirical difficulties. Their analysis shows that risk preferences and wealth effects are conceptually separable: wealth may provide security and option value without necessarily translating into proportional consumption utility. This theoretical refinement supports treating wealth's marginal utility as distinct from income's—assets provide insurance, flexibility, and security, but these functions saturate at levels far below where consumption utility from income plateaus.

### 2.2 Positional Goods and the Status Function of Wealth

Beyond insurance, wealth increasingly serves positional rather than absolute welfare functions as it accumulates beyond security thresholds. \citet{walasek2017positional} provide striking empirical evidence using millions of Twitter posts across U.S. regions: mentions of luxury brands (Rolex, Louis Vuitton) correlate positively with regional income inequality, while everyday brands show the opposite pattern. This large-scale behavioral data confirms that consumption of positional goods intensifies precisely where relative standing is more salient. Wealth accumulated beyond basic needs increasingly purchases relative position rather than absolute welfare.

The philosophical implications are developed by \citet{shahar2017positional}, who argues that positional goods generate egalitarian concerns independent of prioritarian or standard welfare considerations. When goods are positional, marginal utility decreases not merely through diminishing returns but because one person's gain constitutes another's relative loss. This zero-sum dimension dramatically reduces the absolute marginal utility of excess wealth: positional competition produces no net welfare gain while consuming resources. Shahar's analysis suggests accumulated assets—luxury housing, exclusive education, investment portfolios signaling status—have even lower utilitarian value than standard diminishing marginal utility would predict.

\citet{halliday2020positional} extend this analysis to "upstream agency," examining how access to positional goods is created and allocated. Their taxonomy reveals that much wealth accumulation involves competition for goods whose value is inherently relative: elite university admissions, exclusive neighborhoods, scarce luxury items. This structural analysis reinforces the distinction between income (addressing ongoing consumption needs with relatively stable marginal utility) and wealth (increasingly channeled toward positional competition where marginal social utility approaches zero). The positional dimension constitutes a distinct reason—beyond standard diminishing returns—for treating accumulated assets differently from income flows in utilitarian frameworks.

### 2.3 Sufficientarian Thresholds and Asset Treatment

Sufficientarian philosophy provides principled foundations for threshold-based treatment that maps naturally onto the income/wealth distinction. \citet{hassoun2021sufficiency} develops a rigorous account of the sufficiency threshold based on what people need for autonomous functioning and minimally good lives. This threshold, while going beyond bare survival, falls short of full flourishing and is independently specifiable for policy guidance. Above this threshold, additional resources matter less morally—precisely the pattern observed empirically for wealth beyond security levels.

\citet{huseby2020sufficiency} refines this framework by proposing two separate thresholds: one marking where urgent needs are met, another where additional benefits become less morally important. This dual-threshold structure maps productively onto the income/wealth distinction. Income addresses ongoing consumption needs at and around the lower threshold, maintaining relatively high marginal utility for meeting basic requirements. Adequate assets address security at the upper threshold, but once this security function is satisfied, additional wealth serves primarily positional or bequest purposes with sharply diminished marginal utility.

The formal integration of sufficientarian and utilitarian axioms by \citet{bossert2021criticallevel} provides rigorous grounding for this differential treatment. Their "critical-level sufficientarianism" applies absolute priority below the threshold while using utilitarian principles as tie-breakers above it. This framework accommodates the empirical reality that both income and wealth matter urgently below sufficiency, but diverge above it: income continues addressing consumption with measurable marginal utility, while wealth increasingly serves functions with near-zero marginal welfare benefit.

\citet{kanschik2015sufficientarianism} adds a risk-based dimension particularly relevant to asset holdings. He argues that even above sufficiency, progressive obligations are justified because those closer to the threshold face greater risk of falling below it. This risk decreases with distance from threshold, justifying stronger obligations for those with greater security buffers. Applied to wealth, those with substantial assets face minimal risk of insufficiency—their marginal utility from additional assets approaches zero not only in consumption terms but in security terms as well. This risk-based reasoning directly supports progressive asset-based giving norms that increase with distance from security thresholds.

### Section Summary

Converging evidence establishes that assets beyond security thresholds exhibit systematically different marginal utility than income. Empirically, households accumulate wealth primarily for precautionary and bequest motives rather than consumption, with marginal propensities to consume as low as 2.3% for housing wealth. Theoretically, wealth increasingly serves positional functions where one person's gain implies another's relative loss, reducing marginal social utility below what standard diminishing returns predict. Philosophically, sufficientarian frameworks identify thresholds above which additional resources matter less morally, with risk-based arguments specifically supporting progressive obligations tied to asset levels. This asymmetry provides theoretical foundation for giving norms that treat accumulated wealth differently from ongoing income—a distinction absent from current frameworks like the 10% income pledge.
