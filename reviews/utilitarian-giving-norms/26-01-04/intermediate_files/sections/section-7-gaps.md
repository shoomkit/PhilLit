## Section 7: Research Gaps and Opportunities

The preceding analysis reveals that while each domain offers sophisticated treatments of related questions, significant gaps emerge at their intersection. These gaps collectively explain why the dominant income-based approach to philanthropic giving norms lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives, and they define the space within which the research project makes its contribution.

### 7.1 Absence of Systematic Comparison of Income vs. Asset Obligation Bases

The most striking gap spans the entire literature: despite extensive philosophical debate about *how much* one ought to give, there is remarkably little systematic analysis of *from what* giving obligations should be calculated. The demandingness literature extensively debates the stringency of beneficence requirements—whether \citet{singer1972famine} demands too much or \citet{murphy2000moral}'s cooperative principle appropriately limits obligations—but treats "resources" as an undifferentiated category. \citet{kagan1989limits} defends unlimited moral demands without specifying whether these apply to income flows, accumulated wealth, or both. Similarly, \citet{cullity2004moral}'s "life-altering demands" framework identifies when giving becomes supererogatory without distinguishing whether this threshold operates differently for income versus assets.

The effective altruism literature has converged on income-based norms through historical contingency rather than explicit justification. The Giving What We Can pledge operationalizes giving through income percentages, a structure \citet{macaskill2015doing} popularized without systematic argument for why income rather than wealth provides the appropriate base. \citet{aloyo2023effective} represents the most direct engagement with this question, raising the "net wealth objection" to fixed-percentage income norms. He argues that capacity-based giving better captures the reasons effective altruists give for charitable obligations, but does not develop a complete alternative framework specifying how assets should factor into obligation calculations.

This gap matters because without systematic comparison, we cannot determine whether dominant income-based norms actually optimize utilitarian objectives. If assets beyond security thresholds have lower marginal utility than income—as evidence from precautionary savings behavior \citep{horioka2020wealth, horioka2022retired} and positional goods theory \citep{shahar2017positional, walasek2017positional} suggests—current norms may substantially underutilize available philanthropic capacity. The research project directly addresses this gap by developing explicit criteria for comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions.

### 7.2 Disconnection Between Marginal Utility Theory and Philanthropic Norms

A second gap separates the empirical and theoretical literature on marginal utility from normative frameworks for philanthropic giving. Three distinct research programs support the claim that income and wealth exhibit different marginal utility profiles, yet none connects these findings to giving norm design.

The precautionary savings literature demonstrates that households accumulate wealth primarily for insurance and bequest purposes rather than consumption. \citet{horioka2020wealth} find that over 80% of retired Italian elderly engage in positive saving despite declining income needs, while \citet{painter2021housing} show that housing wealth operates primarily through precautionary motives with marginal propensity to consume of only 2.3%. These findings imply that wealth beyond security thresholds serves non-consumption functions with low marginal utility for the holder's welfare.

The positional goods literature provides complementary evidence. \citet{shahar2017positional} argues philosophically that wealth often functions as a relative rather than absolute good, diminishing its marginal contribution to welfare. \citet{walasek2017positional} demonstrate empirically that luxury brand consumption increases with inequality, suggesting wealth serves status-signaling purposes with low absolute welfare benefit. If much wealth accumulation beyond security thresholds serves positional rather than absolute welfare functions, its marginal utility is systematically lower than income used for direct consumption needs.

The sufficientarian literature introduces threshold concepts that could bridge these empirical findings with normative theory. \citet{hassoun2021sufficiency} develops practical accounts of sufficiency thresholds above which distribution matters less morally, while \citet{huseby2020sufficiency} proposes dual thresholds distinguishing urgent needs from security concerns. Yet these philosophical frameworks remain disconnected from precautionary wealth behavior and positional goods evidence.

The research project addresses this gap by synthesizing marginal utility evidence with utilitarian obligation theory. If marginal utility of assets beyond security thresholds is systematically lower than that of income, utilitarian theory may generate stronger obligations on assets than current income-based norms recognize. This synthesis requires integrating the economic evidence on wealth functions with the philosophical frameworks for specifying beneficence obligations.

### 7.3 Limited Application of Property and Limitarianism Theory to Voluntary Giving

A third gap concerns the relationship between property theory and voluntary giving norms. The philosophical literature offers sophisticated treatments of asset-based obligations in taxation contexts, but rarely extends these arguments to voluntary charitable norms.

\citet{murphy2002myth} fundamentally challenge the idea of pre-tax property rights, arguing that what individuals "deserve" can only be determined after specifying a legitimate tax system. This framework implies that both income and assets should be evaluated by their contribution to fair distribution rather than prior entitlements. \citet{robeyns2019extreme} develops limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings—grounded in both political equality concerns and the claim that surplus wealth above flourishing thresholds should address urgent unmet needs. \citet{halliday2018inheritance} demonstrates how wealth perpetuates intergenerational inequality in ways distinct from income, supporting special treatment of asset transfers.

Yet these arguments focus almost exclusively on taxation and mandatory redistribution rather than voluntary giving norms. \citet{pedersen2020distributive} examines income tax, wealth tax, and inheritance tax from multiple philosophical perspectives but does not address how these frameworks might inform voluntary charitable obligations. The extensive literature on property rights and duties of charity—including \citet{udi2015locke}'s reconciliation of Lockean property rights with enforceable distributive obligations—similarly focuses on what can be legally demanded rather than what individuals should voluntarily give.

This gap matters because if philosophical analysis supports treating assets distinctively for taxation purposes, parallel arguments may apply to voluntary giving. The considerations that justify progressive wealth taxation—accumulated assets represent lower marginal utility, contribute to political inequality, and perpetuate unearned advantage—could equally support asset-based charitable norms. The research project extends property and limitarianism frameworks to voluntary giving contexts, examining whether the same considerations that justify wealth taxation support asset-based charitable obligations.

### 7.4 Empirical Questions About Asset-Based Norm Feasibility

A fourth gap concerns the practical feasibility of asset-based giving norms. Even if such norms are theoretically justified, they may face implementation barriers that favor income-based alternatives as practical optima.

Behavioral research provides suggestive but incomplete evidence. \citet{drouvelis2019bonus} demonstrate that windfall income—which resembles drawing down assets—generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income, mediated by social norms about appropriate giving from different income sources. This suggests donors implicitly recognize differential marginal utility. However, no studies directly compare asset-based versus income-based commitment mechanisms.

The Giving Pledge represents the most prominent wealth-based commitment, yet \citet{schmitz2021billionaires} find its effectiveness difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and modest requirements. After a decade, actual follow-through rates remain unclear, contrasting with the growing participation data available for income-based pledges like Giving What We Can \citep{wilks2023who}. This asymmetry may reflect deeper challenges: income is more psychologically salient, easier to measure, and more amenable to social accountability than wealth \citep{caviola2021psychology}.

The meta-analytic evidence on social norms and charitable giving \citep{chapman2025social} shows moderate positive effects, with stronger impacts for injunctive norms (what one ought to do) than descriptive norms (what others do). This suggests that moral arguments for asset-based giving could influence behavior, but the finding that effects are strongest for close social referents implies that norm change may require grassroots movements rather than abstract philosophical arguments.

The research project addresses this gap by considering both theoretical justification and implementation feasibility. Even theoretically superior norms may face practical barriers—measurement difficulty, lower salience, weaker social accountability—that favor alternatives. The project identifies conditions under which asset-based norms would be preferable despite these challenges and develops strategies for addressing practical obstacles to their adoption.

### 7.5 Synthesis: The Research Opportunity

These four gaps collectively reveal that the dominant income-based approach to philanthropic giving norms represents a convergence of historical contingency, practical convenience, and theoretical inertia rather than systematic justification. The demandingness literature assumes undifferentiated "resources"; effective altruism operationalized through income without explicit argument; marginal utility research remains disconnected from normative frameworks; property and limitarianism theory focuses on taxation; and behavioral research lacks direct comparisons of income versus asset-based mechanisms.

The research project addresses this constellation of gaps by integrating marginal utility theory with utilitarian obligation frameworks, extending property and limitarianism philosophy to voluntary giving contexts, and evaluating both theoretical and practical considerations for asset-sensitive giving strategies. The central question—whether asset-based giving norms better capture utilitarian obligations than income-based alternatives—has been implicit in multiple literatures but never directly addressed. By making this question explicit and drawing on resources from each domain, the project occupies a distinctive and well-motivated position in the scholarly landscape.
