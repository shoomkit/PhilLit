## Section 1: Utilitarian Foundations and the Demandingness Challenge

Utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to aid those in need, yet the extensive literature on demandingness has focused almost exclusively on *whether* and *how much* to give rather than *from what resource base*. This omission is significant: if the abstract pool of "resources" admits of meaningful distinctions—particularly between income flows and accumulated assets—then the practical operationalization of utilitarian obligations may look quite different depending on which base we choose. This section establishes the theoretical landscape by examining both the case for strong obligations and the major strategies for moderating demand, attending throughout to how each position might apply differently to income versus assets.

### 1.1 The Case for Strong Obligations

The foundational argument for demanding beneficence appears in \citet{singer1972famine}, whose principle that we ought to prevent bad outcomes whenever we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance has structured subsequent debate. Singer's marginal utility framework—give until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to recipients—applies with equal formal validity to income and assets, yet its practical applications have overwhelmingly focused on income-based giving. This asymmetry lacks explicit justification in Singer's framework.

\citet{kagan1989limits} provides the most systematic defense of unlimited utilitarian demands, arguing that commonsense morality's limits on obligation rest on indefensible agent-centered prerogatives and constraints. On Kagan's view, consequentialism's demanding character is a feature rather than a bug, reflecting morality's genuine requirements. His rejection of principled limits on moral demands bears directly on whether utilitarian giving norms can accommodate personal wealth retention beyond bare necessities—a question that becomes increasingly pressing as one moves from income to accumulated assets.

\citet{unger1996living} complements these theoretical arguments with psychological evidence. Through a series of carefully constructed puzzles, Unger demonstrates that morally irrelevant factors—physical proximity, directness of causal connection, salience—systematically distort our judgments about obligations to aid distant strangers. When these distorting factors are removed, we recognize far more stringent obligations than conventional giving levels suggest. Notably, Unger's focus on psychological distortions may apply asymmetrically to income and assets: evolved hoarding instincts may distort intuitions about accumulated wealth more severely than about income flows.

This asymmetric application of debunking arguments receives indirect support from \citet{delazariradek2013demanding}, who argue that evolutionary explanations of self-interested bias undermine the rational foundation of objections to demanding requirements. If self-interested bias evolved to protect stored resources against competitors, we might expect intuitions about asset retention to be more evolutionarily distorted than intuitions about income disposition. The demandingness literature, however, has not systematically pursued this asymmetry, instead treating "resources" as an undifferentiated category.

### 1.2 Moderating Strategies and Their Limits

The major strategies for limiting utilitarian demands—agent-centered prerogatives, cooperative principles, and life-altering demands frameworks—each provide conceptual resources for moderating obligations, yet none has been systematically applied to distinguish income from asset obligations. This represents a significant gap, since each framework plausibly generates different conclusions when applied to these different resource bases.

\citet{scheffler1982rejection} proposes a hybrid theory incorporating an agent-centered prerogative allowing agents to give disproportionate weight to their own interests and projects. The prerogative is grounded in the independence and integrity of persons as distinct agents with their own perspectives. Crucially, if assets are more closely tied to long-term life plans and security than income flows, Scheffler's framework might permit greater retention of assets while requiring more stringent giving from income. Alternatively, if security beyond a threshold contributes little to personal projects, the framework might support stronger asset-based obligations.

\citet{murphy1993demands} and \citet{murphy2000moral} develop the cooperative principle, limiting individual obligations to a "fair share" of the collective good that would result if all agents complied. This directly addresses questions of percentage and amount, yet the framework's application remains ambiguous between income and assets. If fair share should track total capacity rather than annual flow, Murphy's framework would support asset-sensitive norms. The cooperative principle specifies what agents ought to do assuming full compliance, but leaves open whether compliance should be measured against income, wealth, or some combination.

\citet{cullity2004moral} seeks middle ground through the concept of "life-altering demands"—requirements that would fundamentally change one's life plan mark the boundary between obligation and supererogation. This framework directly engages with how giving affects agents' lives, yet generates potentially divergent conclusions for income and assets. For affluent individuals, asset depletion beyond a security threshold may be less life-altering than equivalent income reduction, since ongoing consumption depends primarily on income flows while assets serve insurance and positional functions. If so, Cullity's framework would support stronger obligations on assets than income.

\citet{portmore2011commonsense} develops commonsense consequentialism with a dual-ranking structure that preserves consequentialist concern for overall good while incorporating agent-relative value. This sophisticated framework could support differential treatment of income and assets if they enter differently into agent-relative versus impersonal value rankings—assets tied to security and long-term planning might carry more agent-relative value than current income, or might carry less if marginal security is low. The framework provides structure for the analysis but does not itself resolve the income-versus-assets question.

The literature on demandingness thus provides rich conceptual resources for specifying utilitarian obligations, yet has not applied these resources to the fundamental question of which resource base—income, assets, or some function of both—should ground practical giving norms. This gap is particularly striking given that the marginal utility considerations central to utilitarian theory plausibly apply differently to income and accumulated wealth. The following sections take up this gap directly.
