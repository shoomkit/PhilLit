## Conclusion

This review has traced the philosophical foundations and practical limitations of utilitarian giving norms, revealing a significant gap between theoretical sophistication and operational specification. From \citet{singer1972famine}'s foundational principle that we ought to prevent suffering when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to give. Yet the dominant operationalization of these obligations—the 10% income pledge championed by Giving What We Can and the effective altruism movement \citep{macaskill2015doing, macaskill2019definition}—lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives.

The convergence of evidence from multiple domains strengthens this critique. Empirical research on precautionary savings demonstrates that households accumulate wealth primarily for insurance and bequest purposes rather than consumption, with retired elderly continuing to save even as income declines \citep{horioka2020wealth}. The positional goods literature reveals that wealth beyond security thresholds functions largely as a relative good for status signaling, generating lower absolute marginal utility than income directed toward ongoing needs \citep{shahar2017positional, walasek2017positional}. Sufficientarian philosophy provides theoretical grounding for threshold effects: once basic security is achieved, additional resources matter less morally \citep{hassoun2021sufficiency}. Together, these strands converge on a crucial asymmetry: assets beyond security thresholds have systematically lower marginal utility than income flows directed toward current consumption.

This asymmetry has been largely overlooked in the demandingness debate. While philosophers have extensively analyzed whether utilitarian obligations are too demanding \citep{kagan1989limits, scheffler1982rejection, murphy2000moral, cullity2004moral}, and effective altruists have developed practical commitment mechanisms, neither tradition has systematically compared income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions. \citet{aloyo2023effective}'s critique of fixed-percentage giving begins to address this gap by proposing progressive giving based on capacity, but does not fully develop the theoretical case for wealth-sensitive frameworks.

The proposed research fills this gap by systematically comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms within a utilitarian framework. If the marginal utility asymmetry holds, the practical implications are significant: high-net-worth individuals may face substantially stronger obligations than income-based norms recognize, while middle-class donors with limited assets may appropriately face weaker demands on their income. This represents not merely a technical refinement but a potential reorientation of philanthropic norms—one that \citet{murphy2002myth} anticipated in noting that fair-share calculations must consider total resources, not merely income flows.

Several limitations warrant acknowledgment. The analysis proceeds within utilitarian assumptions and may not address justice-based concerns about the sources of wealth \citep{robeyns2019extreme}, virtue-based considerations about charitable disposition, or structural critiques emphasizing systemic change over individual giving \citep{berkey2018institutional}. The psychological feasibility of asset-based commitments—given that wealth is less salient and more emotionally fraught than income \citep{schubert2024mind}—also requires empirical investigation. Nevertheless, the theoretical case for examining asset-sensitive alternatives to prevailing income-based norms is compelling, and the potential for more defensible philanthropic frameworks makes this investigation urgent.
