## Section 6: Empirical Giving Behavior and Norm Feasibility

The theoretical case for asset-based giving norms must confront behavioral reality: how do donors actually respond to different income sources, and what psychological factors determine whether giving commitments translate into action? Empirical research reveals both support for the marginal utility asymmetry thesis and important implementation considerations that any viable giving norm must address.

### 6.1 Differential Treatment of Income Sources

A striking finding from behavioral economics directly supports the thesis that different income sources have different marginal utility profiles. \citet{drouvelis2019bonus} demonstrate through two experiments that bonus and windfall income generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income of equivalent amount. Crucially, this pattern is explained by social norms rather than individual preferences: a coordination game reveals that people believe morally appropriate donation levels depend on both the amount received and *whether it was earned or windfall*. This provides behavioral evidence that donors implicitly recognize the marginal utility asymmetry—regular income serving ongoing needs carries higher personal value than unexpected gains resembling asset accumulation.

This differential treatment connects to \citet{andreoni1990impure}'s foundational analysis of "warm-glow" giving. Andreoni's framework distinguishes pure altruism (caring about recipient welfare) from impure altruism (deriving personal satisfaction from the act of giving itself). The warm-glow component helps explain why regular income-based giving may generate more psychological satisfaction than less frequent asset-based contributions: habitual giving creates repeated opportunities for warm glow, while occasional large gifts from assets provide fewer such moments despite potentially greater impact.

Whether social norms can shift giving behavior is addressed by \citet{chapman2025social}'s meta-analysis of 113 samples (N=100,469 across 22 countries). The analysis finds a moderate positive relationship between social norms and charitable giving (r=.18), with injunctive norms (what one *ought* to do) outperforming descriptive norms (what most people *actually* do). This suggests that moral arguments about appropriate giving—whether from income or assets—matter more than information about what others give. The finding that effects are stronger for internalized norms and close social referents implies that norm change may require grassroots movement building rather than top-down pronouncements. However, the detection of publication bias counsels caution about overstating these effects.

### 6.2 Pledge Effectiveness and Implementation

The contrast between income-based and asset-based commitment mechanisms is illuminated by \citet{schmitz2021billionaires}'s analysis of the Giving Pledge's first decade. While the pledge attracted 211 billionaire signatories committing to give away at least half their wealth during lifetime or at death, its impact remains difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and vague timeline. The pledge letters reveal giving motivated by desires to "make a difference" and personal fulfillment, yet the absence of binding enforcement and measurable milestones contrasts sharply with the regular, accountable structure of income-based pledges like Giving What We Can's 10% commitment.

This implementation difference connects to a fundamental methodological concern raised by \citet{shang2019giving}. Using data from over 17,000 donors, they demonstrate that relationships between psychological factors and charitable giving are 3-8 times larger when modeling stated intentions than actual behavior. Strikingly, 27% of donors who expressed no intention to give nevertheless donated, revealing a substantial gap between expressed attitudes and action. For evaluating giving norms, this finding cautions against relying on survey evidence about willingness to adopt new commitments. The large intention-behavior gap suggests that binding, regular commitments with measurable compliance—features more readily achieved by income-based pledges—may prove more effective than aspirational wealth-based commitments with distant and flexible fulfillment horizons.

### 6.3 Psychological Barriers and Design Considerations

Designing effective giving norms requires understanding psychological heterogeneity among potential donors. \citet{yoon2024interactive} find through experiments (N=2,203) and a field study with alumni donations (N=22,468) that making incentives more salient increases prosocial behavior when prosocial motivation is low, but has no effect—or even negative effect—when motivation is already high. This interaction suggests that one-size-fits-all approaches may be suboptimal. Income-based norms emphasizing habit formation might work well for already-motivated donors, while asset-based norms requiring explicit incentive framing might better activate the less-motivated, though risking crowding out among committed givers.

Framing effects further complicate norm design. \citet{howe2021normative} demonstrate across six experiments that "working-together" appeals inviting people to "join in" and "do it together" significantly increased actual charitable donations, while equivalent normative-information appeals (same information, no collaboration framing) had no effect. The mechanism operates through fostering feelings of collective action that increase motivation while reducing perceived social pressure. This finding suggests asset-based norms may succeed better when framed as joining a collective movement ("Join the effective giving community in dedicating a portion of assets annually") rather than individual compliance with external expectations.

Finally, \citet{grossman2024self} decompose warm glow into self-image and social-image components, finding that social-image concerns increase donation amounts among those who choose to give but do not expand the donor pool, while self-image concerns affect both decisions. This distinction has direct implications for norm design: income-based norms with regular, visible giving create more opportunities for social recognition, potentially leveraging social-image concerns effectively. Asset-based norms, being less frequent and often private, may need to rely more heavily on self-image appeals—emphasizing moral identity and personal satisfaction from substantial impact.

### Section Summary

Behavioral evidence provides convergent support for the marginal utility asymmetry: donors treat windfall income as more available for giving, consistent with the thesis that accumulated resources beyond ongoing needs have lower personal marginal utility. However, the evidence also reveals significant implementation asymmetries. Income-based norms offer advantages in regularity, measurability, and social visibility that leverage warm glow and social-image concerns through repeated giving opportunities. Asset-based norms face challenges from the intention-behavior gap, measurement difficulties, and lower social salience. Addressing these challenges would require careful attention to framing (collective movement rather than individual compliance), commitment mechanisms (binding rather than aspirational), and psychological targeting (self-image appeals for high-motivation donors, explicit incentives for others). The empirical literature thus supports the theoretical case for asset-based obligations while identifying the practical design requirements such norms would need to meet.
