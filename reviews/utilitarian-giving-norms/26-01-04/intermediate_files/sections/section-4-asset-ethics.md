## Section 4: Asset Ethics, Property Rights, and Wealth Limits

The question of whether utilitarian giving obligations should track income or assets cannot be resolved without examining how different philosophical traditions treat accumulated wealth. Property rights theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism each provide distinctive resources for thinking about asset-based obligations, and their convergence on treating wealth differently from earned income provides substantial philosophical support for asset-sensitive giving norms.

### 4.1 Property Rights and Beneficence

A persistent objection to asset-based giving obligations holds that accumulated wealth represents legitimately acquired property over which owners have exclusive rights. This libertarian challenge dissolves, however, once we examine the conceptual foundations of property itself.

\citet{murphy2002myth} mount a fundamental challenge to pre-tax property rights, arguing that property entitlements can only be determined *after* specifying a legitimate system of distribution, including taxation. On their view, there is no fact about what one "deserves" prior to institutional specification—the very concept of pre-institutional property is mythical. This reframing removes libertarian barriers to asset-based obligations: if property rights are constituted by the legal and moral system rather than existing prior to it, then obligations on assets cannot violate natural rights that do not exist. The question becomes which obligation structure—income-based or asset-based—better achieves distributive justice goals, precisely the question the present research addresses.

Even within frameworks that grant robust pre-institutional property rights, asset-based obligations find support. \citet{udi2015locke} demonstrates that Lockean property theory, often invoked to resist redistribution, actually accommodates strong charitable obligations. Udi argues that for Locke, property rights and duties of charity both derive from a common source: the fundamental right to preservation. God's grant that each person has a right to the means of preservation simultaneously grounds property acquisition (individuals may appropriate what they need) and charitable obligations (others retain claims when their preservation is threatened). Property rights are thus not absolute but constrained by others' preservation needs from the outset. This convergence—a liberal egalitarian rejection of pre-institutional property and a Lockean reconciliation of property with charity—suggests that asset-based giving obligations are compatible with, rather than violations of, property rights theory across diverse frameworks.

### 4.2 Inheritance and Intergenerational Wealth

Assets function distinctively in perpetuating inequality across generations, providing additional grounds for treating them differently from income. \citet{halliday2018inheritance} argues that unrestricted inheritance is unjust because it perpetuates intergenerational inequality, creating what he terms "economic segregation" by concentrating opportunities within specific family lineages. Crucially, this concentration operates through assets rather than income: wealth compounds across generations through inheritance and investment, while income typically does not transfer intergenerationally. This asymmetry suggests that asset holdings create justice concerns distinct from those arising from income flows.

\citet{white2018moral} addresses the common objection that assets represent "double taxation"—that they are already after-tax income and should not face additional obligations. White systematically refutes this concern, arguing that what matters for justice is not the history of a resource's taxation but its current contribution to inequality and the opportunities it affords. The differential treatment of assets is justified by their effects on distribution, not by their tax history. \citet{pedersen2020distributive} extends this analysis by comparing income and wealth taxation on ability-to-pay grounds, arguing that wealth taxes better track true capacity to contribute than income taxes alone, while avoiding disincentive effects on labor. This framework applies directly to voluntary giving norms: if ability-to-pay considerations justify treating assets distinctively for taxation, parallel reasoning supports asset-sensitive philanthropic obligations.

The breadth of philosophical consensus here is striking. \citet{bird-pollan2017philosophical} examines wealth transfer taxation from utilitarian, Rawlsian, libertarian, and capabilities perspectives, finding that most major political philosophies support some form of distinctive treatment for wealth transfers. This convergence across frameworks that disagree about income taxation suggests something normatively distinctive about the status of accumulated assets.

### 4.3 Limitarianism and Upper Wealth Bounds

Limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings—provides philosophical grounding for asset-specific obligations that complements marginal utility arguments. \citet{robeyns2019extreme} introduces the framework, arguing that wealth beyond the threshold needed for flourishing should be redirected to address urgent unmet needs. This threshold corresponds closely to the "security threshold" central to the present research: the point beyond which additional assets serve primarily insurance and positional functions with diminishing marginal utility.

\citet{timmer2024limitarianism} refines the conceptual structure by distinguishing two interpretations of "excess" wealth. On the zero-value interpretation, resources above the threshold have no moral value for the holder; on the outweighed-value interpretation, they retain some value but are outweighed by others' claims. This distinction maps onto the marginal utility question: assets beyond security thresholds may have *low* rather than *zero* marginal utility, but this value is outweighed by the higher marginal utility others would derive from the same resources. \citet{timmer2018defending} addresses practical objections, arguing that targeting wealth above flourishing thresholds minimizes productivity costs while capturing resources with low utility to holders.

The limitarian position gains additional support from \citet{axelsen2020expressive}, who argue that extreme wealth is *expressively* unjust—it conveys the morally objectionable message that one's interests matter vastly more than others'. This adds a non-consequentialist dimension to asset-based obligations: beyond a certain threshold, asset retention is not merely inefficient but expresses a problematic stance toward others. \citet{kramm2020limits} demonstrate that these intuitions have deep historical roots, surveying proto-limitarian arguments from Plato through Mill and finding persistent philosophical concern with wealth limits across diverse traditions.

**Section Summary**: Property theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism converge on treating assets distinctively from income. Murphy and Nagel remove libertarian barriers by denying pre-institutional property rights; Udi shows that even robust property frameworks accommodate charitable obligations. The inheritance literature demonstrates that assets create distinctive intergenerational justice concerns. Limitarianism provides threshold-based frameworks that align with marginal utility analysis. This convergence provides philosophical support for asset-specific giving obligations, though these frameworks have focused on taxation and redistribution rather than voluntary giving norms—a gap the present research addresses.
