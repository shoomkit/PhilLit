## Introduction

In his foundational paper on global poverty, \citet{singer1972famine} articulates a deceptively simple principle: we ought to prevent bad outcomes when we can do so without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. This principle has generated decades of philosophical debate about the stringency of our obligations to distant strangers—what \citet{kagan1989limits} defends as unlimited moral demands and what \citet{scheffler1982rejection} seeks to moderate through agent-centered prerogatives. Yet a striking feature of Singer's original formulation has received insufficient attention: the principle specifies no particular resource base. It could apply with equal force to income, accumulated wealth, or total productive capacity.

This theoretical openness stands in tension with how effective altruism has operationalized utilitarian beneficence. The Giving What We Can pledge—committing donors to contribute at least 10% of lifetime income to effective charities—has become the paradigmatic expression of utilitarian giving norms \citep{macaskill2015doing}. As \citet{macaskill2019definition} emphasizes, effective altruism aims to use evidence and reason to benefit others as much as possible with "the resources in our possession." Yet the movement's practical conventions have converged on income-based metrics without systematic justification for this choice over asset-based alternatives. The 10% pledge echoes religious tithing traditions but adapts them to secular utilitarian ends, focusing on income flows while largely ignoring the stock of accumulated wealth.

This convergence on income-based norms may represent a significant theoretical gap. \citet{aloyo2023effective} challenges the 10% standard on multiple grounds, arguing that fixed-percentage income pledges are simultaneously too demanding for low earners and insufficiently demanding for the wealthy. His "net wealth" objection is particularly salient: giving norms should consider total resources, not just income flows. The marginal utility considerations that ground utilitarian beneficence may actually favor asset-sensitive giving strategies. Assets beyond a reasonable security threshold serve primarily insurance, optionality, and positional functions—purposes whose marginal utility arguably diminishes more rapidly than income directed toward ongoing consumption needs. If accumulated wealth above a certain threshold contributes less to donor welfare than equivalent income, utilitarian principles may demand more aggressive asset-based giving than current norms recognize.

This review examines whether marginal utility considerations support a shift from income-based to asset-sensitive giving norms within utilitarian frameworks. The analysis proceeds through seven domains: theoretical foundations of utilitarian beneficence, the marginal utility asymmetry between income and assets, existing philanthropic norms and their justifications, property rights and wealth taxation considerations, temporal dimensions of giving obligations, empirical feasibility constraints, and research gaps requiring further investigation. Throughout, the review maintains focus on a specific practical question: what resource base should utilitarian giving norms track, and what thresholds or progressive structures might better capture our obligations than fixed income percentages?
