## Section 3: Existing Philanthropic Norms and the EA Framework

Effective altruism represents the most sophisticated contemporary attempt to operationalize utilitarian giving obligations. Yet despite its theoretical flexibility, the movement has converged on income-based norms without systematic justification for this choice over asset-based alternatives. This section critically examines that convergence.

### 3.1 The 10% Pledge and Its Justification

The path from \citet{singer1972famine}'s abstract principle—give until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to recipients—to the Giving What We Can pledge's concrete 10% income target represents a remarkable philosophical journey. Singer's foundational argument specifies no particular resource base; it could apply equally to income flows or accumulated wealth. The principle concerns preventing bad outcomes without sacrificing anything of "comparable moral importance," a formulation that is theoretically neutral between income and assets.

\citet{macaskill2019definition} defines effective altruism as using "evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible" with "the resources in our possession." This definition is notably ecumenical—it neither mandates utilitarianism nor specifies which resources count. Assets are no less "in our possession" than income, yet EA's practical focus has centered almost exclusively on the latter. \citet{macaskill2015doing} popularized the 10% income pledge as an accessible commitment mechanism, establishing it as EA's primary gateway practice.

Empirical research has tracked who makes these commitments. \citet{wilks2023who} found that Giving What We Can pledgers display distinctive psychological profiles: expanded moral circles, higher need for cognition, and actively open-minded thinking. Yet this study necessarily tracks income pledgers specifically—we lack comparable data on those who might prefer asset-based commitment structures. The question of whether EA's income focus reflects principled choice or merely the availability of measurable metrics remains open.

### 3.2 The Progressive Giving Challenge

\citet{aloyo2023effective} offers the most direct challenge to income-based norms in EA literature. His critique of the 10% threshold rests on four objections: demandingness (10% is too burdensome for low earners), fairness (flat percentages ignore differential capacity), historical injustices (some wealth derives from colonial extraction), and crucially, net wealth. This final objection argues that giving norms should track total resources, not just income flows.

Aloyo's net wealth objection strikes at the heart of income-based conventions. A retiree with substantial assets but minimal income faces negligible obligations under income-based norms despite having considerable capacity to give. Conversely, a high earner with negative net worth (student loans, mortgage debt) faces demanding obligations despite precarious financial position. Aloyo proposes progressive giving scaled to genuine capacity, though he does not fully develop the theoretical case for asset-based calculations.

The psychological literature illuminates why EA converged on income despite theoretical neutrality. \citet{schubert2024mind} argue that effective altruism must work with human cognitive architecture rather than against it. Income is psychologically salient—it arrives regularly, is precisely measured, and is explicitly tracked for tax purposes. Wealth, by contrast, is harder to calculate, more emotionally fraught, and often tied to assets people perceive differently from income flows. \citet{caviola2021psychology} identify cognitive biases that impede effective giving; these barriers may be even more pronounced for wealth-based commitments, where illiquidity, valuation uncertainty, and stronger ownership intuitions complicate the picture.

This psychological analysis explains EA's practical convergence on income norms but does not establish that this convergence is justified. The fact that income-based pledges are psychologically easier does not make them philosophically correct if marginal utility considerations favor asset-based alternatives.

### 3.3 Institutional and Political Critiques

Major critiques of effective altruism bear indirectly on the income-assets question. \citet{gabriel2017critics} systematically evaluates three objections: the justice critique (EA neglects equality and rights), the methodological critique (quantification bias), and the systemic change critique (focus on symptoms over causes). The justice critique is particularly salient: if EA's utilitarian framework inadequately addresses distributive concerns, this limitation may extend to its treatment of income versus wealth. Income-based voluntary pledges leave existing wealth distributions untouched in ways that wealth-based obligations would not.

\citet{lechterman2020effective} argues that EA faces an unresolved tension between its depoliticized charitable approach and the inherently political nature of global poverty. Income-based voluntary pledges represent an individualist, market-friendly framework that sidesteps questions about collective obligations and structural reform. Asset-based obligations, by contrast, might require coordinated political action—wealth taxes, inheritance reform, or collective redistribution schemes that cannot be achieved through individual pledges alone.

\citet{dietz2019effective} presses this point through collective action analysis. Individual-level optimization may be self-defeating when coordinated group action would produce superior outcomes. Applied to giving norms, this suggests that voluntary income-based pledges—however well-intentioned—may be less effective than politically-mediated wealth redistribution. If EA's core commitment is to doing the most good, and if structural approaches outperform individual giving, EA's own principles would recommend systemic alternatives.

\citet{berkey2018institutional} defends EA against such critiques, arguing that the movement is theoretically compatible with institutional reform and would pursue systemic change if evidence supported its superiority. This defense implies that EA could accommodate asset-based approaches if they proved more effective. The question is not whether EA's principles permit wealth-based obligations—they clearly do—but whether its practical conventions have adequately considered this possibility.

**Section Summary**: EA's theoretical framework is genuinely ecumenical between income and asset bases for giving obligations. Yet the movement's practical convergence on income-based pledges reflects a combination of psychological convenience, measurability, and path dependence rather than principled argument. Neither EA's defenders nor its critics have systematically addressed whether assets warrant different treatment from income in determining philanthropic obligations.
