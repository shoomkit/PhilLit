## Section 5: Temporal Considerations and Patient Philanthropy

The preceding analysis of income versus asset-based giving norms has implicitly assumed that philanthropic resources should be deployed relatively promptly. Yet a growing literature on patient philanthropy challenges this assumption, arguing that optimal timing may involve substantial delay between resource accumulation and disbursement. This section examines how decision-theoretic considerations about giving timing interact with the income/assets question.

### 5.1 The Case for Patient Philanthropy

\citet{trammell2020discounting} demonstrates that philanthropists who weight future welfare equally with present welfare should remove pure time preference from their discount rate calculations. Under historical investment return assumptions of 4-7% and philanthropic discount rates of only 0.5-2%, this framework implies that patient philanthropists could justify saving resources for decades or even centuries before deployment. This finding directly challenges the implicit assumption underlying income-based giving norms—that resources should be disbursed contemporaneously with earning.

The implications deepen when we consider heterogeneous donor populations. \citet{trammell2021dynamic} models optimal philanthropic timing when funders have different discount rates, proving that more patient funders should invest entirely while impatient funders spend. This coordination dynamic suggests that optimal giving norms may differ across individuals based on time preferences, complicating universal prescriptions like the 10% income pledge. \citet{greaves2021longtermism} extend this framework further, arguing that if influencing the far future through existential risk reduction dominates near-term charitable opportunities, resources might optimally be accumulated for civilizational trajectory changes rather than immediate poverty alleviation.

These arguments might seem to favor asset-based norms, since patient philanthropy involves accumulating resources through investment. However, the relationship is not straightforward. As \citet{madoff2023giving} observe in their comprehensive treatment of temporal dimensions in philanthropy, patient philanthropy addresses *when* to give but leaves open the question of *from what base* to calculate obligations when giving does occur. A philanthropist practicing patient accumulation must still determine whether eventual disbursements should track historical income, current assets, or some other measure.

### 5.2 Uncertainty and Decision-Theoretic Limits

The sophisticated expected-value reasoning underlying patient philanthropy faces significant challenges. \citet{mogensen2020maximal} argues that "cluelessness"—our inability to predict the long-run consequences of our actions—combined with permissive decision rules for deep uncertainty undermines confident cause prioritization. If we cannot reliably assess whether patient investment or immediate disbursement produces better long-term outcomes, the case for complex timing optimization weakens. This might favor simpler heuristics, but crucially, the uncertainty cuts both ways: cluelessness does not obviously favor income-based over asset-based norms or vice versa.

\citet{lim2019effectiveness} presses a related ecumenicity critique, arguing that different moral frameworks and risk attitudes may justify diverse giving patterns. If individuals may reasonably support various philanthropic approaches based on different values and evidential standards, this supports pluralism about giving norms rather than any single optimal formula—whether income-based, asset-based, or temporally sophisticated. \citet{lucas2023reflections} reinforces these concerns from financial economics, demonstrating that standard discounting methods become unreliable for very long time horizons due to deep uncertainty about projections and the inadequacy of present value as a measure of value. This suggests that both patient philanthropy's case for delay and immediate giving's case for urgency face decision-theoretic challenges that resist confident resolution.

In sum, temporal considerations complicate but do not resolve the income/assets question. Patient philanthropy might justify asset accumulation, while uncertainty might favor simpler norms, but neither line of argument clearly privileges income-based over asset-based approaches to calculating philanthropic obligations.
