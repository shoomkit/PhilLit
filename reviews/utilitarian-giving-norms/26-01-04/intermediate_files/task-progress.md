# Literature Review Progress Tracker

**Research Topic**: Utilitarian obligations to give - income vs. asset-based giving norms
**Started**: 2026-01-04
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04

## Research Questions

**Broad**: Many forms of utilitarianism entail an obligation to donate to charity. How should the utilitarian obligation to give be implemented in practice?

**Fine-grained**: Are utilitarian obligations to give to charity better captured by giving norms based on income or by giving norms based on net assets?

## Progress Status

- [x] Phase 1: Verify environment and determine execution mode
- [x] Phase 2: Structure literature review domains
- [x] Phase 3: Research 6 domains in parallel
- [ ] Phase 4: Outline synthesis review across domains
- [ ] Phase 5: Write review for each section in parallel
- [ ] Phase 6: Assemble final review files and move intermediate files

## Completed Tasks

2026-01-04 Phase 1: Environment verified, working directory created
2026-01-04 Phase 2: Created lit-review-plan.md (6 domains)
