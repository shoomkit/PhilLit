DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers psychological and economic research on how people actually
give to charity, including the motivational factors, behavioral patterns, and
contextual influences on charitable donations. The literature reveals several
key findings: (1) Giving is motivated by a complex mix of pure altruism, warm-glow
(intrinsic satisfaction from giving), and social signaling; (2) Income and wealth
have distinct effects on giving, with evidence that windfall income is donated
at higher rates than earned income; (3) Social norms significantly influence
giving behavior, with both descriptive and injunctive norms playing roles;
(4) Pledges and commitments show mixed effectiveness - while high-profile
initiatives like the Giving Pledge have inspired billionaire philanthropy,
actual follow-through rates are modest; (5) The relationship between giving
intention and actual giving behavior is weaker than often assumed, with effect
sizes for behavioral outcomes being 3-8 times smaller than for stated intentions.

Recent experimental work has refined our understanding of warm glow versus
pure altruism through novel elicitation methods, showing that most donors
exhibit "impure altruism" - caring about both recipient welfare and their
own satisfaction from giving. Field experiments demonstrate that framing effects,
matching incentives, and social context significantly influence donation amounts
and frequency. Cross-cultural research reveals that giving patterns vary
substantially based on cultural tightness-looseness, religious context, and
prevailing social norms about appropriate donation targets.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This empirical literature directly addresses the research question about income
versus wealth-based giving norms. Studies on windfall income effects, warm glow,
and the marginal utility of different income sources provide behavioral evidence
for how donors actually respond to changes in income and wealth. The finding
that bonus/windfall income generates higher donation rates than earned income
supports the theoretical asymmetry proposed in the research idea. Additionally,
research on pledges and commitments is directly relevant to evaluating the
10% income pledge versus asset-based approaches.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Few studies directly compare giving behavior from income versus accumulated
wealth/assets. Most empirical work focuses on income effects or wealth effects
separately, without systematic comparison. Limited research on how donors
conceptualize the marginal utility of income versus assets in their giving
decisions. Need for longitudinal studies tracking how giving responds to
wealth accumulation beyond security thresholds.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
When synthesizing this literature, emphasize the behavioral evidence for
differential treatment of income versus windfall/wealth. Connect warm glow
findings to questions about intrinsic versus instrumental motivations for
meeting giving norms. Use pledge effectiveness research to evaluate claims
about income-based commitments like the 10% pledge. Consider how social
norm research illuminates the feasibility of shifting from income-based to
asset-based giving norms.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Warm glow / impure altruism: 6 papers - Giving motivated by intrinsic satisfaction alongside altruistic concern
- Social norms influence: 5 papers - Both descriptive and injunctive norms shape donation behavior
- Income/wealth effects: 4 papers - Differential responses to earned income, windfall income, and wealth
- Pledge effectiveness: 3 papers - Mixed evidence on commitment mechanisms for sustained giving

  doi = {10.2307/2234133},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Andreoni introduces the concept of "warm glow" to explain charitable giving, arguing that donors derive utility both from the public good their donation provides (pure altruism) and from the act of giving itself (impure altruism). This model predicts incomplete crowding out of private donations by government provision, which pure altruism models cannot explain. The warm-glow component represents the personal satisfaction, moral fulfillment, or positive self-image donors receive from their contribution, independent of the donation's impact.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper is essential for understanding the motivational complexity behind charitable giving. For the research project's comparison of income versus asset-based norms, warm glow suggests that donors may respond differently to giving requirements based on whether they perceive the obligation as intrinsically satisfying or externally imposed. The distinction between pure and impure altruism helps explain why income-based norms (regular, visible giving) might generate more warm glow than asset-based norms (less frequent, less visible transfers).

  POSITION: Foundational behavioral economics paper establishing the "impure altruism" framework that has become standard in empirical studies of charitable giving.

  doi = {10.1002/per.2256},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This study applies Moral Foundations Theory to charitable giving, finding that stronger individualizing moral intuitions (fairness and harm prevention) predict greater willingness to donate and larger donation amounts, while binding intuitions (loyalty, authority, sanctity) predict allocation toward in-group causes. Importantly, moral foundations predicted giving beyond political ideology, religiosity, and demographics, suggesting they tap into distinct psychological drivers of prosocial behavior.

  RELEVANCE: This research illuminates how different moral frameworks shape giving patterns, which is directly relevant to understanding who might be responsive to income-based versus asset-based giving norms. If individualizing foundations predict concern for distant others, these individuals might be more receptive to consequentialist arguments about effective giving from accumulated assets. The finding that moral foundations operate independently of demographics suggests that norm-setting for charitable obligations should consider psychological heterogeneity, not just economic capacity.

  POSITION: Integrates moral psychology with behavioral philanthropy research, showing that deep-seated moral intuitions shape giving patterns in ways that cross-cut standard demographic and ideological categories.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzing the first decade of the Giving Pledge (created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett), this study finds that while the pledge has attracted 211 billionaire signatories, its impact remains difficult to assess due to its voluntary nature and modest commitment goal (giving away at least half of wealth during lifetime or at death). The pledge letters reveal education and health as dominant causes, with giving motivated by desires to make a difference, give back, personal fulfillment, and early socialization into philanthropy. The population is dominated by white, male, US-based billionaires, with tech billionaires forming a wealthier and younger subgroup.

  RELEVANCE: This empirical analysis of the Giving Pledge is directly relevant to evaluating income-based versus wealth-based giving norms. The pledge represents a high-profile wealth-based (rather than income-based) commitment, yet its lack of binding enforcement and vague timeline illustrate key challenges with asset-based norms. The finding that actual follow-through is difficult to assess suggests that wealth-based pledges may lack the regularity and accountability that characterize income-based norms like the 10% pledge. The demographic concentration also raises questions about the universalizability of asset-based giving norms.

  POSITION: Empirical study of elite philanthropy showing that while wealth-based pledges can inspire high-profile commitments, their practical effectiveness for ensuring sustained, accountable giving remains uncertain.

  number = {5},
  pages = {1023--1044},
  doi = {10.1177/0899764019843340},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Using data from over 17,000 donors across five charities, this study demonstrates that the relationships between satisfaction, trust, commitment and charitable giving are 3-8 times larger when modeling giving intentions than when modeling actual giving behavior. Critically, 27% of donors who stated no intention to give actually donated, revealing a substantial gap between expressed attitudes and behavior. At the individual level, all group-level relationships between psychological factors and intentions replicate for behavior, but with dramatically smaller effect sizes.

  RELEVANCE: This finding has profound implications for evaluating giving norms and pledges. Much research on charitable giving relies on stated intentions rather than actual behavior, potentially overstating the effectiveness of norm-based interventions. For the income versus asset debate, this suggests we should be skeptical of survey evidence about willingness to adopt different giving norms, and instead focus on behavioral studies. The large intention-behavior gap also suggests that binding commitments (as in income-based norms with regular, visible giving) may be more effective than aspirational pledges (as in many wealth-based commitments).

  POSITION: Methodological critique showing that giving intention and giving behavior are far more distinct than typically assumed, with critical implications for evaluating interventions and norms in charitable giving.

  volume = {182},
  pages = {104080},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jpubeco.2019.104080},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Through two experiments, this study shows that bonus/windfall income generates significantly higher charitable donations than earned income of equal amount, and that this pattern can be explained by social norms. A coordination game reveals that people believe morally appropriate donation levels depend on both the amount received and whether it was earned or windfall. The norms elicited in the coordination game match actual donation patterns across demographics, providing strong evidence that social norms drive differential treatment of income sources.

  RELEVANCE: This finding is central to the research project's thesis about asymmetric marginal utility of income versus assets. If windfall income (which resembles drawing down assets) generates higher donation rates than earned income, this provides behavioral evidence that donors implicitly recognize that different income sources have different marginal utility. This supports the argument that giving norms should account for the source of funds - regular income serves ongoing needs (high marginal utility) while accumulated assets beyond security thresholds serve lower-utility purposes (insurance, optionality, status), making asset-based giving more appropriate.

  POSITION: Experimental evidence showing that income source matters for giving behavior in ways consistent with differential marginal utility, mediated by social norms about appropriate donation levels.

  doi = {10.1177/01461672251383996},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This multilevel meta-analysis of 113 independent samples (N=100,469 across 22 countries) finds a moderate positive relationship between social norms and charitable giving (r=.18). The effect is stronger for injunctive norms (what one ought to do) than descriptive norms (what most people do), when the referent is friends/family versus anonymous others, for internalized versus externally presented norms, and when giving is observed by others. Effects were particularly strong for younger people and in non-WEIRD and collectivist contexts, but were only found in published (not preregistered) studies, suggesting publication bias.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive meta-analysis establishes that social norms significantly influence charitable giving, which is crucial for evaluating the feasibility of shifting from income-based to asset-based giving norms. The finding that injunctive norms (oughtness) outperform descriptive norms suggests that moral arguments about what donors should give (whether from income or assets) matter more than what others actually give. The stronger effects for close social referents implies that norm change might require grassroots movement rather than top-down policy. The publication bias finding counsels caution about overstating norm effects.

  pages = {390--404},
  doi = {10.1177/09567976241234560},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Three experiments (N=2,203) and a field study with alumni donations (N=22,468) show that making incentives for charitable giving more salient increases prosocial behavior when prosocial motivation is low, but has no effect (or negative effect) when prosocial motivation is high. The mechanism is that salient incentives increase consideration of self-interested benefits, which drives behavior for those low in prosocial motivation but can undermine intrinsic motivation for those high in prosocial motivation. This demonstrates heterogeneous treatment effects based on underlying motivation.

  RELEVANCE: This research has important implications for designing giving norms and incentives. If the goal is to encourage giving from those not already motivated by altruism, highlighting personal benefits (tax deductions, social recognition, warm glow) may be effective. However, for highly prosocial individuals, emphasizing such incentives could backfire by crowding out intrinsic motivation. This suggests that income-based versus asset-based norms might appeal to different donor populations - income norms may work better for habit formation among the already-motivated, while asset-based norms with clear incentives might activate the less-motivated.

  POSITION: Controlled experiments revealing that the effectiveness of incentive framing depends critically on donors' underlying prosocial motivation, suggesting one-size-fits-all approaches to promoting giving may be suboptimal.

  number = {12},
  pages = {eade7987},
  doi = {10.1126/sciadv.ade7987},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This study introduces two interventions to increase effective charitable giving: (1) donation bundling - allowing donors to split donations between their preferred charity and an expert-recommended highly effective charity, which increased effective donations by 76%; (2) micromatching - offering increasing match rates for allocating more to the effective charity, which provided an additional 55% boost. These techniques were implemented in GivingMultiplier.org, which fundraised over $1.5 million in 14 months. The research shifts focus from quantity of giving to effectiveness of giving.

  RELEVANCE: This research demonstrates that donors can be nudged toward more effective giving without completely abandoning their personal preferences, which is relevant for promoting asset-based giving norms. If donors are attached to regular income-based giving (which may serve personal/emotional needs), bundling approaches could encourage additional asset-based giving to effective causes. The success of micromatching also suggests that graduated incentives (e.g., recognition tiers for asset-based giving) could increase uptake. The platform's success shows that relatively modest interventions can substantially impact giving patterns.

  POSITION: Applied behavioral research showing that carefully designed choice architecture can substantially increase effective charitable giving while respecting donor autonomy and personal preferences.

  doi = {10.1037/pspa0000278},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Across six experiments, "working-together" normative appeals that invited people to "join in" and "do it together" significantly increased charitable giving and other prosocial behaviors, while normative-information appeals (same information, no collaboration framing) had no effect. Mediation analyses show working-together appeals foster a feeling of collective action that increases motivation while reducing perceived social pressure. Effects held for actual charitable donations, not just intentions, and generalized across public goods (carbon reduction, paper towel use).

  RELEVANCE: This finding suggests that the framing of giving norms matters as much as their content. If asset-based giving norms are framed as a collective movement toward a common goal (e.g., "Join the effective giving community in dedicating 1% of assets annually"), they may be more effective than purely individualistic framing. The reduction in social pressure when collaboration is emphasized could address concerns that giving norms are coercive. This also suggests that grassroots movements for asset-based giving could be more successful than top-down mandates.

  doi = {10.1007/s40881-024-00170-w},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This paper introduces a novel method for eliciting the strength of altruistic motivation (ranging from pure warm glow to pure altruism) by combining a giving-type elicitation task with a Cobb-Douglas impure altruism utility function. This allows researchers to uniquely identify where donors fall on the altruism spectrum, which is critical because "impure altruists" (caring about both recipient welfare and personal satisfaction) form the largest donor category but are hardest to characterize. The method is compared with an alternative survey-based approach.

  RELEVANCE: Understanding the distribution of altruistic types in the donor population is crucial for designing effective giving norms. If most donors are impure altruists (as suggested), then both income-based and asset-based norms need to account for both the instrumental impact of donations and the expressive/identity benefits to donors. Pure asset-based norms focused solely on effective impact might fail to generate warm glow, while pure income-based norms focused on regular habit formation might not maximize impact. This research provides tools to measure which considerations matter most to different donor segments.

  POSITION: Methodological innovation enabling fine-grained measurement of altruistic motivation types, essential for matching giving interventions to donor psychology.

  doi = {10.1111/jpet.12393},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This theoretical paper extends models of charitable giving to incorporate income heterogeneity and distrust in institutions. It compares four models: public goods philanthropy (caring about total provision), warm-glow philanthropy (caring about act of giving), impact philanthropy (caring about personal contribution), and socially-motivated philanthropy (considering both trust and ability-to-pay). The socially-motivated model uniquely predicts a U-shaped pattern of giving (low-income and high-income give more than middle-income), which is frequently observed empirically but not explained by standard models.

  RELEVANCE: This theoretical framework helps explain heterogeneous giving patterns that are relevant to evaluating income versus asset-based norms. The U-shaped pattern suggests that middle-income individuals (for whom ability-to-pay is moderate and trust concerns are highest) may be least responsive to giving norms of any kind. The socially-motivated model's incorporation of ability-to-pay directly addresses the research project's concern with matching giving obligations to capacity. The trust dimension also suggests that asset-based norms may face additional resistance if donors distrust institutional measurement of wealth.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Four experiments (N=2,203) tested whether philosophical arguments or narratives are more effective at increasing charitable giving. Both narrative and argument conditions increased positive attitudes toward giving and actual donations ($1 more than control), with effects mediated by "narrative transportation" (emotional engagement, imagery, interest). This suggests that appeals work when they engage emotions and interest, regardless of whether they use philosophical reasoning or storytelling. The similar effectiveness of both approaches is surprising given philosophical skepticism about argument's motivational force.

  RELEVANCE: This research illuminates how to communicate about giving norms effectively. The finding that philosophical arguments can be as motivating as narratives (when both engage emotions) suggests that rational arguments for asset-based giving need not be cold and abstract - they can incorporate emotionally engaging elements. The mediation by narrative transportation suggests that effective advocacy for new giving norms (whether income or asset-based) must engage donors' imagination and emotional investment, not just present logical arguments.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This field experiment tests whether charitable appeals emphasizing donor benefits (e.g., "help yourself by helping others") or recipient benefits (e.g., "help others") are more effective. Results show that appeals emphasizing donor benefits (particularly social benefits and warm glow) significantly increased donations, while recipient-focused appeals had weaker effects. This suggests that fundraising is more effective when it aligns with donors' self-interested motivations rather than purely altruistic ones, supporting the impure altruism framework.

  RELEVANCE: This finding has implications for how giving norms are framed and communicated. If donor-focused benefits (social recognition, warm glow, moral satisfaction) drive giving more than impact on recipients, then both income-based and asset-based norms should emphasize these donor benefits. However, this creates tension with effective altruism principles that prioritize impact. The research suggests that purely consequentialist framing of asset-based norms (e.g., "your assets can save more lives") may be less effective than emphasizing personal fulfillment and social recognition from asset-based giving.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Applying the mechanisms of altruism (MOA) approach to blood donation, this review argues that while blood donation as a behavior is altruistic, the motivation may not be pure altruism. Congruency between self-reported motivations and behavioral indices from economic games reveals that blood donation reflects a mixture of warm-glow giving (emotional reward from donating) and reluctant altruism (cooperation despite free-riding temptations) rather than pure concern for recipients. The MOA framework integrates insights from biology, economics, and psychology to characterize donor motivations.

  RELEVANCE: Although focused on blood donation, this framework applies to charitable giving generally and illustrates the importance of distinguishing behavioral versus motivational altruism. For evaluating giving norms, this suggests we should not assume that altruistic behavior implies altruistic motivation - donors may comply with income-based or asset-based norms for various self-interested reasons (habit, social pressure, warm glow) rather than pure concern for recipients. This has implications for which norms will be sustained: those that provide multiple sources of motivation (impact, warm glow, social approval) may be more durable than those relying on pure altruism.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: An online experiment (N=960) with realistic simulation of being watched distinguishes self-image from social-image concerns in warm-glow giving. Results show that social image concerns do not increase the likelihood of giving but do increase the amount given when donors choose to give. Self-image concerns affect both the decision to give and the amount. This suggests that charities seeking to expand their donor base should focus on self-image appeals, while those seeking larger donations from existing donors should leverage social-image concerns.

  RELEVANCE: This decomposition of warm glow into self and social components is relevant for designing giving norms. Income-based norms may be more effective at leveraging social-image concerns because regular, visible giving creates more opportunities for social recognition. Asset-based giving, being less frequent and often private, may need to rely more on self-image appeals (moral satisfaction, identity as an effective giver). The finding that social image affects amount but not participation suggests that public recognition programs (e.g., Giving Pledge publicity) may increase giving levels among those already committed without expanding the donor pool.

  doi = {10.1016/j.joep.2018.08.009},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This experiment isolates motivational crowding out in charitable giving by controlling for strategic considerations. When donors face an unexpected ex post reimbursement (reducing the effective price of giving), donors with high intrinsic motivation substantially decrease subsequent donations compared to those with low intrinsic motivation who did not face the price change. This demonstrates that external interventions can undermine intrinsic motivation to give, particularly among the already-motivated, supporting Frey and Jegen's crowding-out hypothesis.

  RELEVANCE: This finding cautions against assuming that incentives and external pressures always increase giving. If asset-based giving norms are imposed through regulations or strong social pressure, they may crowd out the intrinsic motivation of those already giving generously from income. Conversely, voluntary income-based pledges may sustain intrinsic motivation better by allowing donors to maintain a sense of autonomy. This suggests that the design of giving norms matters as much as their content - coercive or manipulative norms may backfire by undermining the very motivations they seek to harness.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This study provides field evidence that offering extrinsic incentives for charitable giving can demotivate donors and reduce overall donations through motivation crowding out. When a charity introduced rebate incentives for donations, overall giving decreased because the incentives signaled that giving was motivated by self-interest rather than altruism, undermining donors' intrinsic motivation and self-image as altruistic. The effect was strongest for donors who previously gave frequently and in large amounts, suggesting that incentives particularly backfire with already-motivated donors.

  RELEVANCE: This field evidence for crowding out complements the experimental findings and has direct implications for incentive design around giving norms. Tax deductions, matching funds, and social recognition programs (whether for income-based or asset-based giving) may undermine intrinsic motivation for some donors. This suggests that giving norms should be framed primarily in moral terms (what one ought to do) rather than incentive terms (what one benefits from doing), particularly when targeting already-generous donors. The finding that frequent givers are most affected also suggests that habitual income-based giving may be particularly vulnerable to crowding out from explicit incentives.

  POSITION: Field study demonstrating that extrinsic incentives can backfire in charitable giving by crowding out intrinsic motivation, with strongest effects on already-motivated donors.

  CORE ARGUMENT: This cross-cultural study investigates how cultural tightness (strong norms and low tolerance for deviance, as in Korea) versus looseness (weak norms and high tolerance, as in the US) affects charitable giving responses to social norms and observation. People from tight cultures are more likely to comply with donation requests and are less affected by whether others are present (they donate based on internalized norms), while those from loose cultures are more influenced by social observation (they donate more when watched but rely less on internal norms).

  RELEVANCE: This research has implications for the cross-cultural applicability of giving norms. Income-based norms that rely on regular, visible compliance may be more effective in tight cultures where internalized norms drive behavior, while asset-based norms requiring less frequent, less visible giving may face challenges. However, in loose cultures, asset-based norms might need stronger social enforcement (public disclosure, social recognition) to compensate for weaker internalized norm adherence. This suggests that optimal giving norms may vary across cultural contexts, with no universal solution.

  POSITION: Cross-cultural research showing that the effectiveness of social norms and social context in charitable giving depends on broader cultural variation in norm strength (tightness-looseness).
