====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain addresses the normative foundations of wealth accumulation, retention, and transfer. Three central debates structure this literature: (1) the tension between property rights and obligations of beneficence, particularly whether absolute property rights can be reconciled with duties to aid those in need; (2) the moral status of inheritance and intergenerational wealth transfer, including questions about whether unearned advantage violates principles of equal opportunity or desert; and (3) emerging debates about limitarianism—the view that there are upper limits to permissible wealth holdings. Recent work has moved beyond traditional libertarian vs. egalitarian framings to explore how wealth concentration affects democratic equality (Halliday 2018, Robeyns 2019), how taxation relates to distributive justice (Murphy & Nagel 2002, Pedersen 2020), and whether property rights themselves presuppose duties of charity (Udi 2015). The domain reveals a systematic asymmetry: while income taxation is extensively theorized, asset-based obligations receive comparatively less attention, despite assets constituting the primary locus of wealth inequality.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question by examining the moral status of holding assets versus earning income. The literature on property rights and beneficence explores whether asset holdings generate obligations distinct from income-based duties. Halliday's work on inheritance demonstrates how assets perpetuate inequality across generations in ways income does not. The limitarianism literature provides philosophical grounding for threshold-based approaches to wealth limits, relevant to determining whether asset-based norms might capture utilitarian obligations more effectively than income-based pledges. Murphy & Nagel's challenge to pre-tax property rights reframes the entire debate about what wealth individuals are entitled to retain before obligations to others arise.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
The literature largely treats assets and income as fungible from a moral perspective, rarely examining whether their different marginal utilities warrant different normative treatment. Most work focuses on justifying redistribution of existing wealth rather than on comparing income-based vs. asset-based frameworks for determining charitable obligations. The intersection of marginal utility theory and wealth ethics remains underexplored, particularly regarding how diminishing returns on asset accumulation might justify asset-specific obligations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Pay particular attention to how property rights theories accommodate duties of beneficence (Udi 2015, Locke scholarship). Consider whether the limitarianism literature's focus on upper bounds complements or conflicts with the research project's focus on marginal utility. Examine how inheritance taxation arguments (Halliday, White, Pedersen) might inform broader asset-based obligation frameworks. The Murphy & Nagel framework may provide conceptual tools for rethinking pre-obligation entitlements.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Libertarian Property Rights: 3 papers - Absolute property rights with minimal taxation
- Liberal Egalitarian Redistribution: 6 papers - Taxation justified by distributive justice principles
- Limitarianism: 4 papers - Upper limits on permissible wealth holdings
- Asset-Specific Justice: 5 papers - Inheritance and wealth transfer as distinct moral problems

@book{murphy2002myth,
  author = {Murphy, Liam and Nagel, Thomas},
  title = {The Myth of Ownership: Taxes and Justice},
  year = {2002},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/0195150163.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the idea that individuals have pre-tax property rights, arguing instead that property rights are constituted by the legal system including tax law, hence taxation cannot violate natural property rights. The book develops a political theory of taxation grounded in considerations of fairness and the collective nature of economic productivity, arguing that what one "deserves" or is "entitled to" can only be determined after specifying a legitimate tax system.

  RELEVANCE: Fundamentally reframes the research question by denying that there are pre-obligation property rights in either income or assets. If Murphy and Nagel are correct, the distinction between income-based and asset-based charitable obligations may need to be grounded in their respective effects on utility or fairness rather than in prior entitlements. Their framework suggests examining which taxation/obligation base (income vs. assets) better achieves distributive justice goals, which aligns with the project's utilitarian approach.

  POSITION: Represents a liberal egalitarian rejection of libertarian property rights theory, with major implications for how we think about baseline entitlements before charitable obligations arise.

  title = {The Inheritance of Wealth: Justice, Equality, and the Right to Bequeath},
  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198803355.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that unrestricted inheritance is unjust because it perpetuates intergenerational inequality by concentrating opportunities within specific family lineages and social groups, creating "economic segregation." Halliday defends inheritance taxation not primarily to fund redistribution but to prevent the replication of class hierarchy across generations. The work synthesizes luck egalitarian concerns about unearned advantage with social egalitarian worries about group-based stratification.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses asset-specific moral considerations by demonstrating how wealth (particularly inherited wealth) creates obligations and injustices distinct from those arising from income. The focus on intergenerational wealth transfer highlights how assets function differently from income in perpetuating inequality—assets compound across generations while income typically does not. This supports examining whether asset-based charitable norms might better capture certain utilitarian obligations than income-based ones, particularly regarding long-term inequality prevention.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian position combining luck egalitarianism and social egalitarianism, with specific focus on assets as distinct moral category requiring special treatment beyond general income taxation.

  title = {What, if Anything, is Wrong with Extreme Wealth?},
  journal = {Journal of Human Development and Capabilities},
  year = {2019},
  volume = {20},
  pages = {251--266},
  doi = {10.1080/19452829.2019.1633734},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces "limitarianism"—the view that there are upper limits to how much wealth individuals should permissibly hold. Robeyns provides two main arguments: (1) extreme wealth undermines political equality by granting the superrich disproportionate political influence, and (2) surplus wealth above the threshold needed for flourishing should be redirected to address urgent unmet needs and collective action problems like climate change. The threshold is set where additional wealth no longer contributes to the holder's flourishing.

  RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to the research project's focus on marginal utility of assets. Robeyns's threshold corresponds closely to the "security threshold" beyond which marginal utility of assets is low. Her framework provides philosophical grounding for asset-specific upper limits based on diminishing marginal returns to flourishing. However, the project examines a different question: not whether wealth above a threshold should be redistributed, but whether obligations to give should be calculated based on assets rather than income given their different marginal utility profiles.

  POSITION: Establishes limitarianism as a distinct position in distributive justice focused specifically on upper bounds of permissible wealth, challenging the unlimited wealth accumulation permitted by both libertarian and many liberal egalitarian theories.

@book{pedersen2020distributive,
  author = {Pedersen, Jørgen},
  title = {Distributive Justice and Taxation},
  year = {2020},
  publisher = {Routledge},
  doi = {10.4324/9780429316753},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides comprehensive philosophical analysis of taxation as instrument of distributive justice, examining income tax, wealth tax, and inheritance tax from multiple theoretical perspectives (Rawlsian, libertarian, utilitarian, luck egalitarian). Argues that inheritance tax is particularly justified because it addresses inequalities arising from unchosen circumstances (family background) while avoiding disincentive effects on labor. Defends progressive taxation including wealth taxation on grounds that it better tracks ability to pay than income taxation alone.

  RELEVANCE: Directly engages the comparison between income-based and wealth-based approaches to distributive obligations. Pedersen's analysis of wealth taxation versus income taxation provides theoretical framework for comparing these different obligation bases. His argument that wealth taxes avoid labor disincentives while targeting unchosen inequalities suggests potential advantages of asset-based obligations over income-based ones, though he focuses on taxation rather than voluntary giving. The book's examination of ability-to-pay principles across different tax bases is particularly relevant.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian approach synthesizing multiple theories to justify progressive taxation of income, wealth, and inheritance, with emphasis on wealth and inheritance as particularly just targets due to their connection to unchosen circumstances.

  title = {Locke and the Fundamental Right to Preservation: on the Convergence of Charity and Property Rights},
  journal = {The Review of Politics},
  year = {2015},
  volume = {77},
  pages = {191--215},
  doi = {10.1017/S0034670515000030},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reinterprets Locke's theory to show that property rights and duties of charity are not contradictory but both derive from the fundamental right to preservation. Argues that Lockean charity grounds coercively enforceable distributive obligations without infringing property rights, because both property rights and charity rights stem from God's grant that each person has right to means of preservation. This theological commitment means property rights are not absolute but constrained by others' preservation needs from the outset.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses the central tension in the research project between property rights (to retained assets/income) and obligations of beneficence (to give to those in need). Udi's reconciliation suggests that even within strong property rights frameworks, asset holdings may be subject to preservation-based obligations. This supports exploring whether these obligations should track assets (which provide security/preservation) differently than income. The Lockean framework also connects to contemporary debates about sufficiency thresholds and basic needs.

  POSITION: Reconciliationist position showing that robust property rights and significant charitable obligations can coexist when both are grounded in fundamental rights to preservation, challenging both pure libertarian and pure redistributive views.

@incollection{white2018moral,
  author = {White, Stuart},
  title = {Moral Objections to Inheritance Tax},
  booktitle = {The Political Economy of Asset Accumulation},
  year = {2018},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780199609222.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematically addresses and refutes four common moral objections to inheritance taxation: (1) double taxation concern, (2) differential treatment based on wealth use, (3) penalizing virtuous behavior, and (4) targeting holdings rather than consumption. White argues these objections fail to undermine the justice case for inheritance tax, which rests on preventing accumulation of unearned advantage and promoting equal opportunity. Distinguishes between equity in treatment (treating similar cases similarly) and equity as fairness in distribution.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical defense of treating assets (particularly inherited wealth) differently from earned income for tax purposes, which parallels the research project's investigation of whether assets warrant different treatment for charitable obligations. White's refutation of the "double taxation" objection is particularly relevant, as similar arguments might be raised against asset-based charitable norms (claiming assets are already "after-tax" income). His analysis clarifies how differential treatment can be justified on fairness grounds.

  POSITION: Liberal egalitarian defense of inheritance taxation specifically, arguing that wealth transfers create distinct justice concerns that warrant distinct policy responses beyond general income taxation.

@article{timmer2024limitarianism,

  title = {Limitarianism, Upper Limits, and Minimal Thresholds},
  journal = {Res Publica},

  volume = {30},
  pages = {845--863},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-024-09662-2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes the conceptual structure of limitarianism, distinguishing two interpretations of "excess resources" above the riches line: (1) resources have zero moral value for the holder, vs. (2) resources have value but other normative concerns outweigh the holder's claim. Argues limitarians should focus on either the number of people with excess resources or total amount of excess (or both) depending on which values the theory prioritizes, and that both redistributive and predistributive measures may be appropriate.

  RELEVANCE: Refines the theoretical framework for thinking about upper wealth limits based on marginal utility considerations. Timmer's distinction between zero-value and outweighed-value interpretations maps onto the research question about marginal utility of assets: beyond the security threshold, do assets have low marginal utility (not zero) that gets outweighed by others' needs? His analysis of what metrics matter (number above threshold vs. total excess) could inform how asset-based obligation norms should be structured.

  POSITION: Develops internal structure of limitarianism as distinct distributive theory, clarifying how upper limits can be justified and implemented through various policy mechanisms.

@article{kramm2020limits,

  title = {Limits to wealth in the history of Western philosophy},
  journal = {European Journal of Philosophy},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1111/ejop.12535},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys proto-limitarian arguments throughout history of philosophy, finding that many canonical philosophers (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Mill) made claims that wealth should be limited. Identifies four moral domains for limitarian arguments: moral psychology (wealth corrupts character), moral reasoning (wealth distorts judgment), virtue ethics (excessive wealth incompatible with virtue), and political morality (wealth undermines political equality). Shows that intrinsic arguments for wealth limitation (beyond instrumental effects) are common historically.

  RELEVANCE: Provides historical philosophical grounding for the intuition that excessive wealth is problematic independent of its effects—relevant if the research project uncovers that assets warrant different treatment due to their inherent characteristics rather than just their consequences. The historical survey reveals persistent philosophical concern with wealth limits that predates modern inequality data, suggesting deep normative worries about asset concentration. The distinction between intrinsic and instrumental arguments may help clarify whether asset-based obligations are justified by asset characteristics or their effects.

  POSITION: Historical analysis supporting contemporary limitarianism by showing its deep roots in Western philosophical tradition across multiple schools of thought.

  title = {The Philosophical Foundations of Wealth Transfer Taxation},
  booktitle = {Tax Law and Policy in the 21st Century},
  year = {2017},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198798439.003.0010},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines wealth transfer taxation from multiple philosophical perspectives (utilitarianism, Rawlsian justice, libertarianism, capabilities approach), arguing that most major political philosophies support some form of wealth transfer taxation. The chapter demonstrates that wealth transfer taxes serve expressive function of affirming society's distributive justice commitments beyond revenue generation. Argues wealth transfer taxation achieves goals of reducing unequal opportunity more effectively than alternatives.

  RELEVANCE: Provides multi-theoretical framework for evaluating asset-specific taxation that could be adapted to voluntary asset-based giving norms. The finding that diverse philosophical traditions converge on supporting wealth transfer taxation (despite disagreeing on income taxation) suggests something distinctive about the moral status of asset transfers. This convergence may indicate that assets warrant different normative treatment than income across multiple ethical frameworks, not just utilitarian ones.

  POSITION: Pluralist approach showing that wealth transfer taxation can be justified from multiple philosophical perspectives, suggesting robust philosophical consensus on treating wealth transfers distinctly.

  journal = {Public Sector Economics},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {44},
  number = {4},
  doi = {10.3326/pse.44.4.2},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents empirical and normative analysis showing that inheritance fundamentally violates meritocratic justice principles but faces low political support due to family values. Uses survey data to demonstrate inconsistencies in people's views: they simultaneously endorse equal opportunity and accept inheritance despite inheritance being primary mechanism of unequal opportunity. Argues family values trump distributive justice concerns in public opinion, creating barrier to inheritance taxation despite its justice rationale.

  RELEVANCE: Highlights the political psychology challenge for any proposal (including asset-based giving norms) that asks individuals to limit asset transfers to family members. The finding that family values dominate distributive justice concerns suggests that voluntary asset-based giving norms might face resistance even if philosophically justified. However, the paper focuses on bequests rather than lifetime asset holdings, so the psychological barriers may differ for charitable giving from existing assets versus limiting inheritance.

  POSITION: Empirically-informed normative analysis showing gap between justice principles (which support inheritance taxation) and public attitudes (which resist it due to family values).

  year = {2015},
  volume = {46},
  number = {2},
  doi = {10.1111/josp.12096},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides novel interpretation of Marx's Abilities/Needs Principle as capturing important ideas about solidarity, fair reciprocity, and self-realization in work that contemporary liberal egalitarianism overlooks. Argues the principle requires sensitivity to individual differences in abilities and needs, duties to contribute according to capacity, and distribution according to needs rather than market value. Emphasizes work as site of self-realization, not just means to consumption, and solidarity as intrinsically valuable beyond instrumental reciprocity.

  RELEVANCE: While not directly about wealth ethics, Gilabert's analysis of needs-based distribution principles provides alternative framework to wealth-based or income-based approaches. The emphasis on individual differences in "abilities" and "needs" could inform how asset-based vs. income-based obligations should account for varying circumstances—perhaps those with greater asset-holding ability have stronger obligations. The principle's focus on fair reciprocity and avoiding free-riding may parallel concerns about asset holders benefiting from societal stability without proportional contribution.

  POSITION: Socialist interpretation offering alternative to both libertarian and liberal egalitarian frameworks, emphasizing solidarity and needs-based distribution over market-based or rights-based approaches.

@article{axelsen2020expressive,

  title = {The expressive injustice of being rich},
  journal = {Analysis},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1093/analys/anaa012},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that extreme wealth is expressively unjust—it conveys the message that the rich person's interests matter vastly more than others' interests, violating interpersonal justification requirements. Beyond consequences for inequality or poverty, being extremely rich is itself a "preposterous" claim from the standpoint of interpersonal morality, because it asserts entitlement to vastly more resources than needed for flourishing while others lack basic necessities. The injustice is in the expressive content, not just distributive effects.

  RELEVANCE: Provides distinctive argument for asset limits based on expressive meaning rather than consequences or rights violations. This could complement utilitarian arguments for asset-based obligations: even if marginal utility diminishes gradually, at some point asset retention becomes expressively unjust. The focus on what wealth "says" about one's view of others' moral status adds dimension to the research question beyond marginal utility calculations. Suggests that very high asset thresholds might be unjustifiable even if marginal utility has not reached zero.

  POSITION: Develops expressivist argument for upper wealth limits that is independent of consequentialist and deontological considerations, emphasizing the meaning and justifiability of resource claims to others.

  volume = {47},
  pages = {1331--1339},
  doi = {10.1007/s11406-018-0030-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends limitarian policies as means to political equality against two objections: (1) that limitarianism inefficiently burdens the rich to achieve political equality (could use alternative means), and (2) that limiting wealth is insufficient to guarantee political equality (need additional measures). Argues limitarian policies avoid productivity losses by focusing on wealth above flourishing threshold, and that while not sufficient for political equality, they are valuable partial step that should complement other strategies.

  RELEVANCE: Addresses implementation challenges for any asset-based obligation system, including voluntary giving norms. Timmer's response to the efficiency objection—that targeting wealth above the flourishing threshold minimizes productivity costs—parallels the research project's focus on assets beyond security thresholds where marginal utility is low. The acknowledgment that asset limits alone are insufficient suggests any asset-based charitable norms would need integration with other mechanisms, not replacement of income-based approaches.

  POSITION: Defends democratic/political equality rationale for limitarianism while acknowledging need for complementary policies, positioning limitarianism as partial but important component of egalitarian distributive justice.

  volume = {79},
  pages = {649--674},
  doi = {10.1017/S0034670517000602},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Tocqueville's approach to social question of poverty and inequality through lens of rights rather than charity. Argues Tocqueville distinguished between legal rights (enforceable) and duties of charity (moral but unenforceable), opposing public relief as rights-based but supporting private charity. Tocqueville worried that framing aid as legal right would undermine individual moral responsibility and create dependency, preferring voluntary charitable relationships that maintain human dignity and reciprocal moral development.

  RELEVANCE: Tocqueville's framework highlights the choice between mandatory redistribution (through taxation) and voluntary giving (through charity) that underlies debates about whether asset-based obligations should be enforceable or voluntary. His concern that legal rights to aid undermine moral relationships may inform whether the research project should focus on voluntary norms or policy proposals. The emphasis on charity preserving moral relationships between giver and recipient could bear on whether asset-based giving norms should remain within voluntary sphere rather than becoming tax obligations.

  POSITION: Tocquevillian approach emphasizing voluntary charity over legal entitlements as means of addressing poverty while preserving moral relationships and individual responsibility.

  year = {2019},
  volume = {11},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-025852},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews empirical literature on wealth inequality dynamics globally, showing dramatic increase in wealth concentration since 1980s: top 1% wealth share increased from 28% to 33% for China, Europe, and US combined. Documents methodological challenges in measuring wealth at the top due to financial globalization, tax havens, and offshore assets. Argues traditional survey and tax data underestimate true wealth inequality, as evidenced by leaks from financial institutions and tax amnesty data revealing hidden wealth.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical foundation for philosophical debates about wealth ethics by documenting the scale and concentration of global wealth. The finding that wealth inequality has increased dramatically supports urgency of examining asset-based obligations. The methodological challenges in measuring top wealth holdings are relevant for implementing any asset-based giving norms—if wealth can be easily hidden or moved offshore, voluntary norms or policies targeting assets face enforcement challenges that income-based approaches may avoid. The empirical reality of extreme wealth concentration grounds normative questions about its justification.

  POSITION: Empirical economics rather than normative philosophy, but documents inequality trends that motivate philosophical inquiry into wealth ethics and asset-based obligations.

  doi = {10.21201/2020.5419},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Documents extreme wealth concentration (world's billionaires have more wealth than 4.6 billion people) and connects it to gender inequality through unpaid care work. Argues the global economic system is "flawed and sexist" by valuing wealth of privileged few over billions of hours of essential care work done primarily by women. Proposes policy solutions including care system investments, progressive taxation (including wealth taxes), and legislation protecting carers.

  RELEVANCE: Provides contemporary empirical context for ethical debates about wealth concentration and connects wealth inequality to gender justice issues. The proposal for wealth taxation alongside income taxation suggests policy-makers increasingly view assets as appropriate target for progressive redistribution, supporting philosophical examination of asset-based obligations. The gender dimension highlights how wealth ethics intersects with other justice concerns—relevant if asset holdings have gendered patterns distinct from income.

  POSITION: Advocacy research linking wealth inequality to gender injustice and proposing progressive wealth taxation as part of broader equality agenda, representing practical policy perspective on wealth ethics.

  pages = {589--607},
  doi = {10.1007/s11158-023-09646-8},

  CORE ARGUMENT: Critically examines the democratic argument for limitarianism, which holds that wealth limits are needed to prevent political inequality. Questions whether limitarian policies would effectively protect democracy, arguing that moderately wealthy individuals can still exercise problematic political influence, and that non-wealthy entities (corporations, foreign governments) also threaten political equality. Proposes focusing on political system resilience rather than wealth limits per se.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges one major justification for treating assets distinctly (their threat to political equality), raising questions about whether asset-based obligations are best justified on democratic grounds or other bases like marginal utility. If Volacu is correct that wealth limits alone cannot secure political equality, this strengthens arguments for justifying asset-based norms on utilitarian grounds (diminishing marginal utility) rather than political equality grounds. Suggests any asset-based framework should be clear about which values it aims to serve.

  POSITION: Critical engagement with limitarianism that accepts wealth inequality as problem but questions whether wealth limits are effective solution, advocating for systemic political reforms instead.

  title = {Charity: Public or Private?},
  journal = {New Perspectives on Political Economy},
  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.62374/atqc1347},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues from libertarian perspective that charity belongs squarely in private sector due to its reliance on voluntary contributions and private property rights, contrasting with public sector's dependence on compulsory taxation. While charities serve public needs, they do so without coercive mechanism characteristic of state, making them compatible with free-market values. Rejects categorization of charity as sui generis "third sector," asserting stronger affinity with private sector.

  RELEVANCE: Represents libertarian perspective on asset use and charitable giving that contrasts sharply with redistributive approaches. Block's framework treats all charitable giving as supererogatory (beyond duty) rather than obligatory, challenging the project's premise that there are utilitarian obligations to give. However, the emphasis on voluntary nature of charity highlights important question: should asset-based obligations be conceived as moral duties or as social norms for voluntary behavior? The libertarian position provides counter-perspective against which to test asset-based obligation arguments.

  POSITION: Libertarian view treating charity as entirely voluntary private-sector activity without obligatory character, resisting both enforceable obligations and strong moral requirements to give.
