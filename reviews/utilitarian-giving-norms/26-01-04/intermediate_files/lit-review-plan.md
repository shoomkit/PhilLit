# Literature Review Plan: Utilitarian Giving Norms - Income vs. Asset-Based Obligations

## Research Idea Summary

This project examines whether utilitarian obligations to charitable giving are better captured by income-based norms (e.g., the 10% pledge) or asset-based norms. The research investigates a systematic asymmetry: beyond a security threshold, marginal utility of additional assets is low (serving insurance, optionality, or positional aims), while income often bears higher marginal utility due to ongoing needs. The project explores whether asset-sensitive giving strategies are favored under plausible expected-utility assumptions.

## Key Research Questions

1. What utilitarian grounds support obligations to donate to charity, and how demanding are these obligations?
2. How does marginal utility theory apply differently to income versus accumulated wealth/assets?
3. Why do existing philanthropic norms (Giving What We Can, effective altruism) emphasize income-based giving?
4. What moral considerations favor asset-based or time-deferred giving strategies?
5. Under expected-utility frameworks, how should donors weigh immediate giving against investment for future giving?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Utilitarian Theory of Beneficence and Demandingness

**Focus**: The theoretical foundations of utilitarian obligations to aid others, including the demandingness objection and responses to it.

**Key Questions**:
- What does impartial welfarist utilitarianism require regarding charitable giving?
- How have philosophers addressed the demandingness objection?
- What role do agent-relative prerogatives play in moderating utilitarian demands?
- How do threshold and satisficing approaches affect giving obligations?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entries on "Consequentialism," "The Moral Status of Beneficence," "World Poverty and Human Rights"
- Key terms: ["utilitarian demandingness," "obligation to aid," "beneficence," "Singer famine affluence morality," "Unger living high," "impartial welfarism," "supererogation charity"]
- Expected papers: 12-15 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Establishes the theoretical basis for any utilitarian giving obligation, which the project then operationalizes through income vs. asset norms.

### Domain 2: Marginal Utility Theory and Wealth

**Focus**: Economic and philosophical literature on diminishing marginal utility, particularly as it applies to income versus accumulated wealth.

**Key Questions**:
- How does marginal utility differ between income flows and asset stocks?
- What utility functions are appropriate for modeling wealth accumulation?
- How do positional goods and insurance motives affect the marginal utility of assets?
- What is the relationship between wealth thresholds and welfare?

- Primary sources: Economics literature on utility theory, philosophical discussions of wealth and welfare
- Key terms: ["diminishing marginal utility wealth," "utility of income," "marginal utility assets," "positional goods," "precautionary savings motive," "wealth welfare function," "sufficiency threshold"]
- Expected papers: 10-12 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Directly supports the core argument that assets beyond a threshold have lower marginal utility than income, grounding the case for asset-sensitive giving.

---

### Domain 3: Effective Altruism and Philanthropic Norms

**Focus**: The philosophical foundations and critiques of effective altruism, including specific giving pledges and their justifications.

**Key Questions**:
- What are the philosophical foundations of effective altruism?
- How is the 10% income pledge (Giving What We Can) justified?
- What critiques have been raised against EA giving norms?
- Are there existing discussions of asset-based vs. income-based giving in EA literature?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: SEP entry on "Effective Altruism," MacAskill, Singer, and related works
- Key terms: ["effective altruism," "Giving What We Can," "earning to give," "philanthropic pledges," "10 percent pledge," "MacAskill doing good better," "longtermism philanthropy"]
- Expected papers: 12-15 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Maps the current landscape of giving norms that the project seeks to critique and potentially revise.

---

### Domain 4: Philosophy of Personal Finance and Asset Ethics

**Focus**: Ethical considerations surrounding wealth accumulation, inheritance, and the moral status of holding assets.

**Key Questions**:
- What moral considerations govern wealth accumulation and retention?
- How do ethical theories address inheritance and intergenerational wealth transfer?
- What obligations arise from holding significant assets while others lack necessities?
- How do property rights interact with beneficence obligations?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Literature on distributive justice, property rights, wealth inequality
- Key terms: ["ethics wealth accumulation," "inheritance justice," "property rights beneficence," "wealth inequality ethics," "asset taxation justice," "billionaire philanthropy ethics"]
- Expected papers: 8-10 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Provides ethical frameworks for evaluating asset holdings, supporting the argument that assets may be subject to stronger giving obligations than income.

---

### Domain 5: Decision Theory and Giving Under Uncertainty

**Focus**: How decision theory and expected utility frameworks apply to the timing and form of charitable giving.

**Key Questions**:
- How should donors weigh immediate giving against investment for future giving?
- What discount rates are appropriate for philanthropic decision-making?
- How do considerations of cause prioritization affect giving timing?
- What role does uncertainty about future opportunities play?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Decision theory literature, EA discussions of timing and investment
- Key terms: ["giving timing philanthropy," "patient philanthropy," "philanthropic discount rate," "investment to give," "cause prioritization," "expected value charity," "longtermism giving"]
- Expected papers: 8-10 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: Addresses the third option in the donor's choice set (deferring donation through investment) and provides analytical tools for comparing income vs. asset-based strategies.

---

### Domain 6: Empirical Research on Giving Behavior

**Focus**: Psychological and economic research on how people actually give, including motivational factors and behavioral patterns.

**Key Questions**:
- What motivates charitable giving behavior empirically?
- How do income vs. wealth affect giving patterns?
- What is the relationship between pledges/commitments and actual giving?
- How do social norms influence giving behavior?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Psychology and behavioral economics journals, experimental philosophy
- Key terms: ["psychology charitable giving," "wealth giving behavior," "income effect donations," "philanthropic motivation," "giving pledge effectiveness," "warm glow giving," "altruism behavioral economics"]
- Expected papers: 8-10 key papers

**Relevance to Project**: While primarily normative, the project should engage with empirical findings about what giving norms are psychologically realistic and motivationally effective.

## Coverage Rationale

These six domains provide comprehensive coverage by addressing:
1. **Theoretical foundations** (Domain 1): Why utilitarians have any giving obligation
2. **Core analytical framework** (Domain 2): The marginal utility asymmetry central to the argument
3. **Current norms** (Domain 3): What the project aims to evaluate and potentially revise
4. **Asset-specific ethics** (Domain 4): Moral status of wealth accumulation
5. **Decision-theoretic considerations** (Domain 5): Timing and uncertainty in giving
6. **Empirical grounding** (Domain 6): Feasibility and psychological realism

The domains progress from abstract theory to practical implementation, covering both the normative case for asset-based giving and the empirical constraints on any giving norm.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary thoughts on gaps the research could fill:
- **Direct comparison**: Little existing work directly compares income vs. asset-based giving norms
- **Marginal utility asymmetry**: The specific argument about differential marginal utility of income vs. assets appears underexplored
- **Threshold specification**: Existing work lacks precise analysis of what constitutes a "reasonable security threshold"
- **Mixed strategies**: How to combine income and asset considerations in practical giving norms
- **Life-cycle giving**: How giving obligations should vary across the wealth accumulation lifecycle

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 6
- **Estimated papers**: 58-72 total
- **Key positions**:
  - Strong utilitarian demandingness (Singer, Unger)
  - Moderate demandingness with agent-relative permissions
  - Effective altruism orthodoxy (income-based norms)
  - Wealth-focused critiques (asset taxation, inheritance ethics)
  - Patient philanthropy / longtermism
  - Behavioral realism constraints

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works**: Singer's "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," Unger's "Living High and Letting Die," MacAskill on EA
2. **Recent developments**: Longtermism debates, patient philanthropy, updated EA methodology (2020-2025)
3. **Critical responses**: Demandingness objections, critiques of EA, behavioral economics on giving limits
4. **Cross-disciplinary**: Economics literature on marginal utility of wealth, psychology of charitable behavior

## Notes for Researchers

- **Use SEP extensively** for Domains 1, 3, and 4 via `search_sep.py` and `fetch_sep.py` for foundational context
- **PhilPapers** via `search_philpapers.py` is essential for Domains 1, 3, 4, and 5
- **Economics literature** (Domains 2, 6) will require `s2_search.py` and `search_openalex.py` with economics-focused terms
- **Recent EA debates** may appear on arXiv; use `search_arxiv.py` for longtermism and patient philanthropy discussions
- **Include empirical work** even though the project is primarily normative; behavioral constraints matter for norm design
- **Flag any existing work** that directly addresses income vs. asset-based giving norms, as this is the core gap
- **Cross-reference** between domains: marginal utility literature should inform demandingness debates; EA norms should be evaluated against decision-theoretic frameworks
