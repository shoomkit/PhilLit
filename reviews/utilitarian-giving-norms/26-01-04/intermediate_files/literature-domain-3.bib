====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

Effective altruism (EA) is both a philosophical movement and practical framework
that emerged in the early 2010s, advocating for using evidence and reason to
determine how to benefit others as much as possible with limited resources. The
movement's philosophical foundations draw on utilitarian principles while
attempting to remain theoretically ecumenical. MacAskill's "Doing Good Better"
(2015) and the edited volume by Greaves and Pummer (2019) provide foundational
texts. Singer's earlier "Famine, Affluence, and Morality" (1972) laid crucial
groundwork with its argument for stringent obligations to prevent suffering.

The Giving What We Can (GWTC) pledge represents EA's most visible commitment
mechanism: pledgers commit to donating at least 10% of lifetime income to
effective charities. This income-based norm has generated both participation
(Wilks et al. 2023 found distinctive psychological profiles among pledgers)
and philosophical scrutiny. Aloyo (2023) critiques the 10% threshold,
arguing for progressive giving based on capacity rather than fixed percentages.
This debate connects directly to questions about whether giving norms should
track income, wealth, or some other metric of capacity.

Major critiques cluster around three themes: (1) Philosophical critiques
question EA's utilitarian commitments and impartiality demands (Gabriel 2017,
McMahan 2016); (2) Institutional critiques argue EA neglects systemic change
in favor of individual donations (Berkey 2017, Dietz 2019); (3) Justice-based
critiques contend EA sidesteps questions of equality, rights, and structural
injustice (Rubenstein 2016, Crary 2023). Recent work explores EA's relationship
to democracy (Lechterman 2020), religious traditions (Roser et al. 2022), and
its psychological underpinnings (Caviola et al. 2021, Schubert & Caviola 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

This domain directly addresses the research question about income-based vs.
asset-based giving norms. The 10% income pledge represents the paradigmatic
income-based norm in contemporary utilitarian philanthropy. Aloyo's progressive
giving proposal and the broader EA literature on demandingness provide crucial
context for evaluating whether marginal utility considerations favor shifting
from income to asset-based metrics. The critiques also illuminate potential
limitations of purely utilitarian approaches to charitable obligations.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Despite extensive discussion of "how much to give," there is surprisingly little
explicit analysis of *what* to give from (income vs. wealth/assets). The pledge
literature focuses almost entirely on income, with minimal consideration of
whether high-net-worth individuals' asset holdings should factor into giving
obligations. The relationship between EA's "earning to give" strategy and wealth
accumulation also remains underexplored relative to obligations based on existing
wealth.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

Key papers to prioritize: MacAskill (2019) for EA definition; Aloyo (2023) for
progressive giving; Wilks et al. (2023) for empirical pledge data; Gabriel (2017),
Berkey (2017) for major critiques; Singer (1972) for foundational obligations
argument. The synthesis should trace how EA moved from Singer's abstract
principles to concrete pledge mechanisms, noting the gap between theoretical
flexibility and practical income-centrism.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Standard EA: 10% of income (Giving What We Can pledge) - 3 papers
- Progressive giving: Capacity-based rather than fixed percentage (Aloyo) - 1 paper
- Institutional critique: Focus on systemic change over individual giving - 4 papers
- Philosophical critique: Challenge utilitarian/impartial foundations - 5 papers
- Empirical research: Psychology and demographics of effective altruists - 3 papers
- Sympathetic defenses: EA as broad framework, not rigid doctrine - 2 papers

  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill provides the canonical definition of effective altruism as the project of using evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible, and taking action on that basis. Importantly, he distinguishes EA from strict utilitarianism, arguing EA is theoretically ecumenical and compatible with various moral frameworks. He addresses common misconceptions: EA is not just about poverty, not just about donations, and does not ignore systemic change.

  RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding how EA self-defines and what theoretical commitments it actually makes versus those attributed to it by critics. MacAskill's emphasis on EA as a "project" rather than a complete moral theory is crucial for evaluating whether income-based giving norms are intrinsic to EA or merely conventional. His discussion of "doing the most good we can" with "the resources in our possession" opens questions about which resources (income vs. wealth) should count.

  POSITION: Definitional/foundational work by EA's primary philosophical architect, emphasizing theoretical flexibility while maintaining practical commitment to effectiveness metrics.

  title = {Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference},
  publisher = {Gotham Books},
  address = {New York},
  year = {2015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: MacAskill's popular introduction to effective altruism argues that conventional charity often fails to maximize impact due to lack of rigorous evaluation. He introduces frameworks for comparing charitable interventions (focusing on scale, tractability, neglectedness) and defends "earning to give" as a potentially high-impact career path. The book promotes the 10% giving pledge as an accessible commitment mechanism while acknowledging more demanding obligations may apply.

  RELEVANCE: This is the movement's primary public-facing text and established many EA conventions, including the prominence of the 10% income pledge. The "earning to give" discussion is particularly relevant to the research question: if high earners should maximize income to donate 10%, what role do accumulated assets play? MacAskill focuses on income flows rather than stock of wealth, which may reflect an implicit assumption that deserves scrutiny.

  POSITION: Popularization of EA principles with emphasis on practical giving mechanisms; influential in establishing income-based norms as EA standard.

@article{aloyo2023effective,
  author = {Aloyo, Eamon},
  title = {Effective Altruism, Tithing, and a Principle of Progressive Giving},
  journal = {Ethics \& Global Politics},
  volume = {16},
  pages = {20--34},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1080/16544951.2023.2246257},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Aloyo critiques MacAskill, Mogensen, and Ord's proposal for a 10% giving norm (tithing) on four grounds: demandingness, fairness, net wealth, and historical injustices. He argues that a progressive giving principle better captures the reasons EA theorists give for charitable obligations. Progressive giving would scale with capacity rather than applying a fixed percentage, addressing concerns that 10% is too demanding for low earners and insufficiently demanding for the wealthy.

  RELEVANCE: This paper directly addresses the research question by challenging income-based percentage norms and proposing capacity-based alternatives. Aloyo's "net wealth" objection is particularly salient: he argues giving norms should consider total resources, not just income flows. This suggests assets matter morally for determining obligations, potentially supporting a shift toward wealth-based or capacity-based metrics. The paper represents the most explicit philosophical engagement with the income vs. asset question in EA literature.

  POSITION: Progressive giving based on capacity; challenges fixed-percentage income norms as insufficiently sensitive to individual circumstances and resources.

  journal = {Journal of Personality},
  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1111/jopy.12842},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This empirical study (N=536) examines psychological and cognitive traits distinguishing Giving What We Can pledgers from matched controls. Pledgers showed better fearful face recognition, greater moral circle expansion, higher actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition, and higher utilitarian inclinations. Contrary to predictions, pledgers scored lower on maximizing tendency. The findings suggest pledgers are a distinctive population characterized by expanded moral concern combined with analytical thinking.

  RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence about who actually makes and keeps the 10% income pledge, offering insight into whether income-based commitment mechanisms attract a particular demographic or psychological profile. The study's finding that pledgers expand their moral circles but don't simply maximize suggests complexity in EA motivations beyond simple utility calculation. Understanding who commits to income-based pledges helps evaluate whether such norms effectively capture those with genuine capacity to give.

  POSITION: Empirical psychology of effective altruists; demonstrates distinctive cognitive and moral profiles among those committing to income-based giving.

@article{singer1972famine,

  title = {Famine, Affluence, and Morality},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Public Affairs},

  pages = {229--243},
  year = {1972},
  doi = {10.4324/9781315254210-1},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Singer argues that if we can prevent something bad without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought to do it. Applied to global poverty, this principle generates demanding obligations: affluent individuals should give until they reach marginal utility (the point where giving more would cause comparable harm to themselves). Singer distinguishes strong and weak versions but suggests even the weak version requires radical changes in giving behavior.

  RELEVANCE: This foundational paper established the philosophical basis for demanding obligations to aid that EA later operationalized. Crucially, Singer's principle is framed in terms of preventing bad outcomes, not specific resource bases (income vs. wealth). The marginal utility standard could apply to either income or accumulated assets. EA's operationalization through income-based pledges represents one implementation, but Singer's abstract principle doesn't mandate income focus. This gap between theory and practice is central to evaluating alternative giving norms.

  POSITION: Strong utilitarian obligation to give; foundational text for EA movement; abstract principle doesn't specify income vs. wealth basis.

@article{gabriel2017critics,

  title = {Effective Altruism and Its Critics},
  journal = {Journal of Applied Philosophy},
  volume = {34},
  number = {4},
  pages = {457--473},
  year = {2017},
  doi = {10.1111/japp.12176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Gabriel systematically evaluates three major critiques of EA: (1) the justice critique (EA neglects equality, rights, and urgency); (2) the methodological critique (EA's emphasis on quantification creates bias); and (3) the systemic change critique (EA focuses on symptoms rather than root causes). He argues critics overstate their case but identifies legitimate concerns about EA's tendency to sideline justice considerations and its methodological limitations in domains difficult to quantify.

  RELEVANCE: This comprehensive overview of EA criticisms helps situate the income vs. wealth question within broader debates. The justice critique is particularly relevant: if EA's utilitarian framework inadequately addresses distributive justice, this might extend to questions about fair taxation of wealth vs. income. The methodological critique also applies—income is easier to measure and track than wealth, which may explain EA's practical focus on income despite theoretical neutrality.

  POSITION: Systematic evaluation of EA critiques; finds partial merit in justice and methodological concerns while defending EA's core commitments.

@article{berkey2018institutional,
  author = {Berkey, Brian},
  title = {The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism},
  journal = {Utilitas},
  volume = {30},
  number = {2},
  pages = {143--171},
  year = {2018},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820817000176},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Berkey defends EA against the "institutional critique," which claims EA unjustifiably neglects institutional change in favor of individual charitable giving. He argues this critique either (1) mischaracterizes EA's core commitments, which are compatible with working for institutional change, or (2) fails to show that pursuing institutional change would be more effective than EA's current approaches. EA's emphasis on effectiveness means it should pursue institutional reform if that proves most impactful.

  RELEVANCE: The institutional critique connects to the income vs. wealth question indirectly: if EA's individualistic focus on donation pledges obscures structural questions (like wealth taxation), this represents a limitation. Berkey's defense suggests EA is theoretically open to institutional approaches but has pragmatically focused on individual giving. Whether income-based pledges represent genuine EA commitments or practical compromises affects how readily EA could adopt alternative frameworks, including wealth-based approaches.

  POSITION: Defense of EA against institutional critique; argues EA is compatible with systemic change advocacy if evidence supports it.

  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198841364.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume collects philosophical analyses of EA from various perspectives. Contributors examine EA's relationship to utilitarianism, demandingness, common-sense morality, and partiality. The volume includes both sympathetic refinements of EA principles and substantial criticisms. Chapters address theoretical foundations, practical applications, and EA's treatment of future generations and non-human animals.

  RELEVANCE: Provides the most comprehensive philosophical treatment of EA to date. Multiple chapters engage questions about demandingness and what resources EA obligations apply to, though surprisingly little explicitly addresses income vs. wealth distinctions. The volume's theoretical depth helps ground evaluation of whether EA's practical conventions (like income-based pledges) follow from its philosophical commitments or represent contingent choices.

  POSITION: Comprehensive scholarly examination of EA from multiple philosophical perspectives; establishes EA as subject of serious academic inquiry.

@article{dietz2019effective,

  number = {1},
  pages = {106--115},
  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1017/S0953820818000158},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Dietz argues that EA's individualistic framework inadequately addresses collective obligations. In situations where coordinated group action would produce better outcomes than uncoordinated individual optimization, EA's principle of "do the most good you can" may be self-defeating. He uses formal analysis of collective action problems to show that individual-level EA reasoning can lead to suboptimal collective outcomes, suggesting EA needs an account of collective obligations.

  RELEVANCE: Collective action framing applies to wealth taxation debates: individual voluntary asset-based giving may be less effective than coordinated policy changes (e.g., wealth taxes). If EA cannot adequately address collective obligations, this limits its ability to evaluate structural alternatives to individual income-based pledges. The paper suggests EA's individualistic focus may miss important moral considerations about fair schemes of taxation and redistribution.

  POSITION: Critique of EA's individualism; argues EA needs to incorporate collective obligation framework to avoid coordination failures.

  number = {7},
  pages = {596--607},
  year = {2021},
  doi = {10.1016/j.tics.2021.03.015},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This review synthesizes research on psychological barriers to effective giving. People preferentially help identifiable victims over statistical victims, favor local over distant causes, and weight "warm glow" feelings over impact. Scope insensitivity means people don't proportionally increase giving as numbers helped increase. The authors argue understanding these biases can help design interventions to promote more effective altruism while respecting psychological realities.

  RELEVANCE: The psychological barriers to EA may extend to wealth-based giving norms. Income is more psychologically salient and easier to track than wealth, which may explain conventional focus on income-based pledges despite wealth being a better proxy for capacity. The paper's discussion of identifiability effects also suggests why concrete income-based commitments (like "10% of salary") may be more motivating than abstract wealth-based obligations, even if the latter are more justified.

  POSITION: Empirical psychology of charitable giving; identifies systematic biases that EA seeks to overcome through evidence-based approaches.

  pages = {511--526},
  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.1017/S0892679416000484},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Rubenstein offers a sympathetic but critical analysis of EA, arguing it has important lessons for aid practitioners while harboring problematic commitments. EA's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and evidence is valuable, but its neglect of political context, rights-based frameworks, and power asymmetries is concerning. She illustrates with case of a librarian who donated $1M locally versus to "most effective" global charities, arguing EA's dismissal of local giving overlooks legitimate moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: The librarian case illustrates how EA's maximizing framework can conflict with other moral considerations, including communal obligations and gratitude. Applied to giving norms, this suggests income-based pledges may be easier to universalize while wealth-based obligations might involve more complex contextual factors (e.g., inherited vs. earned wealth, illiquid assets). Rubenstein's emphasis on non-utilitarian moral considerations points to limitations of purely effectiveness-based frameworks for setting giving standards.

  pages = {92--99},
  year = {2016},
  doi = {10.5840/tpm20167379},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: McMahan, while broadly sympathetic to EA, critiques philosophical attacks on the movement as often "derisive" and "weak in argument." He notes critics often ridicule EA practitioners' personal sacrifices rather than engaging substantive philosophical issues. McMahan argues disagreements center on means rather than ends—critics share EA's goal of preventing suffering but dispute whether EA's methods are optimal. He calls for more constructive engagement with EA's empirical claims about effectiveness.

  RELEVANCE: McMahan's meta-critique suggests evaluating EA requires distinguishing its core ethical commitments from its practical conventions. If critics and defenders share concern for suffering prevention but dispute implementation, the income vs. wealth question becomes an empirical matter about which resource base better operationalizes shared values. His call for engagement with evidence rather than dismissal applies to evaluating alternative giving norms.

  POSITION: Meta-critique of EA criticism; defends EA practitioners while acknowledging legitimate empirical disputes about effectiveness.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197655696.003.0016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Crary offers a radical critique arguing EA is "philosophically bankrupt and politically pernicious" despite apparent good intentions. EA's compatibility with capitalism and failure to address root causes of suffering make it counterproductive. She combines the institutional critique (EA ignores systemic change) with philosophical critique (EA's ethical framework is flawed) into a "composite critique" arguing EA should be abandoned rather than reformed.

  RELEVANCE: Crary's critique represents the strongest form of rejection of EA's entire framework, including any discussion of giving norms within that framework. If EA's fundamental approach is misguided, debates about income vs. wealth-based obligations within EA are beside the point—the entire project needs replacement. However, even if this radical critique fails, Crary's emphasis on EA's compatibility with existing economic structures raises questions about whether income-focused pledges simply accommodate rather than challenge wealth inequality.

  POSITION: Radical rejection of EA as fundamentally misguided; argues for abandonment rather than reform of EA framework.

  number = {1},
  pages = {88--115},
  year = {2020},
  doi = {10.1086/706867},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Lechterman argues EA faces an unresolved tension between its depoliticized charitable approach and the inherently political nature of addressing global poverty and suffering. EA's emphasis on individual donation decisions sidesteps questions about political obligations, democratic legitimacy, and structural reform. This creates a "political problem": EA cannot remain neutral about politics while effectively addressing problems with fundamentally political causes and solutions.

  RELEVANCE: The political dimension extends to debates about giving norms. Income-based voluntary pledges represent an individualist, market-friendly approach, while wealth-based taxation would require collective political action. EA's difficulty engaging with politics may explain its practical focus on individual income-based commitments rather than advocacy for structural wealth redistribution. If Lechterman is right that EA's depoliticization is problematic, this strengthens the case for considering politically-mediated alternatives to voluntary income-based giving.

  POSITION: Critique of EA's depoliticization; argues EA cannot adequately address global problems without engaging political dimensions.

  year = {2024},
  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780197757376.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This book synthesizes psychological research on effective altruism, explaining why people resist EA principles and how to overcome these barriers. Part I examines cognitive biases (scope insensitivity, identifiability, in-group bias) that lead to ineffective giving. Part II discusses interventions—information, nudges, incentives, and value change—to increase effectiveness. The authors argue EA requires both understanding human psychology and designing systems that work with rather than against psychological tendencies.

  RELEVANCE: Understanding psychological barriers to EA helps evaluate feasibility of different giving norms. Income-based pledges may succeed partly because income is psychologically salient and easy to commit to, while wealth-based obligations face practical and psychological obstacles (wealth harder to measure, more emotionally fraught, involves assets people see as "theirs" in different ways than income flows). The book's discussion of commitment mechanisms also illuminates why public pledges based on transparent metrics (income) may be more effective than complex capacity-based formulas.

  doi = {10.5771/9783748925361},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: This edited volume examines effective altruism from various religious perspectives (Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Islamic). Contributors explore both synergies (shared concern for helping others effectively) and tensions (EA's utilitarianism vs. religious ethics, EA's secular framework vs. faith-based motivations). The book argues religious communities can both learn from and contribute to EA conversations, particularly around virtue ethics, community, and non-consequentialist moral considerations.

  RELEVANCE: Religious tithing traditions provide historical precedent for income-based giving norms (the 10% GWTC pledge echoes religious tithes). However, religious frameworks often include wealth-based obligations too (e.g., Islamic zakat applies to assets, not just income). The religious dialogue illuminates how different moral traditions operationalize giving obligations, potentially offering alternatives to EA's utilitarian framework while maintaining concern for effectiveness.

  POSITION: Interfaith dialogue with EA; explores how religious ethics can enrich and critique EA's secular utilitarian approach.

  year = {2023},
  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904082},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Pearlman critiques "Obligation-Oriented Effective Altruism" (OOEA) for demanding impartial maximization that prohibits helping those near to us. She proposes Mutual Aid as a morally superior alternative: community-based networks of reciprocal support that honor partiality, build solidarity, and address suffering through empathy and care rather than optimization. Mutual Aid, she argues, discharges our duty to address human suffering without EA's problematic impartiality demands.

  RELEVANCE: Pearlman's critique challenges the entire framework of optimizing individual giving (whether income or wealth-based), proposing instead community-oriented reciprocal support. This represents a fundamental alternative to EA's approach. However, if some version of EA's concern for effectiveness is valid, the question becomes whether Mutual Aid and EA approaches are complementary rather than exclusive. The debate illustrates how different moral frameworks generate different giving norms and priorities.

  doi = {10.1353/ken.2023.a904083},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: In response to Pearlman's critique, Mouser argues mutual aid and effective altruism are compatible and mutually enriching rather than opposed. EA's overreliance on charity keeps it on a "firefighter's treadmill" of marginal gains, while mutual aid offers political strategy for systemic change. Rather than abandoning EA's concern for effectiveness, Mouser argues effective altruists should incorporate mutual aid frameworks as part of long-term strategy for maximum impact.

  RELEVANCE: Mouser's synthesis suggests EA's practical focus on individual giving (including income-based pledges) represents a strategic choice rather than necessary commitment. If mutual aid approaches could prove more effective at addressing root causes, EA's own principles would recommend incorporating them. This supports viewing EA as theoretically flexible about implementation methods, which could extend to flexibility about whether income or wealth provides the better basis for giving norms.

  POSITION: Synthetic approach arguing mutual aid and EA are compatible; EA should incorporate mutual aid for greater long-term effectiveness.
