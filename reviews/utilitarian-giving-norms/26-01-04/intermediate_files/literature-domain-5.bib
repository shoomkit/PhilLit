====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines how decision-theoretic frameworks, particularly expected
utility theory, apply to the timing and form of charitable giving. The central
debate concerns whether philanthropists should "give now" or "give later" by
investing resources for future deployment. Phil Trammell's work on "patient
philanthropy" has been foundational, demonstrating that under standard economic
assumptions, philanthropists with low pure time preference should invest most
resources for decades or centuries before disbursing them. This work challenges
conventional philanthropic practice and raises questions about appropriate
discount rates for altruistic decision-making.

The domain also encompasses effective altruism's approach to cause
prioritization, which applies expected value calculations to compare
philanthropic opportunities across different causes, geographies, and time
horizons. Key considerations include: (1) the appropriate discount rate for
philanthropic decision-making, particularly whether to include pure time
preference; (2) uncertainty about future opportunities and existential risks;
(3) the tension between immediate suffering and potentially larger long-term
impact; and (4) practical constraints such as legal disbursement requirements
and organizational sustainability.

Recent developments include the establishment of the Patient Philanthropy Fund
and growing attention to "longtermism"—the view that positively influencing the
far future is a key moral priority. However, critics argue that patient
philanthropy may be legally constrained, ignores urgent present needs, and
relies on questionable assumptions about persistent investment returns and
institutional stability.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research project's central question about
optimal giving norms by examining the temporal dimension: should giving be
triggered by income flows or asset accumulation, and at what rate? The
decision-theoretic framework provides tools for comparing income-based versus
asset-based giving norms under uncertainty about future opportunities, returns,
and needs. Trammell's work on heterogeneous time preferences is particularly
relevant for understanding how different philanthropists might optimally
coordinate their giving timing.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While patient philanthropy literature addresses when to give, it focuses less on
the income versus assets distinction central to this project. There is limited
analysis of how asset-based versus income-based triggers interact with optimal
timing considerations. Additionally, the literature focuses primarily on
ultra-wealthy philanthropists and foundations rather than middle-class donors
subject to the asymmetries this project investigates.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Connect this domain to Domain 2 (Consequentialism & Demandingness) by examining
how temporal considerations affect demandingness: does patient philanthropy make
utilitarian demands more or less onerous? Link to Domain 4 (Asset vs. Income
Taxation) by exploring whether the case for patient philanthropy strengthens
arguments for taxing assets rather than income. Consider how uncertainty about
optimal timing might justify simpler heuristics like the 10% income pledge.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Patient philanthropy (4 papers): Advocates investing resources for extended
  periods before disbursement to maximize long-term impact
- Give now (2 papers): Argues for immediate deployment due to urgent needs,
  institutional risks, and discounting considerations
- Cause prioritization (2 papers): Applies expected value reasoning to compare
  philanthropic opportunities across domains
- Methodological critiques (2 papers): Questions the applicability of expected
  utility theory to philanthropic decisions under deep uncertainty

  author = {Trammell, Philip},
  title = {Dynamic Public Good Provision under Time Preference Heterogeneity: Theory and Applications to Philanthropy},
  year = {2021},

  url = {https://philiptrammell.com/static/PatienceAndPhilanthropy.pdf},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes optimal philanthropic spending timing when funders
  have heterogeneous discount rates. Proves that allowing for time preference
  heterogeneity (rather than assuming a common discount rate) produces
  substantially different equilibrium funding behavior: patient funders invest
  the entirety of their resources for substantial periods rather than spending
  immediately. Demonstrates that patient funders' equilibrium payoff can grow
  arbitrarily large as their share of initial funding approaches zero, and
  discusses implications for legal disbursement minima.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses the project's temporal dimension of giving
  norms. Shows that heterogeneous time preferences among donors lead to
  coordination dynamics where more patient donors should invest while impatient
  donors spend. This suggests that optimal giving norms may differ across
  individuals based on their time preferences, complicating simple universal
  rules like "give 10% of income." The asset accumulation through patient
  investment could justify asset-based rather than income-based giving
  triggers.

  POSITION: Core contribution to patient philanthropy literature; economic
  modeling of philanthropic timing with heterogeneous agents.

@misc{trammell2020discounting,
  author = {Trammell, Philip},
  title = {Discounting for Patient Philanthropists},
  year = {2020},
  howpublished = {Global Priorities Institute Technical Report},
  url = {https://philiptrammell.com/static/discounting_for_patient_philanthropists.pdf},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines what discount rate patient philanthropists should use
  when evaluating the timing of charitable expenditures. Argues that
  philanthropists who care equally about helping people now versus future
  generations should remove the pure time preference component (delta) from the
  standard Ramsey discounting formula. Under this framework, with historical
  investment returns around 4-7% and a philanthropic discount rate of only 0.5-
  2%, patient philanthropists could justify saving resources for decades or
  centuries before deploying them.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the implicit assumption in income-based giving norms
  (like tithing 10% of annual income) that resources should be deployed
  contemporaneously with when they're earned. If Trammell is correct, donors
  might better fulfill utilitarian obligations by accumulating assets through
  investment rather than giving from current income. This directly engages the
  project's question about whether asset-based norms better track utilitarian
  obligations than income-based norms.

  POSITION: Foundational patient philanthropy work; applies Ramsey discounting
  framework to philanthropic decision-making.

@book{madoff2023giving,
  editor = {Madoff, Ray and Soskis, Benjamin},
  title = {Giving in Time: Temporal Considerations in Philanthropy},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2023},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Interdisciplinary collection examining how temporal
  considerations shape philanthropic decision-making. Contributors analyze
  questions of giving now versus later, perpetual foundations versus spend-down
  approaches, intergenerational equity in philanthropy, and the role of time
  horizons in cause prioritization. Brings together perspectives from
  economics, philosophy, law, and philanthropy studies to examine the temporal
  dimensions of giving.

  RELEVANCE: Provides comprehensive treatment of timing questions in
  philanthropy, connecting to the project's investigation of when utilitarian
  obligations should be discharged. The collection's attention to legal
  constraints (e.g., payout requirements), institutional dynamics, and diverse
  time horizons illuminates practical considerations that might favor simpler
  income-based norms over more complex asset-based calculations requiring
  sophisticated timing judgments.

  POSITION: Edited volume surveying temporal dimensions of philanthropy across
  multiple disciplines; includes both patient and immediate giving perspectives.

  year = {2021},
  url = {https://www.globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Case-for-Strong-Longtermism-GPI-Working-Paper-June-2021-2-2.pdf},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "strong longtermism"—the thesis that the most
  important feature of our actions today is their impact on the far future.
  Argues that some actions aimed at reducing existential risks deliver
  significantly larger expected benefits in the far future than any available
  near-term action. Discusses the option of investing resources in sovereign
  wealth funds with longtermist missions rather than spending on immediate
  causes, noting that compound investment returns could compensate for risks of
  future misalignment.

  RELEVANCE: Extends the patient philanthropy framework to argue that reducing
  existential risk and influencing the far future may dominate near-term
  charitable opportunities. This challenges both income-based and asset-based
  giving norms that focus on addressing current poverty or suffering. If
  longtermism is correct, optimal giving norms might involve accumulating
  resources to deploy on civilizational trajectory changes rather than
  responding to immediate needs—a consideration absent from traditional
  utilitarian giving frameworks.

  POSITION: Philosophical case for longtermism in effective altruism; extends
  patient philanthropy to very long time horizons.

  title = {Maximal Cluelessness},
  journal = {The Philosophical Quarterly},
  year = {2020},
  volume = {70},
  number = {281},
  pages = {229--257},
  doi = {10.1093/pq/pqaa021},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruist cause prioritization rankings
  face a fundamental problem: the overwhelming importance and inscrutability of
  actions' indirect long-run effects ("cluelessness") combined with permissive
  decision principles for deep uncertainty (the "maximality rule") undermine
  confidence in orthodox EA conclusions. Demonstrates tension between
  longtermist perspectives, honest acknowledgment of deep uncertainty, and
  conventional EA cause rankings.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the decision-theoretic foundations underlying both
  patient philanthropy arguments and cause prioritization frameworks that might
  inform giving norms. If we are "clueless" about long-run effects, the case
  for sophisticated asset-based giving strategies informed by expected value
  calculations weakens, potentially favoring simpler heuristics like income-
  based pledges. However, this same uncertainty might cut against confident
  prescriptions of any specific giving norm.

  POSITION: Methodological critique of effective altruism's use of expected
  value reasoning under deep uncertainty.

  number = {4},
  pages = {493--516},
  doi = {10.1163/17455243-20180016},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that effective altruism's criticisms of "less
  effective" charities are inconsistent with EA's professed ecumenicity toward
  different moral views and evidentiary methods. Demonstrates that individuals
  may justifiably support charities other than those maximizing expected value
  if they hold different moral views, value personal connection, or have
  different risk attitudes. Effective altruists must either abandon ecumenicity
  or revise their critiques of non-optimal charities.

  RELEVANCE: Challenges the universalist implications of expected value-based
  giving frameworks that might support either patient philanthropy or specific
  asset/income-based norms. If different moral views and personal connections
  justify diverse giving patterns, this supports pluralism about giving norms
  rather than a single optimal formula. This is relevant to the project's
  investigation of whether one type of norm (income vs. asset-based) better
  tracks utilitarian obligations across diverse agents.

  POSITION: Critique of effective altruism's implicit moral monism and its
  implications for cause selection.

  volume = {22},
  pages = {93--120},
  doi = {10.1007/S10677-019-09979-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines the "systemic change objection" to effective
  altruism: that charitable interventions fail to address root causes and may
  perpetuate unjust systems, while systemic political change would be more
  effective. Evaluates whether revolutionary change or charitable intervention
  better satisfies utilitarian obligations, considering tractability,
  measurement challenges, and empirical evidence about the effectiveness of
  different approaches.

  RELEVANCE: Raises questions about whether giving norms should focus on
  charitable donations at all versus political activism or systemic reform.
  This connects to the project's investigation of how assets versus income
  relate to utilitarian obligations: if systemic change is more important than
  charity, perhaps neither income-based nor asset-based charitable giving norms
  adequately capture utilitarian demands. The article's discussion of
  measurement and tractability also informs debates about patient philanthropy
  versus immediate deployment.

  within consequentialist framework.

  journal = {Annual Review of Financial Economics},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {369--394},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-financial-101822-112948},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how missing market participants (constrained
  borrowers, future generations) affect the social discount rate. When market
  participants are missing, the population's average discount rate may differ
  from market rates. Missing current participants (e.g., constrained borrowers)
  implies average discount rates above market rates; missing future
  participants implies rates below market rates. Argues that legacy utility and
  intrapersonal discounting asymmetries (future selves discount the past, but
  not vice versa) may justify low social discount rates.

  RELEVANCE: Provides theoretical grounding for debates about appropriate
  discount rates in philanthropic decision-making. The analysis of borrowing
  constraints and missing participants connects to the project's focus on how
  asset versus income positions affect obligations: individuals with assets but
  constrained income might face different discount rates than those with high
  income but limited assets. The discussion of legacy utility relates to
  motivations for asset-based versus income-based giving.

  markets and intergenerational considerations.

  volume = {15},
  pages = {395--412},
  doi = {10.1146/annurev-financial-041123-123258},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews principles of financial economics for choosing
  discount rates in public and private decision-making. Critiques government
  practices of using borrowing rates as cost of capital, arguing for risk-
  adjusted approaches. Notes that for very long time horizons (e.g., climate
  policy), financial economics approaches become unreliable due to
  intergenerational concerns, uncertainty about projections, and the inadequacy
  of present value as a measure of value—requiring alternative decision
  criteria.

  RELEVANCE: Establishes limitations of standard discounting frameworks for
  long-horizon philanthropic decisions, relevant to patient philanthropy
  debates. The distinction between short-horizon decisions (where standard
  methods apply) and very long horizons (where they fail) suggests that income-
  based giving norms oriented to near-term impact might be more tractable than
  asset-based strategies requiring complex long-term optimization. However, the
  critique of using borrowing rates also applies to individual donors'
  decisions about consumption versus giving.

  POSITION: Methodological analysis of discount rate selection; identifies
  limits of financial economics for long-term social decisions.

  volume = {35},
  pages = {777--789},
  doi = {10.1007/S10460-018-9873-5},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Examines how effective altruism principles have influenced the
  animal protection movement, particularly through organizations applying
  cost-effectiveness analysis to compare interventions. Analyzes the spread of
  EA ideas in animal advocacy, including debates about cause prioritization
  (farmed animals vs. wild animals vs. animal research), intervention selection
  (corporate campaigns vs. individual outreach), and measurement challenges.

  RELEVANCE: Illustrates how expected value reasoning and cause prioritization
  operate in practice within a specific domain. The animal advocacy case
  demonstrates both the appeal and limitations of cost-effectiveness frameworks
  for resource allocation decisions. This is relevant to the project's question
  about giving norms: if cause prioritization itself faces significant
  measurement and value challenges, this complicates arguments about optimal
  timing and form of giving.

  POSITION: Empirical study of effective altruism's influence on social
  movement strategy and resource allocation.
