## Introduction

**Purpose**: Frame the research question within utilitarian theory and establish the significance of distinguishing income-based from asset-based giving norms.

**Content**:
- Open with Singer's foundational principle (1972): preventing bad outcomes without sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance. Note that Singer's abstract principle specifies no particular resource base---it could apply to income, wealth, or total capacity.
- Establish the practical gap: while utilitarian theory demands substantial giving, operationalization has converged on income-based norms (the 10% GWTC pledge) without systematic justification for this choice over asset-based alternatives.
- Introduce the core thesis: marginal utility considerations may favor asset-sensitive giving strategies, since assets beyond a security threshold serve primarily insurance, optionality, and positional functions with lower marginal utility than income directed toward ongoing needs.
- Preview the review's structure: theoretical foundations, marginal utility asymmetry, existing norms, property considerations, temporal dimensions, empirical feasibility, and research gaps.

**Key Papers**: Singer (1972), MacAskill (2019), Aloyo (2023)
**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 1: Utilitarian Foundations and the Demandingness Challenge

**Section Purpose**: Establish the theoretical basis for strong obligations to give while mapping the major responses to demandingness objections. This section sets up the need for operationalizable giving norms by showing that abstract utilitarian principles require practical specification.

**Main Claims**:
1. Utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to aid those in need, but the literature has focused on *whether* and *how much* to give rather than *from what resource base*.
2. Responses to demandingness (agent-centered prerogatives, cooperative principles, satisficing) provide frameworks for moderating obligations but leave open the income vs. assets question.

### Subsection 1.1: The Case for Strong Obligations

**Papers**: Singer (1972), Kagan (1989), Unger (1996), de Lazari-Radek & Singer (2013)
**Content**: Present the strongest utilitarian case for demanding beneficence. Singer's marginal utility framework (give until the marginal cost to oneself equals the marginal benefit to recipients) applies equally to income and assets but has been operationalized primarily through income. Kagan's rejection of agent-centered prerogatives and Unger's psychological debunking of intuitive limits suggest that conventional giving levels are far below what utilitarianism demands. Note that de Lazari-Radek and Singer's evolutionary debunking of self-interested bias might apply asymmetrically to attitudes about income vs. assets (evolved hoarding instincts may distort intuitions about accumulated wealth more than income flows).
**Gap Connection**: The demandingness literature assumes a general pool of "resources" without distinguishing their different marginal utility profiles.

### Subsection 1.2: Moderating Strategies and Their Limits

**Papers**: Scheffler (1982), Murphy (1993, 2000), Cullity (2004), Portmore (2011)
**Content**: Survey the major strategies for limiting utilitarian demands. Scheffler's agent-centered prerogatives allow agents to weight their own projects; Murphy's cooperative principle limits obligations to "fair share"; Cullity's life-altering demands framework identifies boundaries of obligatory giving. Crucially, note that each framework could generate different conclusions when applied to income versus assets. If assets are more closely tied to long-term life plans and security (Scheffler), if fair share should track total capacity rather than flow (Murphy), or if asset depletion is less "life-altering" than income reduction for the affluent (Cullity), these moderating strategies may support asset-based norms.
**Gap Connection**: Moderating frameworks have not been systematically applied to distinguish income from asset obligations.

**Section Summary**: Utilitarian theory generates strong obligations that require practical operationalization. Neither the demanding nor moderating positions have explicitly addressed whether income or assets provides the appropriate base for calculating obligations.
**Word Target**: 600-700 words

## Section 2: The Marginal Utility Asymmetry Between Income and Wealth

**Section Purpose**: Establish the empirical and theoretical basis for the central claim that income and accumulated wealth have systematically different marginal utility profiles, supporting differential treatment in giving norms.

**Main Claims**:
1. Wealth beyond a security threshold primarily serves insurance, positional, and bequest functions with lower marginal consumption utility than ongoing income.
2. Sufficientarian frameworks provide philosophical grounding for threshold-based treatment of assets.

### Subsection 2.1: Precautionary Savings and the Insurance Function of Wealth

**Papers**: Horioka & Ventura (2020, 2022), Painter et al. (2021), O'Donoghue & Somerville (2018)
**Content**: Present empirical evidence that wealth serves fundamentally different purposes than income. The "wealth decumulation puzzle"---retirees accumulating rather than consuming assets---demonstrates that wealth functions primarily as insurance and bequest vehicle, not consumption fund. Painter et al.'s finding that housing wealth operates through precautionary motives (marginal propensity to consume only 2.3%) directly supports the thesis that assets have low marginal consumption utility. O'Donoghue and Somerville's critique of standard utility theory suggests wealth's marginal utility is conceptually separable from risk aversion, further distinguishing it from income.
**Gap Connection**: This empirical work has not been connected to philanthropic giving norms despite its direct relevance.

### Subsection 2.2: Positional Goods and the Status Function of Wealth

**Papers**: Walasek et al. (2018), Shahar (2017), Halliday & Hankins (2020)
**Content**: Develop the argument that wealth increasingly serves positional rather than absolute welfare functions. Walasek et al.'s Twitter data showing luxury brand mentions increase with inequality demonstrates wealth's status-signaling function empirically. Shahar's philosophical analysis establishes that positional goods generate egalitarian concerns independent of prioritarian considerations. This positional dimension dramatically reduces the absolute marginal utility of excess wealth---one person's positional gain is another's loss. The implication: assets beyond security thresholds have even lower utilitarian value than standard diminishing returns would suggest, strengthening the case for asset-based giving.
**Gap Connection**: The positional goods literature has not been applied to philanthropic giving frameworks.

### Subsection 2.3: Sufficientarian Thresholds and Asset Treatment

**Papers**: Hassoun (2021), Huseby (2020), Bossert et al. (2021), Kanschik (2015)
**Content**: Provide philosophical foundations for threshold-based treatment. Hassoun's sufficiency threshold (what people need for autonomous functioning) and Huseby's two-threshold refinement (urgent needs vs. security) map onto the income/wealth distinction: income addresses ongoing needs below the lower threshold, while adequate assets address security at the upper threshold. Bossert et al.'s formal integration of sufficientarian and utilitarian axioms provides rigorous grounding. Kanschik's risk-based argument for progressive obligations based on distance from threshold applies directly to asset holdings---those with substantial assets face low risk of insufficiency, justifying stronger obligations.
**Gap Connection**: Sufficientarian frameworks identify thresholds but have not been applied to distinguish income from asset obligations.

**Section Summary**: Converging evidence from behavioral economics, positional goods theory, and sufficientarian philosophy supports the thesis that assets beyond security thresholds have systematically lower marginal utility than income, justifying differential treatment in giving norms.
**Word Target**: 700-800 words

## Section 3: Existing Philanthropic Norms and the EA Framework

**Section Purpose**: Critically examine the effective altruism movement's convergence on income-based giving norms (the 10% pledge) and evaluate whether this reflects principled choice or practical convenience.

**Main Claims**:
1. EA's theoretical framework is compatible with either income-based or asset-based norms, but practice has converged on income-based pledges.
2. Critiques of EA from justice, institutional, and political perspectives have not systematically addressed the income/assets distinction.

### Subsection 3.1: The 10% Pledge and Its Justification

**Papers**: MacAskill (2015, 2019), Singer (1972), Wilks et al. (2023)
**Content**: Trace how EA moved from Singer's abstract principles to the concrete 10% income pledge. MacAskill's definition of EA as using "resources in our possession" to do the most good is theoretically neutral between income and assets, yet practical focus has been on income. Note Wilks et al.'s finding that pledgers show distinctive psychological profiles (expanded moral circles, analytical thinking) but the study tracks income pledgers specifically---we lack data on asset-based commitment. The emergence of the Giving What We Can pledge as EA's primary commitment mechanism deserves scrutiny: is income focus principled or merely measurable?
**Gap Connection**: EA literature has not explicitly justified income focus over asset-based alternatives.

### Subsection 3.2: The Progressive Giving Challenge

**Papers**: Aloyo (2023), Schubert & Caviola (2024), Caviola et al. (2021)
**Content**: Present Aloyo's direct challenge to the 10% norm on four grounds, particularly the "net wealth objection" that giving norms should consider total resources, not just income flows. This is the most explicit engagement with the income/assets question in EA literature. Schubert and Caviola's psychological analysis suggests income-based pledges may succeed partly because income is salient and measurable, while wealth involves more complex psychological barriers (harder to calculate, more emotionally fraught). The psychological literature thus explains *why* EA converged on income norms without establishing that this convergence is *justified*.
**Gap Connection**: Aloyo's progressive giving proposal opens but does not systematically develop the case for capacity-based (including asset-based) norms.

### Subsection 3.3: Institutional and Political Critiques

**Papers**: Berkey (2018), Gabriel (2017), Dietz (2019), Lechterman (2020)
**Content**: Survey major critiques of EA to identify implications for the income/assets question. Gabriel's justice critique (EA sidelines equality concerns) and Lechterman's political critique (EA is depoliticized) both bear on the issue: income-based voluntary pledges represent an individualist, market-friendly approach, while asset-based obligations might require collective political action. Dietz's collective action critique suggests individual-level optimization may be self-defeating; coordinated wealth redistribution might outperform uncoordinated income-based giving. Berkey's defense of EA's openness to institutional reform suggests EA could accommodate asset-based approaches if evidence supports them.
**Gap Connection**: EA critiques address systemic change but not the specific question of which resource base should ground individual giving obligations.

**Section Summary**: EA's practical focus on income-based pledges is underexplained relative to its theoretically ecumenical framework. The movement's critiques and defenses alike have not systematically addressed whether assets warrant different treatment.
**Word Target**: 600-700 words

## Section 4: Asset Ethics, Property Rights, and Wealth Limits

**Section Purpose**: Examine philosophical frameworks for treating assets distinctively, including property rights theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism.

**Main Claims**:
1. Diverse philosophical traditions converge on treating accumulated wealth differently from earned income.
2. Limitarianism provides philosophical grounding for upper bounds on wealth that complement marginal utility arguments.

### Subsection 4.1: Property Rights and Beneficence

**Papers**: Murphy & Nagel (2002), Udi (2015)
**Content**: Establish the conceptual framework for obligations on property. Murphy and Nagel's challenge to pre-tax property rights argues that what one "deserves" can only be determined after specifying just distribution, removing libertarian barriers to asset-based obligations. Udi's Lockean reconciliation shows that even robust property rights frameworks accommodate preservation-based obligations---property rights and duties of charity both derive from the right to preservation. This convergence suggests asset-based giving obligations are compatible with property rights theory, not violations of it.
**Gap Connection**: These frameworks support obligations on assets but do not specifically compare income-based vs. asset-based giving norms.

### Subsection 4.2: Inheritance and Intergenerational Wealth

**Papers**: Halliday (2018), White (2018), Pedersen (2020), Bird-Pollan (2017)
**Content**: Examine asset-specific justice concerns arising from inheritance. Halliday's argument that unrestricted inheritance perpetuates "economic segregation" demonstrates how assets function differently from income in perpetuating inequality---assets compound across generations while income typically does not. White's refutation of the "double taxation" objection addresses concerns that assets are already after-tax income. Pedersen's comparison of income and wealth taxation on ability-to-pay grounds provides framework for comparing obligation bases. Bird-Pollan's finding that diverse philosophical traditions converge on wealth transfer taxation suggests broad philosophical consensus that assets warrant distinctive treatment.
**Gap Connection**: The inheritance taxation literature has not been applied to voluntary giving norms.

### Subsection 4.3: Limitarianism and Upper Wealth Bounds

**Papers**: Robeyns (2019), Timmer (2018, 2024), Kramm & Robeyns (2020), Axelsen & Nielsen (2020)
**Content**: Present limitarianism as philosophical foundation for asset limits. Robeyns's threshold (where additional wealth no longer contributes to flourishing) corresponds to the security threshold in the project's thesis. Timmer's distinction between zero-value and outweighed-value interpretations maps onto the question of whether assets have low marginal utility or are outweighed by others' needs. Axelsen and Nielsen's expressive injustice argument adds that extreme asset retention is itself wrong regardless of consequences. Kramm and Robeyns's historical survey shows limitarian intuitions pervade the philosophical tradition. These frameworks complement marginal utility arguments for asset-based giving.
**Gap Connection**: Limitarianism focuses on upper bounds and redistribution rather than comparing income-based vs. asset-based giving norms for middle-class donors.

**Section Summary**: Property theory, inheritance ethics, and limitarianism converge on treating assets distinctively from income, providing philosophical support for asset-specific giving obligations.
**Word Target**: 600-700 words

## Section 5: Temporal Considerations and Patient Philanthropy

**Section Purpose**: Examine how decision-theoretic considerations about giving timing interact with the income/assets question.

**Main Claims**:
1. Patient philanthropy arguments suggest that asset accumulation for later deployment may sometimes be optimal, complicating simple income-based norms.
2. Uncertainty and cluelessness considerations may favor simpler heuristics, but do not obviously favor income over asset norms.

### Subsection 5.1: The Case for Patient Philanthropy

**Papers**: Trammell (2020, 2021), Greaves & MacAskill (2021), Madoff & Soskis (2023)
**Content**: Present the patient philanthropy framework and its implications. Trammell's demonstration that philanthropists with low time preference should invest rather than immediately disburse challenges the implicit assumption in income-based norms that resources should be deployed contemporaneously with earning. If Trammell is correct, accumulating assets for later giving might better fulfill utilitarian obligations than regular income-based giving. However, note tension: this could justify *individual* asset accumulation but still leave open whether giving norms should track income or assets when giving does occur.
**Gap Connection**: Patient philanthropy addresses *when* to give but not the income/assets question about *from what base* to calculate obligations.

### Subsection 5.2: Uncertainty and Decision-Theoretic Limits

**Papers**: Mogensen (2020), Lim (2019), Lucas (2023)
**Content**: Present challenges to sophisticated expected-value reasoning. Mogensen's "cluelessness" argument suggests that deep uncertainty about long-run effects undermines confident cause prioritization, potentially favoring simpler heuristics. However, this uncertainty cuts both ways: it does not obviously favor income-based over asset-based norms. Lim's ecumenicity critique suggests different moral frameworks and risk attitudes may justify diverse giving patterns, supporting pluralism rather than a single optimal formula. Lucas's finding that standard discounting fails for long horizons suggests both patient philanthropy and immediate giving may face decision-theoretic challenges.
**Gap Connection**: Decision-theoretic critiques undermine sophisticated optimization but do not resolve the income/assets question.

**Section Summary**: Temporal considerations complicate but do not resolve the income/assets question. Patient philanthropy might justify asset accumulation, while uncertainty might favor simpler norms, but neither clearly favors income-based over asset-based approaches.
**Word Target**: 400-500 words

## Section 6: Empirical Giving Behavior and Norm Feasibility

**Section Purpose**: Assess the psychological and behavioral evidence relevant to implementing income-based versus asset-based giving norms.

**Main Claims**:
1. Behavioral research reveals that donors treat income and windfall/wealth differently, supporting the marginal utility asymmetry thesis.
2. Social norms significantly influence giving, but the intention-behavior gap and crowding-out effects caution against naive norm interventions.

### Subsection 6.1: Differential Treatment of Income Sources

**Papers**: Drouvelis et al. (2019), Andreoni (1990), Chapman et al. (2025)
**Content**: Present the crucial finding that bonus/windfall income generates higher donation rates than earned income. Drouvelis et al.'s experimental evidence shows donors implicitly recognize that different income sources have different marginal utility---supporting the thesis that income for ongoing needs has higher marginal utility than windfall or accumulated wealth. Andreoni's warm-glow framework helps explain why regular income-based giving may generate more psychological satisfaction than less frequent asset-based giving. Chapman et al.'s meta-analysis establishes that social norms influence giving (r=.18), with injunctive norms outperforming descriptive norms---suggesting that moral arguments about what donors *ought* to give matter more than what others actually give.
**Gap Connection**: The windfall income finding has not been applied to debates about giving norms.

### Subsection 6.2: Pledge Effectiveness and Implementation

**Papers**: Schmitz & McCollim (2021), Shang et al. (2019), Wilks et al. (2023)
**Content**: Assess evidence on the effectiveness of different commitment mechanisms. Schmitz and McCollim's analysis of the Giving Pledge (a wealth-based commitment) finds impact difficult to assess due to voluntary nature and vague timeline---contrasting with the measurable, regular structure of income-based pledges. Shang et al.'s finding that intention-behavior effects are 3-8 times smaller for actual behavior than stated intentions cautions against survey evidence on willingness to adopt new norms. The large gap suggests that binding, regular commitments (like income-based pledges) may be more effective than aspirational wealth-based pledges.
**Gap Connection**: Comparative effectiveness of income-based versus asset-based commitment mechanisms has not been directly studied.

### Subsection 6.3: Psychological Barriers and Design Considerations

**Papers**: Yoon & Woolley (2024), Howe et al. (2021), Grossman & Levy (2024)
**Content**: Identify psychological factors relevant to norm design. Yoon and Woolley's finding that incentive salience helps low-motivation donors but may backfire with high-motivation donors suggests heterogeneous norm design may be needed. Howe et al.'s demonstration that "working together" framing increases giving suggests asset-based norms should be framed as collective movement rather than individual compliance. Grossman and Levy's decomposition of warm glow into self-image and social-image components suggests income-based norms (more visible, regular) may better leverage social-image concerns, while asset-based norms may need stronger self-image appeals.
**Gap Connection**: Psychological insights have not been applied to compare income-based versus asset-based norm design.

**Section Summary**: Behavioral evidence supports the marginal utility asymmetry (donors treat windfall income differently) and reveals important considerations for norm design. Income-based norms may have implementation advantages (regularity, measurability, social visibility) that asset-based norms would need to address.
**Word Target**: 600-700 words

## Section 7: Research Gaps and Opportunities

**Purpose**: Explicitly articulate what is missing in the literature and how the research project addresses these gaps.

### Gap 1: Absence of Systematic Comparison of Income vs. Asset Obligation Bases

- **Evidence**: The demandingness literature (Domain 1) extensively debates *how much* to give but not *from what*. EA literature (Domain 3) has converged on income-based norms without explicit justification. Aloyo (2023) raises the "net wealth objection" but does not develop a complete alternative framework.
- **Why it matters**: Without systematic comparison, we cannot know whether dominant income-based norms actually optimize utilitarian objectives. If assets beyond security thresholds have lower marginal utility than income (as Domain 2 evidence suggests), current norms may substantially underutilize available philanthropic capacity.
- **How research addresses it**: The project directly compares income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions, developing criteria for choosing between them.
- **Supporting literature**: Singer (1972), MacAskill (2019), Aloyo (2023), Murphy (2000)

### Gap 2: Disconnection Between Marginal Utility Theory and Philanthropic Norms

- **Evidence**: Precautionary savings literature (Horioka & Ventura), positional goods theory (Shahar, Walasek et al.), and sufficientarian philosophy (Hassoun, Huseby) all support differential marginal utility of income vs. wealth, but none connects these findings to philanthropic giving frameworks.
- **Why it matters**: If the marginal utility of assets beyond security thresholds is systematically lower than that of income, utilitarian theory may generate stronger obligations on assets than current income-based norms recognize.
- **How research addresses it**: The project synthesizes marginal utility evidence with utilitarian obligation theory to derive implications for giving norm design.
- **Supporting literature**: Horioka & Ventura (2020, 2022), Painter et al. (2021), Hassoun (2021), Shahar (2017)

### Gap 3: Limited Application of Property and Limitarianism Theory to Voluntary Giving

- **Evidence**: Property rights theory (Murphy & Nagel), inheritance ethics (Halliday), and limitarianism (Robeyns) all address asset-based obligations, but focus on taxation and redistribution rather than voluntary giving norms.
- **Why it matters**: If philosophical analysis supports treating assets distinctively for taxation purposes, parallel arguments may apply to voluntary giving obligations, potentially strengthening the case for asset-based charitable norms.
- **How research addresses it**: The project extends property and limitarianism frameworks to voluntary giving contexts, examining whether the same considerations that justify wealth taxation support asset-based charitable obligations.
- **Supporting literature**: Murphy & Nagel (2002), Robeyns (2019), Halliday (2018), Pedersen (2020)

### Gap 4: Empirical Questions About Asset-Based Norm Feasibility

- **Evidence**: Behavioral research shows windfall income generates higher donations (Drouvelis et al.), but we lack direct studies comparing asset-based vs. income-based commitment mechanisms. The Giving Pledge (wealth-based) has unclear effectiveness (Schmitz & McCollim), while the GWTC pledge (income-based) has growing participation data (Wilks et al.).
- **Why it matters**: Even if asset-based norms are theoretically justified, they may face implementation barriers (measurement difficulty, lower salience, weaker social accountability) that favor income-based alternatives as practical optima.
- **How research addresses it**: The project considers both theoretical justification and implementation feasibility, identifying conditions under which asset-based norms would be preferable and strategies for addressing their practical challenges.
- **Supporting literature**: Drouvelis et al. (2019), Schmitz & McCollim (2021), Chapman et al. (2025)

**Synthesis**: These gaps collectively reveal that the dominant income-based approach to philanthropic giving norms lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives. The research project addresses this by integrating marginal utility theory, utilitarian obligation frameworks, property/limitarianism philosophy, and behavioral evidence to evaluate whether asset-sensitive giving strategies better capture utilitarian obligations than income-based norms.
**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

## Conclusion

**Purpose**: Synthesize the state of the literature and position the research contribution.

**Content**:
- Summarize the key finding: utilitarian theory generates demanding obligations to give, but the operationalization of these obligations through income-based norms (particularly the 10% GWTC pledge) lacks systematic justification relative to asset-based alternatives.
- Restate the marginal utility asymmetry: empirical evidence from precautionary savings, positional goods, and sufficientarian philosophy converges on the conclusion that assets beyond security thresholds have lower marginal utility than income directed toward ongoing needs.
- Articulate the research contribution: the project fills a significant gap by systematically comparing income-based and asset-based giving norms under expected-utility assumptions, potentially justifying a shift toward asset-sensitive philanthropic frameworks.
- Note practical implications: if the project's thesis is correct, high-net-worth individuals may have substantially stronger obligations than income-based norms recognize, while middle-class donors with limited assets may face appropriately weaker demands on their income.
- Acknowledge limitations: the analysis focuses on utilitarian frameworks and may not fully address justice-based, virtue-based, or other non-consequentialist considerations.

### Tone: Analytical, focused, building case for the research contribution. Emphasize:
1. The gap between abstract utilitarian theory and practical income-based operationalization
2. The convergent evidence for marginal utility asymmetry
3. The under-theorized nature of the income/assets choice
4. The potential significance of asset-based alternatives

### Key Tensions to Develop:
1. Utilitarian demandingness vs. practical feasibility of giving norms
2. Theoretical ecumenism of EA vs. practical convergence on income norms
3. Philosophical case for asset obligations vs. behavioral barriers to implementation
4. Patient philanthropy (accumulate assets) vs. immediate giving (from income)

### Where Novel Contribution Fits:
The research project's core contribution---arguing that asset-sensitive giving strategies may be favored under plausible expected-utility assumptions---should be positioned as filling Gap 1 (systematic comparison) by synthesizing insights from Gaps 2-4. The literature provides the building blocks (marginal utility theory, property philosophy, behavioral evidence) but has not assembled them into a unified framework for evaluating income-based vs. asset-based giving norms.
