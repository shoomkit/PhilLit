====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
AI safety research encompasses theoretical and practical approaches to ensuring AI systems behave safely and aligned with human values. This domain includes work on the alignment problem, scalable oversight, deceptive alignment, robustness guarantees, and existential risk from advanced AI. Key frameworks include inner alignment vs outer alignment, mesa-optimization, corrigibility, and interpretability for safety assurance.

Recent work emphasizes the challenges of aligning increasingly capable systems, including concerns about deceptive misalignment, distributional shift, emergent capabilities, and the difficulty of specifying human values. The field bridges technical ML research with philosophical considerations about value alignment, intent alignment, and what constitutes "safe" AI behavior.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides the conceptual framework for understanding what AI safety requires and where interpretability might fit. Papers here establish the target: what would count as a "safe" AI system? This is essential for evaluating whether MI is necessary or sufficient - we need to know what we're trying to achieve.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited consensus on what exactly constitutes "AI safety" - definitions range from narrow technical concerns (adversarial robustness) to broad existential concerns (preventing catastrophic outcomes). The relationship between different safety approaches (alignment, robustness, transparency) remains underspecified.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Use this domain to establish what AI safety requires. Distinguish different conceptions of safety (technical robustness, value alignment, existential safety). Note where transparency/interpretability appears in safety arguments - and where it doesn't.

KEY_POSITIONS:
[Will be determined from selected papers]

  note = {
CORE ARGUMENT: This position paper contends that modern AI research must adopt an antifragile perspective on safety -- one in which the system's capacity to guarantee long-term AI safety such as handling rare or out-of-distribution (OOD) events expands over time  Conventional static benchmarks and single-shot robustness tests overlook the reality that environments evolve and that models, if left unchallenged, can drift into maladaptation (e.
