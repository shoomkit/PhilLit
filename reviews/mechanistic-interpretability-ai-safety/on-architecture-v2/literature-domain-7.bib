====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain examines the broader ethical frameworks, governance structures, and
societal implications surrounding AI safety and interpretability. The literature
reveals three major themes: (1) the relationship between explainability and
ethical principles like fairness, accountability, and transparency; (2) the role
of interpretability in governance frameworks and regulatory compliance; and (3)
stakeholder perspectives on value tradeoffs between interpretability and other
safety measures. Recent work (2023-2025) shows increasing sophistication in
addressing tensions between transparency ideals and practical constraints, with
frameworks like LoBOX reframing opacity as governable rather than eliminable.
The field demonstrates growing recognition that interpretability serves multiple
ethical functions beyond mere transparency, including trust-building,
accountability, bias detection, and regulatory compliance.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain directly addresses the research question about how interpretability
relates to broader AI ethics principles and whether it should be prioritized over
other safety measures. The literature reveals that interpretability is valued not
intrinsically but instrumentally - as a means to achieve fairness, accountability,
and trust. This connects to the mechanistic interpretability debate by showing
how different stakeholders may value different aspects of interpretability for
different ethical purposes.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most work focuses on normative frameworks rather than empirical studies of how
stakeholders actually value and use interpretability. Limited philosophical
analysis of the conceptual foundations of different notions of trust and their
relationship to explainability. Insufficient attention to cultural variations in
ethical priorities and governance approaches beyond EU-US-China comparisons.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Emphasize the pluralistic nature of AI ethics - interpretability serves multiple,
sometimes competing ethical goals. Consider how mechanistic interpretability might
address specific ethical requirements differently than post-hoc explainability.
Highlight the emerging shift from transparency-maximization to governance-based
approaches that accept bounded opacity.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Explainability-centric: 4 papers - XAI as foundation for responsible AI
- Governance-based: 3 papers - Institutional accountability over technical transparency
- Trust-skeptical: 2 papers - Question whether explainability is necessary for trust
- Stakeholder-pluralist: 3 papers - Different groups need different forms of interpretability

  title = {Transparency and Accountability in {AI} Systems: Safeguarding Wellbeing in the Age of Algorithmic Decision-Making},
  journal = {Frontiers in Human Dynamics},
  year = {2024},
  volume = {6},
  doi = {10.3389/fhumd.2024.1421273},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Provides systematic review of transparency and accountability challenges in AI systems, identifying four thematic areas: technical approaches, legal/regulatory frameworks, ethical/societal considerations, and multi-stakeholder approaches. Argues that transparency and accountability are essential for safeguarding individual and societal wellbeing in algorithmic decision-making contexts, but current implementations face significant technical and institutional challenges requiring coordinated intervention across multiple levels.

  RELEVANCE: Highly relevant as it synthesizes current state of transparency/accountability discourse and explicitly addresses how these principles connect to wellbeing outcomes. The multi-stakeholder framework helps contextualize different interpretability needs. However, the review is broad rather than deep on mechanistic interpretability specifically, focusing more on governance than technical methods.

  POSITION: Integrative framework emphasizing need for coordinated technical, legal, and ethical approaches to responsible AI governance.

  title = {Explainable {AI} is Responsible {AI}: How Explainability Creates Trustworthy and Socially Responsible Artificial Intelligence},
  journal = {ArXiv},
  year = {2023},
  volume = {abs/2312.01555},
  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2312.01555},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that explainable AI (XAI) is not merely a component but the essential foundation for responsible AI across all dimensions. Demonstrates through systematic review that XAI techniques can address fairness (by exposing bias), robustness (by identifying failure modes), privacy (by revealing data dependencies), security (by detecting adversarial inputs), and transparency (by making decisions understandable). Concludes XAI is deeply entwined with every pillar of responsible AI, not just transparency.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses how interpretability relates to multiple AI ethics principles, providing evidence that explainability serves broader purposes than transparency alone. Supports the view that interpretability is instrumentally valuable for achieving various ethical goals. However, treats "explainability" broadly without distinguishing mechanistic vs. behavioral approaches.

  POSITION: Explainability-maximization view - XAI as comprehensive foundation for responsible AI across all ethical dimensions.

  title = {Trust, Explainability and {AI}},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Technology},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {38},
  doi = {10.1007/s13347-024-00837-6},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges the widely assumed connection between explainability and trust in AI. Argues that for some notions of trust (e.g., interpersonal trust requiring mutual recognition), explainability might be necessary but these forms of trust are inappropriate for AI systems. For appropriate notions of trust in AI (e.g., predictive reliability trust), explainability is not necessary and may even be counterproductive. Concludes that the standard argument for explainability based on trust is invalid.

  RELEVANCE: Provides critical philosophical analysis challenging a core justification for interpretability in AI safety. Raises important questions about what kind of trust is appropriate for AI systems and whether interpretability actually serves that goal. Suggests that some arguments for mechanistic interpretability based on "building trust" may rest on confused foundations about the nature of trust.

  POSITION: Trust-skeptical regarding explainability - questions whether interpretability is necessary for appropriate forms of AI trust.

  title = {Opacity as a Feature, Not a Flaw: {The LoBOX} Governance Ethic for Role-Sensitive Explainability and Institutional Trust in {AI}},
  journal = {ArXiv},
  year = {2025},
  volume = {abs/2505.20304},
  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2505.20304},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces LoBOX (Lack of Belief: Opacity & eXplainability) framework that treats AI opacity not as design flaw but as governable condition. Proposes three-stage pathway: reduce accidental opacity, bound irreducible opacity, delegate trust through institutional accountability. Argues that trustworthiness should be institutionally grounded rather than purely technical, shifting from transparency ideals to governance-based approaches that accept bounded opacity with role-calibrated explanations and stakeholder-responsive accountability.

  RELEVANCE: Directly challenges transparency-maximization approaches to AI ethics, offering alternative framework relevant to debates about mechanistic interpretability. Suggests some opacity may be acceptable if properly governed, which has implications for how we evaluate interpretability techniques. The role-sensitive approach aligns with pluralistic stakeholder perspectives on interpretability needs.

  POSITION: Governance-based framework accepting bounded opacity with institutional accountability as alternative to transparency maximization.

  year = {2025},
  volume = {abs/2503.11705},
  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2503.11705},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Presents Balanced, Integrated, and Grounded (BIG) framework for AI safety assurance. "Balanced" means addressing safety alongside privacy and equity, acknowledging tradeoffs; "Integrated" brings together social, ethical, and technical aspects traceably; "Grounded" roots approach in established safety practices while adapting to AI-specific challenges including frontier model capabilities. Emphasizes whole-system approach considering sociotechnical context rather than purely technical safety measures.

  RELEVANCE: Provides practical framework for how interpretability fits within broader safety case methodology. The emphasis on tradeoffs between safety properties and acknowledgment that interpretability is one tool among many directly addresses project questions about prioritization. Shows how interpretability requirements vary with risk level and context.

  POSITION: Sociotechnical safety framework emphasizing context-sensitivity and explicit tradeoff management in AI assurance.

  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews AI governance frameworks from technology companies, policymakers, and intergovernmental organizations, identifying key dimensions: accountability and transparency, explainability and interpretability, fairness and inclusiveness, privacy and safety, risk prevention. Argues that those involved in AI development have social and ethical responsibilities toward consumers and stakeholders. Emphasizes that governance requires addressing multiple dimensions simultaneously rather than focusing narrowly on any single principle.

  RELEVANCE: Provides comprehensive overview of how interpretability/explainability fits within broader governance frameworks across different stakeholder groups. Shows that interpretability is consistently identified as important but always alongside other principles, supporting view that it should not be exclusively prioritized. Useful for understanding institutional context.

  POSITION: Multi-dimensional governance framework treating interpretability as one essential principle among several.

  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2404.16244},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive analysis of ethical risks posed by advanced AI assistants across individual and societal scales. Addresses value alignment, wellbeing, safety, malicious uses, manipulation, anthropomorphism, trust, privacy, cooperation, equity, misinformation, economic impact, and environmental concerns. Argues for multi-dimensional evaluation considering technical capabilities alongside social, ethical, and governance dimensions. Provides recommendations for researchers, developers, policymakers, and public stakeholders.

  RELEVANCE: While focused on AI assistants specifically, provides valuable analysis of how interpretability relates to trust, value alignment, and user wellbeing in deployed systems. The emphasis on appropriate relationships and anthropomorphism connects to questions about what forms of transparency are ethically desirable. Shows complexity of stakeholder considerations in real deployment contexts.

  doi = {10.1145/3599974},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic mapping study examining how XAI has been studied empirically within AI ethics research. Finds that while XAI is broadly considered building block for responsible AI, most literature focuses on transparency dimension with less attention to fairness, robustness, privacy, security. Reveals research gaps in empirical validation of XAI's role across different ethical dimensions and lack of common framework/conceptualization between AI ethics and XAI fields.

  RELEVANCE: Provides meta-level analysis of how the interpretability/ethics relationship has been studied, revealing gaps between theoretical claims and empirical validation. The finding that XAI research focuses narrowly on transparency despite broader theoretical claims suggests need for more careful analysis of how different forms of interpretability serve different ethical purposes.

  POSITION: Systematic review revealing gap between broad theoretical claims about XAI's role in ethics and narrower empirical focus.

  year = {2023},
  pages = {1--7},
  doi = {10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191274},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Compiles catalogue of 10 notable tensions and tradeoffs between responsible AI aspects (privacy, accuracy, fairness, robustness, explainability, transparency). For example, increasing accuracy may reduce explainability; enhancing privacy may degrade fairness; improving robustness may compromise efficiency. Argues that operationalizing ethics principles requires acknowledging these tensions and making well-supported judgments rather than assuming all principles can be simultaneously maximized.

  RELEVANCE: Directly addresses core project question about whether interpretability should be prioritized over other safety measures. The systematic documentation of tradeoffs shows why blanket prioritization of any single principle is problematic. Particularly relevant is tension between accuracy and explainability, which maps onto debates about mechanistic interpretability in capable vs. interpretable models.

  POSITION: Tradeoff-acknowledgment framework emphasizing need for context-specific balancing rather than universal prioritization.

  doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2310.19852},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive survey of AI alignment field organizing around four principles (RICE): Robustness, Interpretability, Controllability, Ethicality. Distinguishes forward alignment (alignment training) from backward alignment (assurance techniques and governance). Treats interpretability as one of four key alignment objectives alongside other safety properties, emphasizing that alignment requires addressing all dimensions together rather than focusing exclusively on any single principle.

  RELEVANCE: Provides technical perspective on how interpretability fits within broader AI safety framework. The RICE framework shows interpretability as coordinate with other safety principles. Useful for understanding technical community's view of interpretability's role, though framework is quite broad and doesn't deeply engage with philosophical questions about value tradeoffs.

  volume = {6},
  number = {1},
  pages = {3},
  doi = {10.3390/sci6010003},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Surveys sources of bias in AI (data, algorithmic, human decision biases), their societal impacts (perpetuating inequalities, reinforcing stereotypes), and mitigation strategies (data preprocessing, algorithmic fairness, post-processing, transparency/accountability measures). Emphasizes that addressing bias requires holistic approach involving diverse datasets, enhanced transparency, accountability, and stakeholder collaboration. Notes particular concern about generative AI bias reproduction.

  RELEVANCE: Connects interpretability to fairness goals by showing how transparency enables bias detection and mitigation. However, suggests interpretability is means to fairness rather than end in itself. The emphasis on multiple mitigation strategies (not just interpretability) supports view that no single technique should be exclusively prioritized.

  POSITION: Fairness-centered framework treating interpretability as one tool among several for bias mitigation.

  volume = {5},
  pages = {1467--1480},
  doi = {10.1007/s43681-024-00490-x},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that AI safety claims are descriptive fallible knowledge claims rather than infallible guarantees. Proposes using Grice's Cooperative Principle and maxims (relevance, quantity, quality, perspicuity) to structure communication about AI safety to epistemically diverse stakeholder groups. Emphasizes that high-caliber communication of safety claims becomes vital given participatory nature of AI design and assessment, and that interpretability aids this communication but doesn't eliminate fundamental epistemic limitations.

  RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for understanding safety communication challenges in AI, showing how interpretability contributes to but doesn't solve the problem of conveying fallible knowledge to diverse stakeholders. The emphasis on stakeholder diversity and communication quality connects to questions about what forms of interpretability serve which stakeholder needs.

  POSITION: Epistemological framework emphasizing inherent fallibility of AI safety knowledge and need for high-quality stakeholder communication.
