RESEARCH QUESTION: Is Mechanistic Interpretability necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?

CONTEXT: This is an analytical philosophy paper addressing conceptual confusion in existing literature about:
1. The meaning of "mechanistic interpretability" (MI)
2. The role of MI for AI Safety

KEY TENSION: Two recent papers appear to have opposing views on what MI means:

1. Hendrycks, Dan, and Laura Hiscott (2025). "The Misguided Quest for Mechanistic AI Interpretability." AI Frontiers, May 15, 2025. https://ai-frontiers.org/articles/the-misguided-quest-for-mechanistic-ai-interpretability
   - Understand MI as activations of individual nodes or clusters in neural networks

2. Kästner, Lena, and Barnaby Crook (2024). "Explaining AI through Mechanistic Interpretability." European Journal for Philosophy of Science 14, no. 4 (2024): 52. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13194-024-00614-4
   - Include functional and higher-level explanations as part of MI (contradicting Hendrycks & Hiscott)
   - Claim MI is necessary for AI safety (abstract) AND sufficient ("MI enables us to meet desirable social desiderata including safety")

OBJECTIVES:
1. Clarify the definition of "mechanistic interpretability" - map out different definitions and conceptualizations
2. Assess the relationship between MI and AI Safety - evaluate necessity and sufficiency claims

SCOPE:
- Topic: Explainable AI (XAI), AI Interpretability, and AI Safety
- Target audience: Analytic philosophers and journal editors in philosophy of science
- Interdisciplinary sources: Philosophy journals + arXiv
- Time period: 2023-present (focus on recent literature)

EXPECTED DOMAINS:
- Mechanistic interpretability (definitions, methods, debates)
- AI Safety and alignment
- Explainable AI (XAI) in philosophy of science
- Philosophy of neuroscience/cognitive science (mechanism literature)
- AI ethics and responsible AI

Please create a detailed plan with:
- 5-7 research domains
- Key questions for each domain
- Search strategies (keywords, sources)
- Expected contribution to answering the research question
