Domain 4: Philosophy of Science - Mechanistic Explanation
Overview: This domain covers philosophical foundations of mechanistic explanation and levels of analysis. Papers address the new mechanistic philosophy (Machamer-Darden-Craver, Bechtel-Richardson, Craver), constitutive vs. etiological explanation, Marr's levels, multiple realization, functional explanation, and interlevel causation. These works provide conceptual frameworks for evaluating MI claims in AI research.
