## Key Findings in 60 Seconds

**Central Question**: Is Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?

**Answer**: Neither claim is straightforward—both depend on definitions and context.

### Main Results

1. **Qualified Necessity**: MI may be necessary for deception detection and inner alignment verification, but not for all safety properties

2. **Clear Non-Sufficiency**: MI is NOT sufficient due to scalability limits, understanding-control gap, and missing safety components

3. **Definitional Resolution**: Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025) vs. Kästner & Crook (2024) disagree because they define MI differently (narrow vs. broad)

4. **Practical Recommendation**: Use methodological pluralism—MI is one tool among many, not a complete solution
