Domain 5: Philosophy of AI - Conceptual Analysis
Overview: This domain covers philosophical analysis of AI systems, understanding, explanation, consciousness, agency, and opacity. Papers address what it means to understand AI, conceptual foundations of intelligence, the Chinese Room argument, Turing test, epistemic opacity, AI consciousness debates, and AI agency/autonomy. These works provide conceptual frameworks for analyzing interpretability claims.
