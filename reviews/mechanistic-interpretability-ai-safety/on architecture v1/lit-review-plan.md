# Literature Review Plan: Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Safety

## Research Question

**Is Mechanistic Interpretability necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?**

## Research Context

This literature review supports an analytical philosophy paper aimed at philosophers and journal editors in philosophy of science. The primary goal is to clarify conceptual confusion in existing literature regarding:

1. The definition and scope of "mechanistic interpretability" (MI)
2. The logical relationship between MI and AI Safety (necessity and sufficiency claims)

## Central Tension

Two key papers represent apparently contradictory positions:

1. **Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025)**: "The Misguided Quest for Mechanistic AI Interpretability"
   - Defines MI narrowly as activations of individual nodes/clusters in neural networks
   - Critiques MI's utility for AI safety

2. **Kästner & Crook (2024)**: "Explaining AI through Mechanistic Interpretability"
   - Defines MI broadly to include functional and higher-level explanations
   - Claims MI is both necessary AND sufficient for AI safety

## Literature Search Domains

### Domain 1: Mechanistic Interpretability - Definitions and Methods
**Focus**: Conceptual foundations and technical approaches to MI

**Key Questions**:
- How is "mechanistic interpretability" defined across different research communities?
- What are the core methods (circuit analysis, feature visualization, probing, activation engineering)?
- What constitutes "mechanistic" explanation in the AI context?
- What are the different granularities of analysis (neurons, circuits, features, representations)?

**Search Strategy**:
- arXiv (cs.AI, cs.LG) preprints 2023-2025
- Recent conference proceedings (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- Technical AI safety research organizations (Anthropic, DeepMind, OpenAI)
- Keywords: "mechanistic interpretability", "circuit analysis", "feature visualization", "neural network mechanisms"

**Target**: 10-15 papers

### Domain 2: AI Interpretability and Explainable AI (XAI) - Broader Context
**Focus**: The wider landscape of interpretability research and its relationship to MI

**Key Questions**:
- How does MI relate to other interpretability approaches (post-hoc explanations, attention mechanisms, saliency maps)?
- What are the philosophical and conceptual foundations of XAI?
- What trade-offs exist between different interpretability approaches?
- How do different stakeholders (developers, users, regulators) conceptualize interpretability?

**Search Strategy**:
- Philosophy journals (Philosophy & Technology, Minds and Machines, Ethics and Information Technology)
- AI/ML venues with interpretability focus
- Keywords: "explainable AI", "XAI", "interpretability", "transparency", "neural network explanation"

**Target**: 8-12 papers

### Domain 3: AI Safety - Frameworks and Approaches
**Focus**: The landscape of AI safety concerns and proposed solutions

**Key Questions**:
- What are the key AI safety concerns (alignment, robustness, adversarial attacks, deception)?
- What are the major approaches to AI safety (technical, governance, ethical)?
- How is interpretability positioned within AI safety frameworks?
- What are alternative approaches to safety that don't rely on interpretability?

**Search Strategy**:
- AI safety research organizations (MIRI, FHI, CHAI, Anthropic, DeepMind Safety)
- arXiv cs.AI, cs.CY (Computers and Society)
- Philosophy journals focusing on AI ethics and safety
- Keywords: "AI safety", "AI alignment", "AI robustness", "safe AI systems", "AI risk"

**Target**: 10-15 papers

### Domain 4: Philosophy of Science - Mechanistic Explanation
**Focus**: Philosophical foundations of mechanistic explanation and levels of analysis

**Key Questions**:
- What is mechanistic explanation in philosophy of science?
- How do different levels of explanation (mechanistic vs. functional) relate?
- What are the debates about reductionism vs. higher-level explanations?
- How do philosophical accounts of mechanism apply to AI systems?

**Search Strategy**:
- PhilPapers (philosophy of science, philosophy of neuroscience)
- Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
- Philosophy of science journals (Philosophy of Science, British Journal for Philosophy of Science, European Journal for Philosophy of Science)
- Keywords: "mechanistic explanation", "levels of explanation", "mechanisms", "functional explanation", "reductionism"

**Target**: 6-10 papers

### Domain 5: Philosophy of AI - Conceptual Analysis
**Focus**: Philosophical analysis of AI systems, understanding, and explanation

**Key Questions**:
- What does it mean to "understand" an AI system?
- How should we conceptualize explanation in the AI context?
- What are the epistemic limits of interpretability?
- What role does conceptual analysis play in AI safety debates?

**Search Strategy**:
- PhilPapers (philosophy of AI, philosophy of mind, epistemology)
- Philosophy journals (Philosophical Studies, Synthese, Philosophy of Science)
- Recent philosophy of AI anthologies and special issues
- Keywords: "philosophy of AI", "understanding AI", "AI explanation", "conceptual analysis AI", "opacity AI"

**Target**: 6-10 papers

## Search Execution Strategy

### Temporal Scope
- **Primary focus**: 2023-2025 (very recent work reflecting current debates)
- **Secondary**: 2020-2022 (foundational recent work if highly cited)
- **Exception**: Classic philosophy of science papers on mechanistic explanation (may be older but conceptually essential)

### Source Prioritization
1. **High priority**: Peer-reviewed philosophy journals, major AI conferences
2. **Medium priority**: arXiv preprints with substantial citations/engagement
3. **Lower priority**: Blog posts, technical reports (only if from major research organizations)

### Quality Criteria
- Conceptual rigor and clarity
- Engagement with philosophical debates
- Empirical grounding (for technical papers)
- Relevance to necessity/sufficiency questions
- Citation impact within relevant communities

## Target Outputs

### Quantitative
- **Total sources**: 40-60 high-quality papers
- **Domain distribution**: Balanced across 5 domains with emphasis on Domains 1 and 3
- **Temporal**: 80%+ from 2023-2025

### Qualitative
- Clear representation of competing definitions of MI
- Coverage of major MI methods and their limitations
- Comprehensive AI safety framework coverage
- Philosophical grounding in mechanistic explanation literature
- Explicit engagement with necessity/sufficiency arguments

## Synthesis Goals

The final literature review should:

1. **Clarify definitional confusion**: Map the conceptual landscape of "mechanistic interpretability"
2. **Analyze necessity claims**: Present arguments for/against MI being necessary for AI safety
3. **Analyze sufficiency claims**: Present arguments for/against MI being sufficient for AI safety
4. **Identify gaps**: Highlight areas where conceptual work is needed
5. **Position the research**: Show how analytical philosophy can contribute to clarifying these debates

## Success Metrics

- All major positions on MI definition represented
- Both technical and philosophical perspectives integrated
- Clear logical structure for analyzing necessity/sufficiency
- Actionable research gaps identified
- Citations validated and ready for academic use
- Suitable for philosophy of science journal audience
