# Literature Review Progress Tracker

**Research Topic**: Mechanistic Interpretability and AI Safety (Analytical Philosophy)
**Started**: 2025-12-21
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-21

## Research Question
Is Mechanistic Interpretability necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?

## Key Context
- **Conceptual confusion**: Different definitions of "mechanistic interpretability" in literature
- **Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025)**: MI as node/cluster activations
- **Kästner & Crook (2024)**: MI includes functional/higher-level explanations; claim MI is necessary AND sufficient for AI safety
- **Target audience**: Analytic philosophers, philosophy of science journals
- **Time period**: 2023-present

## Progress Status

- [X] Phase 1: Planning (lit-review-plan.md) - COMPLETED
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 1: Definitions and Conceptualizations of MI
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 2: AI Safety and Alignment Literature
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 3: XAI in Philosophy of Science
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 4: Philosophical Accounts of Mechanism
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 5: Technical Methods in MI
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 6: Critiques and Limitations of Interpretability
- [ ] Phase 2: Literature Search - Domain 7: AI Ethics and Responsible AI

- [ ] Phase 4: Assembly (literature-review-final.md)

## Completed Tasks

[2025-12-21] Phase 1: Created lit-review-plan.md (7 domains, 110-145 estimated papers)

## Current Task

Phase 2: Preparing to launch parallel domain literature searches

## Next Steps

1. Invoke 7 domain-literature-researcher agents in parallel for all domains
2. Monitor completion of BibTeX files for each domain
3. Update task-progress.md after each domain completes
4. Proceed to Phase 3 (synthesis planning) once all domains complete
