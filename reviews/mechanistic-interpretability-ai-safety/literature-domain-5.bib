DOMAIN: Interpretability for Safety - Empirical and Applied Work
SEARCH_DATE: 2025-12-22
PAPERS_FOUND: 14 (High: 12, Medium: 2)
SEARCH_SOURCES: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, arXiv, PhilPapers
====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers empirical work connecting interpretability to safety outcomes. It includes: using interpretability for debugging and improving models, detecting adversarial examples or distribution shift, building trust in safety-critical applications, and evaluating whether interpretability methods actually improve safety.

Recent work includes both success stories (interpretability helping find and fix bugs) and cautionary tales (interpretability methods being misleading or failing to improve outcomes). Key application areas include medical AI, autonomous systems, and fairness evaluation. Critical perspectives question whether interpretability reliably improves safety.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides empirical evidence (or lack thereof) for claims that interpretability improves safety. It's crucial for evaluating sufficiency claims: even if we can interpret a model, does that actually make it safer? And necessity claims: do we need interpretability to achieve safety?

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited rigorous evaluation of whether interpretability methods improve safety outcomes. Most work shows interpretability is possible, not that it's useful for safety. Few comparative studies examining safety with vs. without interpretability. The causal pathway from interpretation to safety remains underspecified.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Use this domain to ground normative claims in empirical evidence. Distinguish showing interpretability is possible from showing it's useful for safety. Note gaps between interpretation and intervention, understanding and control.

KEY_POSITIONS:
[Will be determined from selected papers]
