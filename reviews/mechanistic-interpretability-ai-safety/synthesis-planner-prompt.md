# Synthesis Planning Task

## Objective
Create a tight outline for a 3000-4000 word literature review addressing the research question:
**Is Mechanistic Interpretability necessary or sufficient for AI Safety?**

## Available Literature
You have access to 74 papers across 5 domains:
- Domain 1: MI Foundations and Methods (18 papers) - literature-domain-1.bib
- Domain 2: AI Safety Theoretical Foundations (16 papers) - literature-domain-2.bib  
- Domain 3: XAI and Interpretability Paradigms (14 papers) - literature-domain-3.bib
- Domain 4: Philosophy of Mechanistic Explanation (12 papers) - literature-domain-4.bib
- Domain 5: Interpretability for Safety Applications (14 papers) - literature-domain-5.bib

## Research Context
From lit-review-plan.md:
- **Central definitional dispute**: Narrow vs. broad definitions of MI
  - Hendrycks & Hiscott (2025): Narrow definition, critical perspective
  - Kästner & Crook (2024): Broad definition, necessity/sufficiency claims
- **Core question**: Evaluate necessity and sufficiency claims
- **Emphasis**: Definitional clarity, key debates, research gaps

## Target Structure
Create an outline for 5-6 main sections:
1. Introduction (500 words)
2. Defining Mechanistic Interpretability (800-1000 words)
3. AI Safety Requirements (600-800 words)  
4. Necessity Analysis (600-800 words)
5. Sufficiency Analysis (600-800 words)
6. Conclusion and Gaps (300-400 words)

## Requirements
- Emphasize **key debates and gaps** (not comprehensive coverage)
- Map **definitional landscape** clearly
- Identify **specific contradictions** with textual evidence needed
- Note where citations are sparse/dense
- Suggest specific papers for each section
- Target: Focused, insight-driven review (not encyclopedic)

## Deliverable
Create synthesis-outline.md with:
- Section-by-section breakdown
- Key arguments and debates per section
- Specific papers to cite (by citation key)
- Word count targets per subsection
- Transition/narrative flow notes
- Gaps to highlight
