## Completed Tasks

**2025-12-22 - Phase 1: Planning**
- Created lit-review-plan.md with 5 domains
  - Domain 1: MI Foundations and Methods
  - Domain 2: AI Safety Theoretical Foundations
  - Domain 3: XAI and Interpretability Paradigms
  - Domain 4: Philosophy of Mechanistic Explanation
  - Domain 5: Interpretability for Safety Applications

**2025-12-22 - Phase 2: Literature Search**
- Generated comprehensive BibTeX files for all 5 domains
- Total papers: 74 (target: 60-80) ✓
- Each entry includes:
  - Complete metadata (authors, year, venue, DOI, arXiv ID)
  - 3-component analysis notes (CORE ARGUMENT, RELEVANCE, POSITION)
  - Domain overviews and synthesis guidance
  - High/Medium importance tagging
- Files ready for Zotero import
- Coverage verified: technical and philosophical perspectives, advocates and critics

**2025-12-22 - Phase 3: Synthesis Planning**
- Created synthesis-outline.md with detailed section breakdown
- 6 main sections (Introduction, Defining MI, Safety Requirements, Necessity, Sufficiency, Conclusion)
- Target: 3000-4000 words, focus on key debates and gaps
- Identified specific papers for each section
- Established narrative flow and transitions

**2025-12-22 - Phase 4: Synthesis Writing & Assembly**
- Wrote complete literature review (literature-review-final.md)
- Final word count: ~5000 words (comprehensive coverage)
- All 6 sections completed with detailed analysis
- Key findings:
  - **Definitional clarity**: MI is not unified - narrow vs. broad definitions
  - **Necessity**: Conditional and context-dependent, not strictly necessary for all approaches
  - **Sufficiency**: Clearly insufficient - multiple decisive gaps identified
  - **Critical gaps**: Definitional clarity, empirical evidence, scalability, integration frameworks

## Deliverables

### Primary Output
- **literature-review-final.md** - Complete 5000-word literature review addressing the research question

### Supporting Files
1. **lit-review-plan.md** - Initial planning document with domain structure
2. **synthesis-outline.md** - Detailed outline guiding the review structure

4. **literature-domain-2.bib** - 16 papers on AI Safety Theory (BibTeX)
5. **literature-domain-3.bib** - 14 papers on XAI Paradigms (BibTeX)
6. **literature-domain-4.bib** - 12 papers on Philosophy of Mechanisms (BibTeX)
7. **literature-domain-5.bib** - 14 papers on Interpretability-Safety Applications (BibTeX)

### Quality Metrics Met

- ✓ Balanced technical and philosophical coverage
- ✓ Recent literature (2023-2025 focus)
- ✓ Both advocates and critics represented
- ✓ Clear gap analysis
- ✓ Specific, actionable conclusions
- ✓ BibTeX files ready for Zotero import
- ✓ Chicago-style citation approach
- ✓ Neutral, analytical tone

## Summary

Successfully completed a focused, insight-driven literature review on the necessity and sufficiency of mechanistic interpretability for AI safety. The review identifies definitional confusion as a core obstacle to evaluating normative claims, provides nuanced analysis of necessity (conditional and context-dependent) and sufficiency (clearly insufficient), and identifies four critical research gaps. The deliverables include a comprehensive final review and fully-annotated BibTeX files across 5 research domains.
