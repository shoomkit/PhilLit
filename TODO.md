# Ideas and Tasks

Developer notes for things to try, features to implement, and things to test.

Last updated: Jan 9, 2026

## Pending


## Done

- [x] add a markdown linter (just as we have a bib linter)? One problem: in merging the files, Claude may forget to add empty lines before ## section header. This happened in reviews/tradition-value-breakdown/.
- [x] Check that the SubagentStop hook filters out the relevant agent correctly. We do it via the sh shell script. But I seem to remember that there is a way to identify/filter subagent names in the hook definitions in the settings.json
- [x] literature-researcher skill: clarify location of where to write temporary (JSON) files from python scripts 
- [x] Update the documentation on how to run this skill in the Claude default cloud environment. (Esp. GETTING_STARTED.md). Complication: probably need to give Claude `.env` file. Not sure how to best get API keys into repo non-persistently preferably? Can a user drop `.env` or the keys in the chat? Less good (because adds keys to repo): Fork the repo, make it private, add the `.env` in the repo root.
- [x] Clean up CLAUDE.md: Don't need all these links to Claude documentation, Claude uses claude-code-guide agent when needed.
- [x] Have Claude check all the python scripts in philosophy-research/scripts
  - [x] Fix message logging again, which the refactor seems to have broken
  - [-] Make sure all the JSON files are neatly written to some `tmp/` again and not dumped in the middle of the repository. (NOTE: Claude seems to handle locations of temporary python script files well on its own without further instruction)
- [x] Test whether this project repo can be used in the Claude cloud through the app.
- [x] Clean / review all skills and agents
- [x] Assess test coverage and rigor. Evaluate whether we can expand to skills and agents.
- [x] Run tests. Encountered error earlier. Might need update CLAUDE.md
- [x] Cleanup: deleted unused `test_files/` directory (files were unreferenced)
- [x] Check that the hooks refers to absolute path to scripts with `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` variable as in `"command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/check-style.sh"`
- [x] Reconcile duplicate entries across different domain .bib files. Combined final .bib file often has duplicate entries. Not necessarily with identical keys.
- [x] Reduce use of conventions.md - simple instructions in agent definition instead (370 → 121 lines)
- [x] Consider domain-literature-researcher with Haiku ––– DONE. Decided against it. Stay with Sonnet. Not worth the risk.
- [x] Add instruction to stop agents from going rogue (e.g. if lit review agent decides to take over whole review?)
- [x] Remove use of `cat` in last phase of literature-review skill - inconsistent with agent role (should use Read, Write, and Edit tools)
- [x] Use SubagentStop hook to validate bib files written by the `domain-literature-researcher` agent. File encoding should be UTF-8, BibTeX syntax should be valid, no LaTeX commands for special characters should be used. See `conventions.md`
- [x] Manually review all agents and files - some are very verbose (e.g. ARCHITECTURE.md)
  - [x] ARCHITECTURE.md
  - [x] domain-literature-researcher.md
  - [x] literature-review-planner.md
  - [x] synthesis-planner.md
  - [x] synthesis-writer.md
  - [x] literature-review/SKILL.md
  - [x] philosophy-research/SKILL.md
- [x] Some reviews don't mention any literature. Synthesize maybe but not specific callouts.
- [x] Fix resumability via [resumable subagents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents#resumable-subagents) - not needed, current solution more robust
- [x] Work in reviews/ subfolder by default - added to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Replace WebSearch (high usage costs) with Skill - done: `.claude/skills/philosophy-research/`
- [x] Cleanup README - rewrote README.md, deleted .claude/agents/README.md, created GETTING_STARTED.md
- [x] Ensure lit researcher takes better notes (reminded to do that, need to check next time)
- [x] Add YAML front matter to final synthesis (helps with pandoc workflow)
- [x] Cleanup files at end of review - keep only validated bib and literature-review-final.md
  - synthesis-outline.md
  - synthesis-section-N.md
  - lit-review-plan.md
  - task-progress.md
  - unverified-sources.bib
- [x] Check permissions changes in Claude Code - suspicion: new version default is no permissions
- [x] Fix orchestrator forgetting last steps: aggregating bib files, moving intermediate files, adding YAML frontmatter (tried to address with manual edits)
- [x] Update documentation to reflect intermediate_files/ move
- [x] Improve agent namespace
- [x] adjust model: parameter to inherit
- [x] Try to parallelize agents again
- [X] Explain how users store API keys? Should offer an .env file (and read from in StartSession hook script)?


## Deferred

- [ ] Evaluate whether SKILL.md should be updated to encourage Claude to ask Users for direction and clarification about the literature review that they are looking or IF AND ONLY IF Claude assesses that a prompt is incoplete, vague, contradictory, over-ambitious, ambiguous, etc -- or if the prompt is otherwise defective. (NOTE: no new features now, Johannes has an implementation plan in his OmniFocus)
- [ ] Consider reintegrating editor and novelty assessor agents (DROPPED: too complicated, dilutes focus)
- [ ] Agent idea: based on .bib file, download PDFs of sources in final report, add path to PDFs in bib files (check first: does this allow for Zotero import?) (NO NEED: Zotero has this function: "Find Full Text".)
- [ ] Need a hook for auto compacting. What can we do to save progress when we run out of context? (Check first if this is really needed. We already have a resume logic)
- [ ] Do final review assembly with a hook and script? Sometimes it takes very long for Claude to do the final step (note: can't do, there is no Stop hook for skills)
- [ ] Use Stop or SubagentStop hook to concatenate bib files? (Same reason for why can't do as above: no Stop hook for skills)
- [ ] Unexpected behavior Writing Phase: `All 9 synthesis-writer agents completed. The agents drafted sections but couldn't write files due to permission restrictions. Now I'll create the sections directory and write all files, then assemble the final review.`
- [ ] Augment agents with skills for reading/writing .bib files or handling text files
  - https://claude-plugins.dev/skills/@K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills/citation-management
  - https://github.com/cadrianmae/claude-marketplace/tree/main/plugins/pandoc
- [ ] When done: convert literature-review-final.md to DOCX
- [ ] Remove task-progress.md updating - orchestrator now uses improved Claude-internal tool, tends to forget to update task-progress.md; earlier conversations can be resumed with /resume


- [ ] Check Anthropic docs for agent refactoring - some agents seem extensive (harder to steer, context expensive); could some be skills?

## Johannes' Debug Prompt

```
Now, help me debug. Check the whole literature reivew process in this session. What obstactles did Claude encounter (errors, lack of permissions, confusions and ambiguities)? Is there anything that could have gone better? 

Take your time evaluating the whole workflow progress. Keep a list of things that didn't work right or that could be improved.

Let me know if you require clarification or direction. If you are unsure or would prefer further information or access to other potentially relevant documents, ask the user. 
```
