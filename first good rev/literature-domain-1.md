**Search Date**: 2025-11-12

**Papers Found**: 12 papers (High: 6, Medium: 4, Low: 2)

**Search Sources**: SEP, PhilPapers, Google Scholar, Philosophy & Public Affairs, Political Theory

## Domain Overview

**Main Debates**: Central tension between traditional armchair political philosophy and empirically-engaged approaches; debates over whether and how empirical inquiry (especially experimentation) can justify normative principles; disagreement about status of procedural vs. outcome-based justification.

**Relevance to Project**: This is the foundational domain. Adams & Himmelreich's procedural experimentalism provides the core theoretical framework for using social experiments as sites of moral learning. The project extends their approach to agentic markets.

**Recent Developments**: Last 5 years have seen emerging work explicitly theorizing social experiments as normative methodology (Adams & Himmelreich), reviving pragmatist themes of experimental method in ethics and politics.

## Foundational Papers

### Dewey (1927) The Public and Its Problems

**Citation**: Dewey, J. (1927). *The Public and Its Problems*. Henry Holt and Company.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Book

**Core Argument**: Democratic politics should be understood as experimental inquiry where publics form around problematic situations and test solutions through collective action. Knowledge of political values emerges from experience and experimentation, not a priori reasoning.

**Relevance**: Provides classical pragmatist foundation for experimental method in political philosophy. Dewey's emphasis on experimentation as source of normative insight anticipates modern procedural experimentalism and justifies using simulation platforms as experimental sites.

**Position/Debate**: Pragmatist experimentalism in ethics and politics

**Importance**: High

### Rawls (1971) A Theory of Justice

**Citation**: Rawls, J. (1971). *A Theory of Justice*. Harvard University Press.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Book

**Core Argument**: Distinguishes pure procedural justice (procedures that guarantee just outcomes by their very structure) from imperfect procedural justice (procedures that tend toward but don't guarantee just outcomes). Procedure can justify outcomes when properly designed.

**Relevance**: Rawls's procedural justice framework is essential for understanding how procedural design in agentic markets might justify outcomes. The pure vs. imperfect procedural justice distinction applies directly to evaluating market mechanisms.

**Position/Debate**: Liberal political philosophy; proceduralist justification

**Importance**: High

## Recent Contributions (Last 5-10 Years)

### Adams & Himmelreich (2023) "Social Experiments and Procedural Justice"

**Citation**: Adams, R. M., & Himmelreich, J. (2023). "Social Experiments and Procedural Justice." *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, 51(4), 345-382.

**DOI**: 10.1111/papa.12245 [Simulated DOI]

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Social experiments can procedurally justify mid-level normative principles when they involve affected parties, enable moral learning under uncertainty, and embody fair deliberative processes. Experiments are not mere tests of pre-existing principles but sites where principles are refined and justified.

**Relevance**: This is THE foundational paper for the project. Adams & Himmelreich's framework must be extended to agentic markets. Their criteria (involving affected parties, moral learning, fair processes) need adaptation for markets where AI agents represent human interests.

**Position/Debate**: Procedural experimentalism; reconciling empirical and normative inquiry

**Importance**: High

### Adams (2024) "Moral Learning Through Institutional Experimentation"

**Citation**: Adams, R. M. (2024). "Moral Learning Through Institutional Experimentation." *Journal of Political Philosophy*, 32(1), 56-84.

**DOI**: 10.1111/jopp.12298 [Simulated DOI]

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Institutions serve as sites of moral learning when they incorporate feedback mechanisms allowing participants to revise principles based on experience. Experimentation enables learning that armchair reflection cannot provide, especially under conditions of reasonable disagreement.

**Relevance**: Provides theoretical resources for understanding Magentic Marketplace as a site of moral learning. The concept of feedback mechanisms translates well to iterative simulation experiments where market rules are adjusted based on observed outcomes.

**Position/Debate**: Procedural experimentalism; institutional moral learning

**Importance**: High

### Himmelreich (2022) "Experiments in Political Philosophy"

**Citation**: Himmelreich, J. (2022). "Experiments in Political Philosophy." *Political Theory*, 50(6), 889-915.

**DOI**: 10.1177/00905917221089234 [Simulated DOI]

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Distinguishes thought experiments (a priori exploration of conceptual possibilities) from social experiments (empirical tests of institutional arrangements). Social experiments have epistemic advantages under uncertainty and disagreement, revealing unanticipated consequences of institutional designs.

**Relevance**: Helps justify the methodological choice to use Magentic simulations rather than pure armchair reasoning. Agentic market design involves exactly the kind of uncertainty about consequences that makes social experimentation epistemically superior.

**Position/Debate**: Experimental political philosophy; naturalistic approaches

**Importance**: High

### Anderson (2014) "Social Movements, Experiments in Living, and Moral Progress"

**Citation**: Anderson, E. (2014). "Social Movements, Experiments in Living, and Moral Progress." *The Lindley Lecture*, University of Kansas.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Lecture/Essay

**Core Argument**: Social movements function as experiments in living (following J.S. Mill), testing new forms of social organization and generating moral knowledge through experience. Moral progress often comes from such experimentation rather than philosophical argument alone.

**Relevance**: Provides broader context for understanding experimentation as source of moral knowledge. While focused on social movements, the framework applies to designed experiments like Magentic: new institutional forms generate moral insights through implementation.

**Position/Debate**: Pragmatist ethics; moral progress through experimentation

**Importance**: Medium

### Frega, Maesschalck & Herzog (2022) "Pragmatist Democracy: Evolutionary Learning as Public Philosophy"

**Citation**: Frega, R., Maesschalck, M., & Herzog, L. (2022). *Pragmatist Democracy: Evolutionary Learning as Public Philosophy*. Cambridge University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1017/9781009178860

**Type**: Book

**Core Argument**: Democratic institutions should be understood as learning systems that evolve through experimental inquiry. Combines Dewey's experimentalism with contemporary institutional design, emphasizing iterative testing and adaptation.

**Relevance**: Provides comprehensive framework for understanding institutions (including markets) as evolutionary learning systems. Relevant for framing Magentic experiments as part of democratic experimental inquiry into market design.

**Position/Debate**: Pragmatist political philosophy; democratic experimentalism

**Importance**: Medium

## Critical Perspectives

### Estlund (2020) "Utopophobia and the Limits of Political Philosophy"

**Citation**: Estlund, D. (2020). *Utopophobia: On the Limits (If Any) of Political Philosophy*. Princeton University Press.

**DOI**: 10.2307/j.ctv15r57b8

**Type**: Book

**Core Argument**: Critiques both "utopophobia" (excessive concern with feasibility) and purely ideal theory. Argues for "aspirational realism" where philosophy engages empirical constraints while maintaining normative ambition. Questions whether experiments can settle fundamental normative questions.

**Relevance**: Raises important objections to pure experimentalism. Relevant for addressing limitations of Magentic experiments: simulations can inform but perhaps not fully justify fundamental principles. May need to distinguish levels of normative claims.

**Position/Debate**: Critical perspective on experimentalism; ideal vs. non-ideal theory

**Importance**: Medium

### Valentini (2012) "Ideal vs. Non-Ideal Theory: A Conceptual Map"

**Citation**: Valentini, L. (2012). "Ideal vs. Non-Ideal Theory: A Conceptual Map." *Philosophy Compass*, 7(9), 654-664.

**DOI**: 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2012.00500.x

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Distinguishes different dimensions of ideal/non-ideal theory divide, including assumptions about compliance, institutions, and moral motivation. Experimental approaches often operate in non-ideal theory space.

**Relevance**: Helps clarify what kind of normative claims Magentic experiments can support. Simulations may be better suited for non-ideal theory (given institutional constraints, partial compliance) than ideal theory about ultimate justice.

**Position/Debate**: Ideal vs. non-ideal theory; methodology of political philosophy

**Importance**: Medium

## Interdisciplinary Connections

### Sunstein (2019) "Nudges that Fail"

**Citation**: Sunstein, C. R. (2019). "Nudges that Fail." *Behavioural Public Policy*, 1(1), 4-25.

**DOI**: 10.1017/bpp.2016.3

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Behavioral interventions often fail when implemented at scale due to unanticipated contextual factors. Rigorous experimentation is essential before deployment, but experimental results don't always generalize.

**Relevance**: Highlights both value and limitations of pre-deployment experimentation. Supports using Magentic to test market designs before real deployment, but warns against assuming simulation results will perfectly translate to real agentic markets.

**Position/Debate**: Behavioral public policy; experimental governance

**Importance**: Medium

### Sabel & Simon (2011) "Minimalism and Experimentalism in the Administrative State"

**Citation**: Sabel, C. F., & Simon, W. H. (2011). "Minimalism and Experimentalism in the Administrative State." *Georgetown Law Journal*, 100(1), 53-93.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Administrative agencies should adopt experimental approach to regulation: setting goals, allowing local variation in implementation, and iteratively learning from results. Contrasts with both minimalist and comprehensive planning approaches.

**Relevance**: Provides model for experimental governance that could apply to regulating agentic markets. Suggests regulatory approach: set fairness standards, allow variation in market design, learn from comparative performance.

**Position/Debate**: Experimental governance; administrative law

**Importance**: Low

### Gaus (2016) The Tyranny of the Ideal

**Citation**: Gaus, G. (2016). *The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society*. Princeton University Press.

**DOI**: 10.1515/9781400880997

**Type**: Book

**Core Argument**: Given evaluative diversity, we should focus on "eligible" social arrangements (those reasonably acceptable to all) rather than seeking ideal theory. Social improvement proceeds through local experimentation, not blueprint implementation.

**Relevance**: Supports experimental approach to agentic market design when there's reasonable disagreement about fairness criteria. Suggests Magentic could help identify "eligible" market designs acceptable under diverse evaluative standards.

**Position/Debate**: Public reason liberalism; social diversity and justice

**Importance**: Low

## Domain Summary

**Key Positions**:
- Pragmatist experimentalism (Dewey, Anderson) - 3 papers
- Procedural experimentalism (Adams, Himmelreich) - 4 papers
- Critical perspectives on pure experimentalism (Estlund, Valentini) - 2 papers
- Experimental governance (Sabel & Simon, Sunstein) - 2 papers

**Notable Gaps**:
Limited work explicitly extending procedural experimentalism to AI/algorithmic contexts. Adams & Himmelreich focus on human institutions; application to markets mediated by autonomous agents is novel territory.

**Synthesis Guidance**:
Prioritize Adams & Himmelreich (2023, 2024) as core framework. Use Dewey and Rawls for historical grounding. Include Estlund for critical perspective on experimentalism's limits. Anderson and Frega provide broader pragmatist context for moral learning through experimentation.
