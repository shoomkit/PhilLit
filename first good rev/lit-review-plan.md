# Literature Review Plan: Social Experiments in the Agentic Economy

## Research Idea Summary

This project investigates procedural justification and moral learning in agentic markets (markets where AI agents transact on behalf of humans) through social experiments using the Magentic Marketplace simulation platform. Building on Adams and Himmelreich's procedural experimentalism, the research explores whether and how decision-making procedures involving AI agents can justify mid-level normative principles through controlled experimentation, addressing novel ethical challenges in autonomous market design before large-scale deployment.

## Key Research Questions

1. Can procedural standards of fairness or accountability be realized and evaluated within agentic markets?
2. What counts as procedural justification when decision-makers are non-human but represent human interests?
3. Do agentic markets exhibit moral pathologies analogous to those in human institutions (bias, manipulation, epistemic injustice), and can procedural reforms mitigate them?
4. Can social-experimental reasoning be extended to hybrid systems of human and AI agents, yielding new criteria for legitimate automation?

## Literature Review Domains

### Domain 1: Social Experimentation in Political Philosophy

**Focus**: Procedural experimentalism, social experiments as sites of moral learning, Adams & Himmelreich's foundational framework, relationship between normative principles and empirical inquiry.

**Key Questions**:
- What is procedural experimentalism and how does it differ from outcome-based political philosophy?
- How do social experiments function as sites of moral learning?
- What role does empirical inquiry play in justifying normative principles?
- What are the key debates around experimental approaches to political philosophy?

**Search Strategy**:
- Primary sources: Adams & Himmelreich's recent work on social experiments, SEP on "Experimental Philosophy" and "Pragmatism in Ethics"

### Domain 2: Procedural Justice and Legitimacy

**Focus**: Theories of procedural fairness, procedural vs. distributive justice, legitimacy of institutional procedures, fair decision-making processes.

**Key Questions**:
- What makes a decision-making procedure fair or just?
- How does procedural justice differ from distributive or substantive justice?
- What theories exist for evaluating procedural legitimacy?

### Domain 3: AI Ethics and Autonomous Agents

**Focus**: Moral status of AI agents, machine ethics, autonomy and agency in artificial systems, responsibility and accountability for AI actions, value alignment.

**Key Questions**:
- What moral status do AI agents have, if any?
- Can AI systems be moral agents or only moral patients?
- How should we understand autonomy and agency in artificial systems?

## Coverage Rationale

These eight domains provide comprehensive coverage by addressing:

1. **Philosophical Foundation** (Domains 1, 2): Procedural experimentalism and procedural justice theories establish the core normative framework
2. **Technical Context** (Domains 3, 5): AI ethics and multi-agent systems provide essential understanding of the technological subject matter
3. **Application Domain** (Domain 4): Market design gives context for agentic markets as a specific institutional domain
4. **Cross-cutting Themes** (Domains 6, 7, 8): Legitimacy/automation, moral learning, and simulation methodology address methodological and normative questions that span the project

This structure ensures both depth (foundational theories) and breadth (interdisciplinary connections), covering normative theory, empirical methodology, and technical implementation.

## Expected Gaps

Preliminary thoughts on potential research contributions:

1. **Extension to AI Agents**: Existing procedural experimentalism (Adams & Himmelreich) focuses on human institutions. Extending this to markets mediated entirely by AI agents is novel.

2. **Hybrid Agency**: Literature on AI ethics often treats AI agents in isolation or as tools. The project's focus on AI agents as representatives of human interests may reveal new accountability questions.

3. **Simulation as Social Experiment**: While simulation is used in ethics, framing simulation platforms (like Magentic) explicitly as sites of social experimentation for normative learning may be undertheorized.

4. **Procedural Pathologies in Agentic Markets**: Specific moral pathologies (manipulation, bias, epistemic injustice) may manifest differently in agent-to-agent interactions than in human interactions.

5. **Pre-deployment Experimentation**: The idea of experimenting with institutional designs before real-world deployment (avoiding "learning by harming") may be underdeveloped in both AI ethics and political philosophy.

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 8
- **Estimated papers**: 68-110 papers total (average ~10 per domain, with variation)
- **Key positions/debates**:
  - Procedural vs. outcome-based justification
  - Pure vs. imperfect procedural justice
  - AI agents as moral agents vs. moral tools
  - Efficiency vs. fairness in mechanism design
  - When automation is legitimate
  - Simulation vs. real experiments for normative insight
- **Time frame**: Mix of foundational classics (Rawls, Dewey) and recent work (last 10 years emphasized, especially Adams & Himmelreich, recent AI ethics, agentic economies)

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational works on procedural experimentalism**: Adams & Himmelreich must be thoroughly covered as the direct theoretical foundation
2. **Recent AI ethics and agentic systems**: This is a rapidly developing field; currency is essential
3. **Normative market design**: Bridging philosophy and economics for market-specific insights
4. **Critical methodological perspectives**: Understanding limitations/objections to experimental and simulation-based approaches

## Notes for Researchers

- **Interdisciplinary balance**: This project spans political philosophy, AI ethics, economics, and computer science. Seek philosophical depth while engaging with technical literature where normatively relevant.
- **Adams & Himmelreich priority**: Their work on social experiments is the direct foundation. Read all their relevant publications first.
- **Magentic Marketplace**: If any literature explicitly discusses Magentic or similar agent-based market simulation platforms, prioritize it.
- **Recent bias**: For AI/agentic economy domains, prioritize last 5 years due to rapid field development.
- **Philosophical rigor**: In technical domains (multi-agent systems, market design), prioritize papers that explicitly address normative/ethical dimensions, not just technical performance.
- **Google Scholar supplement**: For newer topics like "agentic economies," standard philosophical databases may have limited coverage. Use Google Scholar to capture emerging interdisciplinary work.
