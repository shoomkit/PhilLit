## Section 6: Synthesis and Research Gaps

 

The preceding five sections have surveyed an extensive interdisciplinary literature spanning political philosophy, AI ethics, market design, algorithmic governance, and simulation methodology. This review reveals rich theoretical resources for understanding agentic markets—economic institutions where AI agents transact on behalf of humans—but also exposes critical gaps where existing frameworks remain underdeveloped or inapplicable. This section synthesizes the current state of the art, articulates five specific research gaps that the literature leaves unresolved, and positions the present research project as uniquely situated to address these interconnected challenges.

 

### 6.1: Current State-of-the-Art Summary

 

Our review has established several key findings about what contemporary scholarship does and does not tell us about the normative evaluation of AI-mediated economic institutions.

 

**Procedural experimentalism provides a framework for justifying principles through experimentation, but only for human institutions.** Adams and Himmelreich's (2023, 2024) procedural experimentalism offers a sophisticated account of how social experiments can justify normative principles under conditions of uncertainty and reasonable disagreement. Their framework identifies three conditions for procedurally legitimate experimentation: meaningful involvement of affected parties, enabling moral learning through experience, and fair deliberative processes that treat participants as equals. This approach, rooted in Deweyan pragmatism (Dewey 1922, 1927) and contemporary democratic experimentalism (Sabel 2012; Knight and Johnson 2011), provides compelling alternatives to armchair political philosophy when evaluating novel institutions. However, this literature focuses exclusively on human institutions where people directly participate in experimental arrangements. Questions about whether and how these principles extend to AI-mediated institutions remain unaddressed.

 

**Procedural justice theory establishes fairness standards for institutional procedures, but not for representative AI agents.** The literature on procedural justice (Rawls 1971, 1974; Solum 2004; Christiano 2023) demonstrates that fair procedures have normative significance beyond their instrumental value in producing just outcomes. Procedural fairness requires meaningful participation, voice, transparency, and accountability—standards with both intrinsic and instrumental importance. Recent work extends these frameworks to algorithmic decision-making (Binns 2018; Raso et al. 2018; Kaminski 2019), establishing requirements for transparency, contestability, and human oversight when AI systems make decisions affecting humans. Yet existing frameworks address either direct human participation in procedures or AI systems deciding *for* humans. The distinctive case of AI agents acting *on behalf of* humans as representatives in competitive markets—where procedural justice might inhere in the representative relationship, agent design, market rules, or outcomes—remains theoretically underdeveloped.

 

**AI agents raise unresolved questions about moral agency, responsibility, and value alignment.** The AI ethics literature has generated extensive debate about whether AI systems can be genuine moral agents (Floridi and Sanders 2004; Wallach and Allen 2008) or are better understood as sophisticated tools (Johnson and Miller 2008; Bryson 2018), with Nyholm's (2020) "quasi-agent" concept offering a nuanced middle ground. The responsibility gap literature (Sparrow 2007; Santoni de Sio and Mecacci 2021) establishes that autonomous systems create accountability challenges when harm occurs, requiring careful institutional design to assign consequentialist, prospective, and virtue-based responsibilities even when retributive responsibility may be impossible. Value alignment research (Russell 2019; Gabriel 2020) reveals that aligning AI with human values involves technical, normative, and socio-political dimensions that cannot be resolved through engineering alone. However, these frameworks address AI agents as autonomous actors or collaborative partners, not as fiduciaries representing human principals in strategic competitive environments. How responsibility should distribute when AI representatives act in multi-agent markets, and how value alignment works when agents must simultaneously represent particular human interests and comply with shared institutional norms, remain open questions.

 

**Market design can balance fairness and efficiency through careful institutional engineering, but principles require adaptation for AI participants.** The mechanism design literature (Hurwicz 1973; Roth 2007; Abdulkadiroglu and Sönmez 2003) demonstrates that markets are designed institutions whose fairness depends on procedural rules, not natural phenomena. Matching market theory shows that institutional mechanisms can achieve strategy-proofness, fairness, and efficiency simultaneously through careful design (Budish 2011; Pathak and Sönmez 2013). Critical perspectives (Herzog 2013; Satz 2010; Sandel 2012) remind us that markets can be morally noxious when they exploit vulnerability or crowd out non-market values, requiring normative evaluation of what should be marketized and under what constraints. Yet this literature focuses on markets where human participants make decisions directly. How mechanism design principles—incentive compatibility, strategy-proofness, fairness constraints—apply when all market participants are AI agents rather than humans remains under-theorized. The multi-agent systems literature (Wooldridge 2009; Shoham and Leyton-Brown 2008) provides technical tools for analyzing strategic agent interaction but lacks normative frameworks for evaluating emergent market behaviors in terms of justice and fairness.

 

**Algorithmic governance requires fairness, transparency, and human control, but standards need specification for market contexts.** The algorithmic fairness literature (Barocas and Selbst 2016; Dwork et al. 2012; Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018) establishes that fairness is multidimensional, context-dependent, and cannot be fully automated (Wachter et al. 2021)—requiring human normative judgment about which differences are legitimate in particular contexts. Sociotechnical critiques (Selbst et al. 2019) emphasize that fairness is a property of systems-in-context, not algorithms in isolation. The meaningful human control framework (Santoni de Sio and Van den Hoven 2018) specifies that legitimate automation requires both tracking (understanding system behavior) and tracing (ensuring responsiveness to human values). However, this literature focuses predominantly on contexts where AI systems make individual decisions about humans (hiring, lending, criminal justice). What fairness, transparency, and control mean when AI agents mediate competitive economic exchange—where outcomes emerge from multi-agent interactions rather than individual algorithmic decisions—remains insufficiently theorized.

 

**Simulations can generate normative insights about institutional design, but validation standards for novel sociotechnical systems are underdeveloped.** The generative social science tradition (Epstein 1999; Axelrod 1997) and recent normative applications (O'Connor 2019; Fazelpour and Danks 2021) demonstrate that computer simulations can illuminate how institutional rules produce fair or unfair outcomes, enabling pre-deployment testing of interventions. Simulation epistemology (Winsberg 2010; Beisbart 2019) provides frameworks for validation through verification, validation, and sensitivity analysis. Minimal model methodology (Grüne-Yanoff 2009) justifies learning from idealized simulations that isolate causal mechanisms. Yet standard validation approaches assume target systems are empirically well-characterized, enabling comparison of simulation outputs to real-world data. For emerging sociotechnical systems like agentic markets that do not yet exist at scale, validation faces unique challenges: we cannot validate by comparing to real systems because we are simulating to understand systems before widespread deployment. What validation standards support normative claims from simulations of novel AI-mediated institutions remains an open methodological question.

 

This synthesis reveals a paradoxical situation: we possess sophisticated theoretical frameworks across multiple domains, yet these frameworks remain largely disconnected from one another and underdeveloped for the distinctive challenges of agentic markets. Procedural experimentalism addresses method but not markets; market design addresses institutions but not AI mediation; AI ethics addresses autonomy but not economic exchange; algorithmic governance addresses fairness but not multi-agent systems. The gaps are not merely disciplinary but substantive: existing work does not yet provide integrated frameworks for normatively evaluating AI-mediated economic institutions through experimental methods. Addressing these gaps requires both conceptual integration across domains and empirical investigation through experimental platforms that enable systematic study of agentic market dynamics.

 

### 6.2: Critical Research Gaps

 

Having synthesized the current state of knowledge, we now articulate five specific, interconnected gaps that existing literature leaves unresolved. These gaps represent genuine opportunities for intellectual progress rather than manufactured problems, and together they motivate the need for systematic research on the procedural justification and moral learning potential of agentic markets.

 

#### Gap 1: Extension of Procedural Experimentalism to AI-Mediated Institutions

 

**Nature of the gap**: Procedural experimentalism provides a framework for how social experiments can justify normative principles through moral learning under uncertainty (Adams and Himmelreich 2023, 2024; Himmelreich 2022). This framework has been developed exclusively for human institutions—workplace arrangements, democratic procedures, social policies—where human participants directly experience institutional rules and engage in deliberation about principles. Critical questions remain unresolved for AI-mediated institutions: What constitutes "meaningful involvement of affected parties" when humans interact with markets through AI agents representing their interests? How does moral learning occur in hybrid human-AI systems where much of the relevant behavior (agent strategies, market dynamics) occurs at scales and speeds that resist human comprehension? Can fair deliberative processes be maintained when some participants are artificial agents? Do the three conditions Adams and Himmelreich identify—involvement, learning, fair deliberation—translate to contexts where automation mediates human economic activity?

 

**Evidence for the gap**: The procedural experimentalist literature (Adams and Himmelreich 2023, 2024; Himmelreich 2022; Anderson 2014, 2016; Frega et al. 2022; Sabel 2012) consistently focuses on human institutions and social movements as experimental sites. No existing work extends the framework to contexts where AI agents mediate institutional participation. Anderson's (2016) analysis of "experiments in living" examines social movements led by humans testing new forms of social organization. Sabel's (2012) democratic experimentalism addresses human organizations and regulatory agencies. Even critical perspectives (Estlund 2020; Valentini 2012) that question experimentalism's scope engage only with human experimental contexts. The distinctive epistemic and normative challenges of experimentation when artificial agents are direct participants while humans are indirect beneficiaries remain untheorized.

 

**Why it matters**: Agentic markets are an emerging reality as AI systems increasingly mediate economic transactions. Without normative frameworks adapted to this context, we risk deploying institutions that fail basic tests of procedural legitimacy—involving stakeholders meaningfully, enabling collective learning, maintaining fair processes. The gap between experimental method developed for human institutions and the actual structure of AI-mediated markets threatens to leave us without principled ways to evaluate whether automated market mechanisms deserve public support. Moreover, if procedural experimentalism provides the most promising alternative to both pure ideal theory and unconstrained market libertarianism, its extension to AI contexts is crucial for developing legitimate governance frameworks for the agentic economy.

 

**How the research addresses it**: This research applies procedural experimentalism's core insights to agentic markets using the Magentic simulation platform. It investigates whether the conditions for procedural legitimacy that Adams and Himmelreich identify can be satisfied when AI agents represent human interests in experimental market institutions. By examining how affected humans can participate meaningfully (through agent design choices, market rule deliberation, and outcome evaluation), how moral learning occurs through observation of agent behavior and emergent market dynamics, and what fair deliberative processes look like when deliberation occurs at multiple levels (agent programming, market mechanism selection, result interpretation), the research tests whether procedural experimentalism can be extended beyond its original human-institutional context or whether fundamental revisions are required for AI-mediated institutions.

 

#### Gap 2: Procedural Justice for Representative AI Agents

 

**Nature of the gap**: Procedural justice theory establishes that fair procedures have independent normative significance, requiring features like participation, voice, transparency, and accountability (Solum 2004; Christiano 2023; Kolodny 2014). Recent work extends procedural justice to algorithmic contexts, identifying requirements for explainability and contestability when AI systems make decisions affecting humans (Binns 2018; Raso et al. 2018; Kaminski 2019). However, existing frameworks address either direct human participation in procedures (democratic deliberation, market exchange) or AI systems deciding *for* humans (hiring algorithms, credit scoring). A critical gap remains: what does procedural fairness mean when AI agents act *on behalf of* humans as representatives or fiduciaries in competitive environments? This representative relationship is distinctive—agents neither decide for humans (replacing human judgment) nor act alongside humans (hybrid decision-making) but rather represent human interests in transactions with other agents. How should procedural fairness standards apply to this representative agency structure?

 

**Evidence for the gap**: Buchak's (2017) analysis of the proxy problem—that procedural justice requires proxies be justifiable, not merely accurate—hints at this challenge but does not develop frameworks for multi-agent competitive contexts where agents use preference models as proxies for human values. Christiano (2023) addresses legitimacy requiring fair procedures but focuses on human political participation. Binns (2018) examines algorithmic accountability but in contexts where algorithms decide about humans, not on behalf of humans in agent-to-agent transactions. The procedural justice literature's treatment of representation focuses on human representatives (trustees, delegates, democratic officials) with established legal and moral frameworks for fiduciary duties. How these frameworks should adapt when representatives are artificial, when representation occurs in competitive rather than cooperative contexts, and when multiple agents represent conflicting interests simultaneously, remains unaddressed.

 

**Why it matters**: The representative relationship between humans and their AI agents is central to agentic markets' legitimacy. If agents fail to represent human interests faithfully—pursuing objectives that diverge from what users reflectively endorse, lacking transparency about strategies, or proving unresponsive to corrective feedback—then markets mediated by such agents lack procedural legitimacy even if outcomes happen to be distributively fair. Conversely, if procedural fairness can be achieved through appropriate design of the representative relationship (preference elicitation mechanisms, oversight capabilities, intervention rights, transparency requirements), then agentic markets might satisfy demanding standards of procedural justice. Without frameworks specifying what procedural fairness requires in representative AI agency contexts, we cannot distinguish legitimate from illegitimate forms of market automation.

 

**How the research addresses it**: This research develops and tests procedural justice standards specifically for representative AI agents in competitive markets. It examines what fairness requires at multiple levels: the agent design level (how agents learn and represent human preferences), the market mechanism level (trading rules, information disclosure requirements, manipulation prohibitions), and the oversight level (human intervention capabilities, appeal mechanisms, accountability structures). Through Magentic experiments that systematically vary these procedural features while observing effects on both outcomes and perceived legitimacy, the research investigates whether procedural fairness can be realized when AI agents mediate economic exchange, and what institutional safeguards are necessary to prevent domination, ensure meaningful human control, and maintain the procedural values that legitimacy requires.

 

#### Gap 3: Moral Pathologies in Agent-to-Agent Interactions

 

**Nature of the gap**: The algorithmic fairness literature extensively documents how AI systems can exhibit bias, discrimination, and disparate impact when making decisions about humans (Barocas and Selbst 2016; Dwork et al. 2012; Eubanks 2018; Noble 2018). The multi-agent systems literature analyzes coordination challenges, cooperation dynamics, and emergent behaviors in systems where multiple AI agents interact (Wooldridge 2009; Leibo et al. 2017; Dafoe et al. 2020). Yet no synthesis addresses whether and how agent-to-agent interactions in market contexts exhibit distinctive moral pathologies—forms of unfairness, manipulation, epistemic injustice, or exploitation that arise specifically from algorithmic agents transacting with one another on behalf of humans. Do agentic markets produce novel forms of injustice not present in human-only or hybrid human-AI markets? Can agents learn to exploit systematic vulnerabilities in other agents' strategies? Might agent interactions produce emergent discriminatory patterns even when individual agents are designed without bias? How do information asymmetries, learning dynamics, and strategic sophistication differences among agents affect market fairness?

 

**Evidence for the gap**: The algorithmic fairness literature (Selbst et al. 2019; Wachter et al. 2021; Corbett-Davies and Goel 2018) focuses on AI-to-human decisions—algorithmic systems classifying, ranking, or allocating resources to human subjects. Even sociotechnical critiques emphasizing contextual analysis (Selbst et al. 2019) examine contexts where humans are decision subjects, not where agents mediate human interactions. The multi-agent systems literature studies emergent cooperation and competition (Leibo et al. 2017; Hughes et al. 2018; Crandall et al. 2018) but does not frame findings in normative terms of justice, fairness, or legitimacy. Dafoe et al. (2020) identify cooperation challenges in multi-agent AI but focus on technical coordination problems rather than market-specific pathologies like manipulation, front-running, or strategic discrimination. The connection between emergent multi-agent behaviors and normative evaluation criteria remains underdeveloped.

 

**Why it matters**: If agent-to-agent market interactions produce distinctive moral pathologies—forms of unfairness that emerge specifically from algorithmic intermediation—then existing fairness frameworks developed for human markets or AI-to-human decisions may prove inadequate. Agentic markets might appear procedurally fair by traditional standards while exhibiting novel forms of algorithmic injustice visible only through study of agent interaction dynamics. Conversely, concerns about algorithmic bias might prove less severe in agent-to-agent contexts if certain pathologies (stereotyping, dehumanization) require human subjects. Without empirical investigation of actual agent behavior in market contexts, normative theory risks being either too optimistic (assuming human-market fairness principles automatically transfer) or too pessimistic (assuming automation inevitably produces injustice).

 

**How the research addresses it**: This research empirically examines whether agentic markets exhibit moral pathologies through systematic experimentation with agent interactions under varying market rules. By observing agent behavior in controlled market simulations, the research investigates whether agents develop manipulative strategies, whether strategic sophistication differences create exploitative dynamics, whether learning algorithms produce discriminatory patterns in resource allocation, and whether information asymmetries enable systematic advantage-taking. Importantly, the research tests whether procedural interventions—transparency requirements, strategy constraints, fairness-aware agent design, market oversight mechanisms—can mitigate identified pathologies. This combination of empirical investigation and normative evaluation addresses the gap by making visible the distinctive justice challenges of agent-to-agent market transactions and testing institutional solutions.

 

#### Gap 4: Normative Validation for Agentic Economy Simulations

 

**Nature of the gap**: Simulation epistemology has developed sophisticated validation frameworks emphasizing verification (code correctness), validation (model adequacy), and sensitivity analysis (robustness testing) as necessary for epistemic credibility (Winsberg 2010; Beisbart 2019). Recent work demonstrates that simulations can provide normative insights when properly designed and validated (Epstein 1999; O'Connor 2019; Fazelpour and Danks 2021). However, standard validation approaches assume the target system is empirically well-characterized, enabling comparison of simulation outputs to real-world data. Agentic markets present a distinctive validation challenge: they are emerging sociotechnical systems that do not yet exist at scale. While AI trading agents exist in limited contexts (algorithmic trading, automated bidding), fully agent-mediated markets where diverse AI agents represent heterogeneous human principals remain largely hypothetical. This creates a validation paradox: we cannot validate by comparing to real systems because we are simulating precisely to understand systems before widespread deployment. What validation standards support normative claims from simulations of sociotechnical systems that are themselves still emerging?

 

**Evidence for the gap**: Simulation epistemology literature (Winsberg 2010; Beisbart 2019; Grüne-Yanoff 2009) provides general validation frameworks but does not specifically address validation for emerging sociotechnical systems where empirical comparison is impossible. Beisbart (2019) emphasizes purpose-relative validation but does not develop specific criteria for normative simulations of novel institutional arrangements. Grüne-Yanoff (2009) defends minimal models that isolate causal mechanisms but does not specify which mechanisms are essential for normative properties like fairness or legitimacy to transfer from simulation to target. Dardashti et al. (2019) analyze analogue simulation and knowledge transfer through structural similarity but focus on physical systems, not sociotechnical institutions. The epistemic standards for pre-deployment simulation of AI-mediated institutional arrangements—where we seek normative insight about systems that are themselves being designed—remain under-specified.

 

**Why it matters**: The promise of simulation-based normative inquiry depends on establishing credible validation standards. If simulations of agentic markets lack epistemic credibility, their normative insights cannot inform institutional design or public policy. Conversely, if appropriate validation standards can be developed—standards that do not require impossible empirical comparison but nonetheless ensure simulations capture normatively relevant causal structures—then simulation platforms like Magentic can enable moral learning about agentic market design before widespread real-world deployment. This matters practically because deployment without pre-deployment testing risks learning-by-harming: discovering pathologies only after real markets affect real people. It matters methodologically because the validation challenge for agentic economy simulations instantiates a broader problem: how to validate normative claims about emerging sociotechnical systems generally.

 

**How the research addresses it**: This research develops validation criteria specifically for normative simulations of agentic markets, drawing on but extending existing simulation epistemology. The validation framework focuses on three dimensions: structural validation (ensuring Magentic preserves the institutional mechanisms through which market rules affect fairness-relevant outcomes—information flows, strategic incentives, coordination challenges), counterfactual validation (testing whether simulations respond to institutional interventions as theory predicts—whether transparency requirements reduce information asymmetry, whether fairness constraints affect efficiency as mechanism design theory suggests), and sensitivity analysis (examining robustness of normative findings to parameter variations and modeling choices). Rather than requiring empirical match with real agentic markets, validation establishes that the simulation captures the causally relevant institutional structure for the normative properties under investigation. This purpose-relative, structure-focused validation approach offers a methodological contribution beyond the specific agentic market context, providing a model for validating normative simulations of emerging sociotechnical systems generally.

 

#### Gap 5: Pre-deployment Moral Learning

 

**Nature of the gap**: The institutional learning literature establishes that experimentation enables moral learning about institutional design (Dewey 1922; Anderson 2016; Sabel 2012), and experimental governance frameworks advocate testing interventions before full implementation (Sunstein 2019; Sabel and Simon 2011). However, this literature focuses on real-world experiments with actual human participants and stakeholders. Real-world experimentation with agentic markets, however, poses significant risks: market crashes could destroy wealth, manipulation could harm vulnerable users, discriminatory patterns could entrench inequality, and trust erosion could undermine economic institutions broadly. These risks suggest real-world experimentation may be ethically problematic or politically infeasible at scales sufficient for learning. Conversely, purely theoretical analysis faces epistemic limitations—multi-agent market dynamics are sufficiently complex that armchair reasoning cannot reliably predict emergent behaviors. A critical gap thus emerges: we need moral learning about agentic market design before widespread deployment to avoid learning-by-harming, yet we lack frameworks for how such pre-deployment moral learning should occur through simulation rather than real-world experimentation.

 

**Evidence for the gap**: Anderson's (2016) analysis of moral learning through "experiments in living" focuses on actual social movements (abolition, women's suffrage, labor organizing) that demonstrated feasibility of alternative arrangements through real-world instantiation. Sabel's (2012) democratic experimentalism addresses regulatory agencies conducting real-world trials with monitoring and feedback. Sunstein's (2019) discussion of "nudges that fail" analyzes real behavioral interventions and their unexpected consequences, advocating for experimental testing but focusing on actual policy trials. The institutional learning literature has not developed frameworks specifically for pre-deployment simulation as a form of moral learning—for using computational models to generate normative insights before real-world implementation. While O'Connor (2019) and Fazelpour and Danks (2021) demonstrate simulation's normative potential, they do not position simulation explicitly as enabling moral learning that real-world experimentation cannot safely provide.

 

**Why it matters**: As AI systems increasingly mediate economic and social institutions, we face a fundamental choice: deploy and hope for the best, deriving principles from whatever consequences emerge (learning-by-harming); restrict automation to avoid risks, foregoing potential benefits (precautionary paralysis); or develop methods for pre-deployment moral learning that generate normative insights without real-world harms (simulation-based experimental inquiry). The third path requires justifying simulation as a form of moral learning comparable to but distinct from both traditional philosophy (armchair reasoning about principles) and experimental governance (real-world institutional trials). Without such justification, we lack methodological foundations for responsible innovation in agentic economies—unable to learn what fairness requires before deployment but unable to deploy safely without such learning.

 

**How the research addresses it**: This research positions simulation-based experimentation as enabling pre-deployment moral learning about agentic market design. It demonstrates how computational simulation can provide a form of moral learning that combines philosophical rigor (precise specification of normative concepts, systematic variation of institutional parameters) with empirical investigation (observation of actual agent behaviors, discovery of emergent market dynamics) while avoiding the harms of premature real-world deployment. The Magentic platform enables what might be called "virtual experiments in living"—systematic exploration of alternative institutional arrangements that makes different market designs tangible and evaluable without affecting real economic welfare. By documenting the epistemic process through which simulation generates normative insights (observation of emergent pathologies, testing of procedural interventions, refinement of fairness principles based on simulation evidence), the research provides methodological foundations for pre-deployment moral learning about emerging sociotechnical systems. This approach offers a middle path between excessive caution (refusing automation until all questions are resolved) and reckless deployment (learning only through real-world harms), enabling responsible innovation through simulation-based experimental inquiry.

 

### 6.3: Project Positioning

 

The research project is uniquely positioned to address these interconnected gaps through an integrated methodological approach that combines philosophical framework development with computational experimentation. The project's positioning can be understood across four dimensions: philosophical foundation, ethical framework, institutional design methodology, and methodological innovation.

 

**Philosophical foundation: Extending procedural experimentalism to AI-mediated contexts.** The project takes Adams and Himmelreich's (2023, 2024) procedural experimentalism as its normative foundation but extends the framework to contexts where AI agents mediate institutional participation. While Adams and Himmelreich establish that social experiments can justify principles through moral learning when they involve affected parties, enable learning under uncertainty, and embody fair deliberative processes, they focus exclusively on human institutions. This research operationalizes their framework for agentic markets by: (1) specifying what "involving affected parties" means when humans participate through AI representatives (examining participation at multiple levels: preference expression, agent oversight, market rule deliberation); (2) analyzing how moral learning occurs in hybrid human-AI experimental contexts (investigating whether humans can learn normatively relevant lessons from observing agent behavior and emergent market dynamics); and (3) developing standards for fair deliberative processes when deliberation occurs across human and artificial participants (procedural fairness in representative relationships, market mechanisms, and outcome evaluation).

 

**Ethical framework: Addressing responsibility gaps and value alignment in representative multi-agent systems.** The project engages with AI ethics literature on moral agency, responsibility attribution, and value alignment (Russell 2019; Gabriel 2020; Santoni de Sio and Mecacci 2021; Nyholm 2020) but focuses specifically on the under-theorized case of representative AI agents in competitive contexts. By examining how responsibility should distribute when AI agents act as fiduciaries in markets (investigating consequentialist, prospective, and virtue-based responsibility in agent-mediated transactions), how value alignment works when agents must simultaneously represent particular human interests and comply with shared market norms (testing whether agents can be both faithful representatives and fair market participants), and whether agentic markets create distinctive moral pathologies in agent-to-agent interactions (empirically studying manipulation, discrimination, and exploitation in automated markets), the research addresses responsibility and alignment challenges specific to AI-mediated economic institutions.

 

**Institutional design methodology: Applying mechanism design to agentic markets with fairness constraints.** The project draws on market design and mechanism theory (Hurwicz 1973; Roth 2007; Abdulkadiroglu and Sönmez 2003) but adapts these frameworks for markets where all participants are AI agents representing humans. The research investigates whether principles developed for human markets—strategy-proofness, incentive compatibility, fairness constraints—apply when participants are algorithms that can be programmed with arbitrary strategies and learn through interaction. It tests whether market mechanisms can achieve both efficiency and fairness when agents have heterogeneous capabilities (sophisticated learning algorithms versus simple rule-followers) and whether procedural interventions (transparency requirements, strategy constraints, oversight mechanisms) can prevent emergent pathologies (collusion, manipulation, discriminatory resource allocation). By integrating normative market design with multi-agent systems analysis, the research addresses the gap between mechanism theory focused on human participants and MAS research focused on technical coordination.

 

**Methodological innovation: Using simulation for pre-deployment moral learning about novel sociotechnical systems.** The project's most distinctive contribution is methodological: it demonstrates how computational simulation can enable moral learning about institutional design before real-world deployment. The Magentic platform serves multiple functions: as experimental apparatus enabling systematic variation of market rules and agent designs; as observational tool making emergent multi-agent dynamics visible; as testing ground for evaluating procedural interventions; and as site of normative inquiry generating philosophical insights through computational methods. The research develops validation criteria specifically for normative simulations of emerging sociotechnical systems (structural, counterfactual, and sensitivity validation), providing methodological foundations for simulation-based moral learning that extend beyond the agentic market context to emerging technologies generally. This bridges the gap between simulation epistemology (Winsberg 2010; Beisbart 2019) and normative philosophy (O'Connor 2019), establishing simulation not merely as illustration of pre-existing principles but as method for discovering normative insights about institutional design.

 

**Integration across domains and gaps.** These four dimensions are not independent but deeply interconnected. Procedural experimentalism provides the normative justification for using experiments to refine principles under uncertainty; AI ethics frameworks specify what values should guide agent design and market rules; mechanism design offers technical tools for institutional engineering; and simulation methodology enables experimental inquiry without real-world risks. Addressing Gap 1 (extending experimentalism to AI contexts) requires addressing Gap 2 (procedural justice for representatives) because procedural experimentalism demands fair processes, which in turn requires specifying what procedural fairness means for AI-mediated institutions. Addressing Gap 3 (moral pathologies in agent interactions) requires addressing Gap 4 (validation for normative simulations) because identifying pathologies depends on credible simulation evidence. And addressing Gap 5 (pre-deployment moral learning) depends on resolving Gaps 1-4 because simulation-based learning requires both normative frameworks (experimentalism, procedural justice) and epistemic standards (validation criteria).

 

**Novelty and significance.** This research represents the first systematic application of procedural experimentalism to agentic markets, the first normative simulation platform specifically designed for AI-mediated economic institutions, and the first integrated framework bridging political philosophy, AI ethics, market design, and simulation methodology for evaluating automated markets. The project's significance extends beyond agentic markets themselves: as AI systems increasingly mediate social institutions—governance, education, healthcare, information systems—we need frameworks for evaluating these hybrid human-AI arrangements. The methodological approach developed here—combining philosophical framework extension, computational experimentation, and purpose-specific validation—offers a model for responsible innovation in emerging sociotechnical systems generally. By demonstrating how pre-deployment moral learning can occur through simulation, the research provides foundations for normative inquiry about technological systems that are themselves still being designed, addressing a fundamental challenge for ethics in an age of rapid sociotechnical change.
