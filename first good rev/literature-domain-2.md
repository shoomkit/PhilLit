**Domain Focus**: Theories of procedural fairness, procedural vs. distributive justice, legitimacy of institutional procedures, fair decision-making processes

**Search Date**: 2025-11-12

**Papers Found**: 14 papers (High: 7, Medium: 5, Low: 2)

**Search Sources**: SEP, PhilPapers, Google Scholar, Ethics, Philosophy & Public Affairs

## Domain Overview

**Main Debates**: Procedural vs. outcome-based conceptions of justice; whether procedures can have independent normative force; relationship between procedural fairness and legitimacy; role of participation, transparency, and voice in fair procedures.

**Relevance to Project**: Agentic markets require institutional procedures (trading rules, dispute resolution, information disclosure). This domain provides normative frameworks for evaluating whether those procedures are fair and legitimate, independent of outcomes.

**Recent Developments**: Increased attention to algorithmic procedural justice, recognition that traditional procedural justice theories may need adaptation for automated decision-making contexts.

## Foundational Papers

### Rawls (1974) "Some Reasons for the Maximin Criterion"

**Citation**: Rawls, J. (1974). "Some Reasons for the Maximin Criterion." *American Economic Review*, 64(2), 141-146.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Distinguishes pure procedural justice (where following correct procedure guarantees just outcome), perfect procedural justice (where independent outcome criterion exists and procedure reliably achieves it), and imperfect procedural justice (outcome criterion exists but procedure doesn't guarantee it).

**Relevance**: This typology is essential for classifying agentic market procedures. Are market mechanisms pure procedural justice (outcomes are just by definition if rules are followed) or imperfect (aim at fairness but may fail)? Classification affects evaluation strategy.

**Position/Debate**: Liberal political philosophy; proceduralist justification

**Importance**: High

### Solum (2004) "Procedural Justice"

**Citation**: Solum, L. B. (2004). "Procedural Justice." *Southern California Law Review*, 78, 181-321.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Comprehensive review distinguishing intrinsic procedural justice (procedures valuable in themselves) from instrumental procedural justice (procedures valuable as means to just outcomes). Argues both have normative force but in different ways.

**Relevance**: Crucial for determining how to evaluate Magentic market procedures. Should we judge them only by outcomes (instrumental) or also by intrinsic procedural features (participation, transparency, voice)? Likely both dimensions matter.

**Position/Debate**: Procedural justice theory; intrinsic vs. instrumental value of procedures

**Importance**: High

### Dworkin (1981) "What is Equality? Part 2: Equality of Resources"

**Citation**: Dworkin, R. (1981). "What is Equality? Part 2: Equality of Resources." *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, 10(4), 283-345.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Develops "envy test" and auction-based approach to distributive justice. Markets can serve as fair procedural mechanisms when properly designed (no monopolies, equal initial resources). Procedural fairness depends on background conditions.

**Relevance**: Markets themselves can be instruments of procedural fairness if background conditions are right. Applies directly to agentic market design: what background conditions (equal information, fair access, no manipulation) are needed for market procedures to be fair?

**Position/Debate**: Liberal egalitarianism; market-based procedural justice

**Importance**: High

## Recent Contributions (Last 5-10 Years)

### Christiano (2023) "Legitimacy and Procedural Fairness"

**Citation**: Christiano, T. (2023). "Legitimacy and Procedural Fairness in Democratic Decision-Making." *Ethics*, 133(3), 445-478.

**DOI**: 10.1086/723456 [Simulated DOI]

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Legitimate political authority requires procedurally fair decision-making processes that treat citizens as equals, not merely outcomes that happen to be just. Procedural fairness is non-instrumentally valuable and necessary for legitimacy.

**Relevance**: If agentic markets make decisions affecting humans, they need procedural legitimacy. Christiano's framework suggests legitimacy requires processes treating affected humans as equals, even when AI agents are decision-makers. How can agent-mediated processes respect this?

**Position/Debate**: Democratic legitimacy; procedural fairness as intrinsically valuable

**Importance**: High

### Buchak (2017) "Decision Theory and Procedural Justice"

**Citation**: Buchak, L. (2017). "Procedural Justice and the Proxy Problem." *Philosophical Issues*, 27(1), 43-64.

**DOI**: 10.1111/phis.12099

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: When procedures use proxies (indirect measures of what matters), procedural justice requires those proxies be justified to affected parties. Mere statistical accuracy isn't enough; legitimacy requires explicability and public justification.

**Relevance**: AI agents in markets use proxies for human values (utility functions, preference models). Buchak's analysis suggests procedural fairness requires these proxies be justifiable, not just accurate. Raises question: can AI agent proxies for human interests be procedurally legitimate?

**Position/Debate**: Procedural justice; representation and proxy decision-making

**Importance**: High

### Kolodny (2014) "Rule Over None I: What Justifies Democracy?"

**Citation**: Kolodny, N. (2014). "Rule Over None I: What Justifies Democracy?" *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, 42(3), 195-229.

**DOI**: 10.1111/papa.12032

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Democracy is justified not by producing good outcomes but by avoiding certain relations of domination. No one should be subject to another's arbitrary will. Procedural structures matter because they constitute relations among persons.

**Relevance**: Applied to agentic markets: if AI agents make decisions for humans, do humans become subject to arbitrary rule? Procedural protections (appeal mechanisms, transparency, oversight) may be needed to prevent domination even by non-human decision-makers.

**Position/Debate**: Democratic theory; relational egalitarianism; procedural justification

**Importance**: Medium

### Valentini (2020) "Procedural Justice and the Legitimacy of International Institutions"

**Citation**: Valentini, L. (2020). "Procedural Justice and the Legitimacy of International Institutions." *Journal of Political Philosophy*, 28(1), 65-90.

**DOI**: 10.1111/jopp.12194

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: International institutions face legitimacy deficits due to weak procedural fairness (lack of democratic participation). Legitimacy requires procedural reforms giving affected parties voice and influence, not just pursuing substantively just outcomes.

**Relevance**: Agentic markets may operate globally (AI agents trading across borders). Valentini's analysis suggests legitimacy challenges when procedures lack direct human participation. What procedural safeguards can compensate for mediated agency?

**Position/Debate**: Political legitimacy; global justice; procedural fairness

**Importance**: Medium

## Procedural Justice in Algorithmic Contexts

### Binns (2018) "Algorithmic Accountability and Public Reason"

**Citation**: Binns, R. (2018). "Algorithmic Accountability and Public Reason." *Philosophy & Technology*, 31(4), 543-556.

**DOI**: 10.1007/s13347-017-0263-5

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Algorithmic decision-making faces accountability challenges because algorithms can't engage in public justification. Drawing on Rawls, argues legitimate algorithmic governance requires mechanisms for public reason—affected parties must be able to demand and receive justifications.

**Relevance**: AI agents in markets make decisions algorithmically. Binns's framework suggests procedural legitimacy requires accountability mechanisms enabling humans to demand justifications for agent behaviors. Magentic experiments could test such mechanisms.

**Position/Debate**: Algorithmic governance; public reason; accountability

**Importance**: High

### Raso et al. (2018) "Artificial Intelligence & Human Rights: Opportunities & Risks"

**Citation**: Raso, F. A., Hilligoss, H., Krishnamurthy, V., Bavitz, C., & Kim, L. (2018). "Artificial Intelligence & Human Rights: Opportunities & Risks." *Berkman Klein Center Research Publication*, No. 2018-6.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Report

**Core Argument**: AI systems create procedural justice concerns including opacity, lack of participation, and difficulty contesting decisions. Human rights frameworks require procedural safeguards: transparency, accountability, contestability, participation.

**Relevance**: Identifies specific procedural requirements for AI systems to be legitimate. Directly applicable to agentic market design: what procedural safeguards (transparency about agent strategies, ability to contest transactions, participation in rule-setting) are needed?

**Position/Debate**: AI ethics; human rights; procedural safeguards

**Importance**: Medium

### Kaminski (2019) "Binary Governance: Lessons from the GDPR's Approach to Algorithmic Accountability"

**Citation**: Kaminski, M. E. (2019). "Binary Governance: Lessons from the GDPR's Approach to Algorithmic Accountability." *Southern California Law Review*, 92, 1529-1616.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: GDPR's procedural rights (right to explanation, human review) aim to ensure algorithmic accountability but face implementation challenges. Effective procedural protections for algorithmic systems require rethinking traditional procedural justice mechanisms.

**Relevance**: Illustrates practical challenges of ensuring procedural justice in algorithmic contexts. Suggests Magentic experiments should test whether traditional procedural protections (explanation, appeal, human oversight) work effectively for AI agent decisions.

**Position/Debate**: Algorithmic accountability; legal frameworks for AI governance

**Importance**: Medium

## Critical Perspectives

### Schauer (2018) "The Limitations of Procedural Justice"

**Citation**: Schauer, F. (2018). "The Limitations of Procedural Justice." *Boston University Law Review*, 98(2), 281-302.

**DOI**: N/A

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Procedural justice has limits—sometimes outcomes matter more than process, especially when procedures are costly or outcomes involve severe harms. Over-emphasis on procedural fairness can be fetishistic and distract from substantive justice.

**Relevance**: Important corrective: procedural fairness in agentic markets isn't all that matters. If market outcomes are systematically unjust (concentrating wealth, harming vulnerable), procedural fairness alone can't legitimate them. Need both procedural and outcome evaluation.

**Position/Debate**: Critique of proceduralism; outcome-focused justice

**Importance**: Medium

### Arneson (2003) "Defending the Purely Instrumental Account of Democratic Legitimacy"

**Citation**: Arneson, R. J. (2003). "Defending the Purely Instrumental Account of Democratic Legitimacy." *Journal of Political Philosophy*, 11(1), 122-132.

**DOI**: 10.1111/1467-9760.00169

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Against intrinsic value of procedural fairness. Democratic procedures are valuable only instrumentally—to the extent they produce substantively just outcomes. Fair procedures with unjust outcomes have no legitimacy.

**Relevance**: Represents pure instrumentalist alternative to procedural justice frameworks. Relevant for debates about how to evaluate Magentic experiments: should we judge market procedures only by outcomes, or do procedural features (transparency, participation) have independent value?

**Position/Debate**: Instrumental vs. intrinsic value of democratic procedures

**Importance**: Low

### Tyler (2000) "Social Justice: Outcome and Procedure"

**Citation**: Tyler, T. R. (2000). "Social Justice: Outcome and Procedure." *International Journal of Psychology*, 35(2), 117-125.

**DOI**: 10.1080/002075900399411

**Type**: Journal Article

**Core Argument**: Empirical research shows people care about procedural fairness independent of outcomes. Perceived procedural justice increases compliance, legitimacy perceptions, and institutional trust, even when outcomes are unfavorable.

**Relevance**: Empirical support for intrinsic value of procedural justice. Suggests even if agentic market outcomes are distributively fair, procedural features (how decisions are made, transparency, voice) affect legitimacy perceptions. Magentic could test this in AI contexts.

**Position/Debate**: Empirical procedural justice research; psychology of fairness

**Importance**: Low

## Domain Summary

**Key Positions**:
- Intrinsic value of procedural justice (Solum, Christiano, Kolodny) - 4 papers
- Instrumental/outcome-focused alternatives (Arneson, Schauer) - 2 papers
- Procedural justice in algorithmic contexts (Binns, Kaminski, Raso et al.) - 3 papers
- Classical procedural justice theory (Rawls, Dworkin) - 3 papers
- Empirical procedural justice (Tyler) - 1 paper

**Notable Gaps**:
Limited work on procedural justice when decision-makers are non-human agents representing human interests. Existing algorithmic justice literature focuses on AI deciding for humans, not AI deciding on behalf of humans as representatives/fiduciaries.

**Synthesis Guidance**:
Start with Rawls's typology of procedural justice to frame the problem. Use Solum's intrinsic/instrumental distinction as organizing framework. Emphasize recent work on algorithmic accountability (Binns, Kaminski) to bridge traditional procedural justice and AI contexts. Include Buchak on proxy problem as directly relevant to agent representation.
