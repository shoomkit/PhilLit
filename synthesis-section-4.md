# Section 4: Research Gaps and Synthesis

This review examined what explains housing cost burdens in Germany through the lens of six hypotheses spanning measurement methodology (H6), burden distribution (H1, H2), and labor market determinants (H3, H4, H5). The evidence reveals a pattern: some questions receive strong empirical support, others remain plausible but unquantified, and critical gaps persist where existing studies stop short of direct hypothesis tests.

## Hypothesis Assessment Summary

**H6 (Measurement normatively charged)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Stone (2006) demonstrates that residual income approaches identify 62.1% of households as burdened versus 47.9% by traditional 30% ratio—a 14-percentage-point difference that determines policy priorities. Li and Xu (2022) show subjective and objective burden overlap imperfectly. Haffner and Hulse (2021) establish that measurement choices reflect normative priorities rather than value-neutral technical decisions. This finding is foundational: it means all subsequent findings must be interpreted in light of measurement approaches used.

**H2 (High burdens for low-income urban dwellers)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Every study confirms substantial income gradients. European Parliament (2024) reports 38.2% burden for low-income versus 16.2% for higher-income EU households. IMF (2023) finds almost half of poorest households overburdened regardless of tenure. Dustmann et al. (2022) document housing amplifying inequality three-fold (22pp→62pp). DIW (2021) shows two-thirds of elderly renters experience 30%+ burden. The evidence is quantitatively large, robust across measures, and consistent across studies.

**H1 (Flat median-income burdens despite rising costs)**: MIXED EVIDENCE. EmpiricaRegio (2024) finds median-income households pay 24% in metropolitan areas—below 30% threshold but rising. However, three adjustment mechanisms confound interpretation: migration (Stawarz et al. 2021 show rising costs reduce inflows, increase outflows), tenure structure (Kaas et al. 2021 show homeownership buffers some median incomes), and displacement (Berger & Aubry 2024 show 15% Berlin displacement). Cross-sectional data showing moderate median burdens may reflect continuous displacement of those experiencing rising burdens rather than true in-place stability. No longitudinal study tracks same households over time to test stability directly.

**H4 (80%+ wage explanation)**: PLAUSIBLE BUT NOT QUANTIFIED. Temporal evidence strongly supports wage role: IMF (2015) documents Hartz IV reduced real wages ~4%, Dustmann et al. (2014) show labor compensation falling 61%→55% of GDP (2001-2007), Bosch (2017) calculates Germany achieved -2% unit labor costs while OECD averaged +22%. Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coincides with burden increases, and Dustmann et al. (2022) establish housing's income share rose for bottom quintile. However, no decomposition study attributes proportions: what % of burden variation comes from wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition? The "80%+" figure lacks empirical test.

**H3 (Public sector wage repression)**: NOT SUPPORTED IN AGGREGATE. Bundesbank (2024) shows public sector wages rose 24% versus economy-wide 25% (2009-2018), essentially identical growth. Recent years show public sector outpacing private sector. Schmidt and Müller (2024) document strong collective bargaining maintained in public sector while eroding in private sector. Civil servants face rigid pay determination (Keller & Kirsch 2020), but no evidence of systematic aggregate repression affecting housing burden. Critical gap: no study directly compares housing burdens of public versus private sector workers at similar income levels.

**H5 (Dualization explains burden)**: STRONG THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, EMPIRICAL GAP. Palier and Thelen (2010) establish dualism "explicitly underwritten by state policy" in Germany. Emmenegger et al. (2012) provide comprehensive framework showing insider-outsider divides across industrial relations, labor market policy, and welfare state. Lennartz and Helbrecht (2020) explicitly link labor market dualization to housing outcomes. Marx (2012) identifies institutional complementarities reinforcing dualization. Framework is theoretically robust and conceptually compelling. However, critical empirical gap: no German study tests whether labor market insider/outsider status predicts housing burden after controlling for income level. Indirect evidence supports the link, but direct quantification is absent.

## Critical Research Gaps

**Decomposition analysis (H4)**: Need variance decomposition quantifying what proportion of housing burden variation wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition changes explain. Dustmann et al. (2022) show housing amplifies inequality but don't quantify relative contributions. Requires longitudinal data tracking households over time with detailed income and rent information.

**Labor market status and burden (H5)**: Need study testing whether labor market insider/outsider status (permanent vs. temporary contracts, collective bargaining coverage, employment protection) predicts housing burden controlling for income level. Would directly test dualization theory's housing implications. Requires combining SOEP employment data with housing cost data using appropriate statistical controls.

**Public-private sector comparison (H3)**: Need study comparing housing burdens of public sector workers versus private sector workers at same income levels, controlling for location, household composition, tenure status. Schmidt and Müller (2024) and Keller and Kirsch (2020) establish institutional differences, but burden outcomes remain untested.

**Median-income longitudinal stability (H1)**: Need longitudinal study tracking same median-income households within cities over time, not cross-sectional snapshots. Would distinguish true stability from spatial selection via migration and displacement. Requires residential mobility analysis with individual-level tracking.

## Synthesis: What Explains Housing Burden?

Strong evidence establishes that income level is the primary determinant of housing burden, with bottom quintiles facing burdens 20+ percentage points higher than top quintiles. This income gradient is robust across measurement approaches, data sources, and time periods (H2 strongly supported). Measurement operationalization fundamentally shapes who counts as burdened and policy priorities (H6 strongly supported).

Wage stagnation 2000-2015 likely contributed substantially to burden increases: timing coincides, magnitude matches (4% real wage decline from Hartz IV, 6pp GDP share shift), and distributional pattern aligns (wage losses concentrated at lower percentiles where burden rises most). However, precise quantification is lacking (H4 plausible but unquantified).

Dualization theory provides the most comprehensive framework for understanding structural determinants. It links industrial relations erosion, labor market deregulation, welfare state retrenchment, and housing marketization through institutional complementarities. The framework is theoretically sophisticated and enjoys strong conceptual support, but empirical quantification for Germany remains incomplete (H5 strong theory, empirical gap).

Public sector wage patterns do not support hypothesis of systematic repression driving housing burdens (H3 not supported), and median-income burden stability claims are confounded by spatial selection effects (H1 mixed evidence).

Housing policy's limited effectiveness—rent control effects vanish within a year (Kholodilin et al. 2016), social housing declined 4 million→1 million units (Habitat 2021), housing benefits reach limited populations (Jagemann 2022)—suggests structural labor market factors may be more determinative than housing supply interventions. This pattern indirectly supports labor market primacy (H4, H5), though direct tests remain absent.

The answer to "what explains housing burden?" emerges: burden is determined primarily by income level, with bottom quintiles severely affected. Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coinciding with burden increases suggests income-side factors substantially contribute. Dualization theory provides plausible structural framework linking labor market precarity to housing vulnerability. But precise causal decomposition—how much wage vs. rent vs. composition, whether labor market status independently predicts burden controlling for income—awaits empirical investigation. The literature documents correlations and establishes frameworks; it has not yet quantified causal mechanisms.
