# Section 1: Introduction and Measurement Debates

Housing cost burdens in Germany present both an empirical phenomenon demanding explanation and a methodological puzzle requiring careful specification. This literature review examines what explains the proportion of income households spend on housing, with particular focus on Germany's context as a high-rent, low-homeownership economy. Germany's housing system is distinctive: 54% of households rent (Brookings 2021), significantly higher than most developed economies, and 12.0% of the population lived in households overburdened by housing costs in 2024—spending more than 40% of disposable income on housing—compared to an EU average of 8.2% (Destatis 2024). This burden is not distributed evenly. As Dustmann, Fitzenberger, and Zimmermann (2022) document in their landmark study, housing expenditure dramatically amplifies income inequality trends: while the 50/10 income ratio increased by 22 percentage points between 1993 and 2013, it rose by 62 percentage points when housing costs are incorporated. This three-fold amplification effect suggests that understanding housing burden requires examining both demand-side factors (wages, income distribution) and supply-side factors (urban housing costs, rent dynamics).

Yet before analyzing substantive patterns, we must confront a fundamental methodological challenge: how housing burden is measured shapes who counts as burdened and what interventions appear justified. The literature reveals profound disagreement about appropriate operationalization. Stone (2006) contrasts the traditional ratio approach—which classifies households as burdened if they spend more than 30% or 40% of income on housing—with a residual income approach that calculates money remaining after both housing and other necessary expenditures (food, clothing, medical care, transportation). In his analysis of 30.9 million U.S. renter households, the residual income measure identified 62.1% as cost-burdened while the traditional 30% ratio captured only 47.9%—a 14-percentage-point difference (Stone 2006). This gap matters: different measures identify different populations as policy priorities.

The 30% threshold itself reflects historical contingency rather than empirical necessity. Herbert, Hermann, and McCue (2013) trace its origins to U.S. public housing policy in the 1960s-1970s, noting it became the de facto standard despite limited justification for why 30% rather than 25% or 35% represents the boundary of affordability. The threshold fails to account for household size, composition, or local cost variations, creating a one-size-fits-all metric applied across vastly different contexts. European practice typically employs a 40% overburden threshold using equivalised disposable income adjusted for household composition via the modified OECD scale (Eurostat 2024), introducing different normative assumptions about household needs.

Subjective and objective burden measures reveal further complexity. Li and Xu (2022), analyzing 14 European countries, find that objective cost burden (percentage of income spent on housing) and subjective burden (whether households feel housing costs are burdensome) are related but overlap imperfectly. Some households with high objective burdens do not report feeling burdened; others with lower objective burdens experience significant financial stress. This suggests housing burden is not merely a technical calculation but reflects household priorities, expectations, and context-specific circumstances that standardized ratios cannot fully capture.

Even data sources introduce measurement variation. Frick and Krell (2010) compare Germany's two major household panel surveys—the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)—finding that methodological differences in income measurement, survey design, and post-collection treatment produce different burden distributions. Choices about whether to use gross versus net income, how to account for housing quality, and whether to include utilities all affect burden calculations (Whitehead 2021).

Haffner and Hulse (2021) argue that these measurement choices are not merely technical but reflect normatively laden policy priorities. Ratio approaches prioritize simplicity and cross-context comparability; residual income approaches prioritize accuracy to actual household needs; subjective measures prioritize lived experience. No measurement is value-neutral—each embodies assumptions about what constitutes "affordability" and who deserves policy attention.

The following sections report findings as stated in original studies while noting measurement approaches when relevant to interpretation. Most German and European studies employ ratio approaches with 30% or 40% thresholds, enabling cross-study comparison but potentially missing households captured by alternative measures. This measurement heterogeneity is itself a key finding: housing burden operationalization fundamentally shapes empirical conclusions and policy recommendations, confirming that measurement choice is normatively charged (Hypothesis 6).
