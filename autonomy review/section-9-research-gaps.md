# Section 9: Research Gaps and Implications for Conceptual Revision

The preceding review establishes substantial knowledge about autonomy in philosophy and social sciences and about AI's workplace impacts empirically. Yet it also reveals systematic gaps—limitations in existing frameworks that empirically-informed conceptual revision could address. This section identifies four major gap categories and argues that these gaps collectively make the case for reconceptualizing workplace autonomy in light of algorithmic management's realities.

## Gap 1: Philosophical Theories Developed Without AI in Mind

The most fundamental gap is historical: dominant autonomy theories were developed before algorithmic management existed. Kant's (1785) rational self-legislation, Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical mesh, Dworkin's (1988) procedural independence, and even contemporary relational approaches (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000) were formulated for different contexts. They address questions about whether determinism threatens free will, how socialization affects preference formation, and when paternalistic interference is justified—not how algorithmic opacity, information asymmetry, and behavioral nudges affect autonomous agency.

This temporal gap creates conceptual gaps. Philosophical theories lack resources for addressing:

**Algorithmic opacity**: Traditional theories assume agents can understand forces affecting them, even if that understanding is partial. But algorithmic opacity can make understanding impossible—not through deliberate concealment alone but through genuine technical complexity, proprietary secrecy, and system dynamics even designers don't fully grasp. What does "reasons-responsiveness" (Wolf 1990) mean when the system governing one's work is opaque to reason?

**Continuous surveillance and data extraction**: Philosophers have analyzed observation and monitoring, but not continuous automated data collection at scale where behavioral surplus is extracted for prediction markets (Zuboff 2019). Traditional autonomy theories don't address whether constant surveillance undermines the privacy conditions autonomy requires, or whether being treated as data source rather than agent violates dignity.

**Personalized algorithmic treatment**: Dubal's (2023) algorithmic wage discrimination—different workers receiving different pay for identical work based on algorithmic profiles—creates conditions earlier theories didn't anticipate. Can workers be autonomous when they receive personalized information, pricing, and opportunities designed to maximize their compliance? Traditional manipulation concepts assume interpersonal relationships, not algorithmic behavioral design at scale.

**Indirect control through information and incentives**: Kellogg et al.'s (2020) framework reveals control operates through recommending, recording, rating, and rewarding—not just restricting and replacing. These indirect mechanisms formally preserve choice while shaping it through information provision and incentive structures. Do they violate autonomy? Traditional theories focusing on coercion and manipulation may not clearly classify these cases.

Recent philosophical work begins addressing AI and autonomy (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b; Bankins and Formosa 2023), but workplace autonomy specifically receives limited attention. Most AI ethics work focuses on bias, privacy, or existential risk rather than labor conditions and worker autonomy. This gap means philosophical resources for evaluating and critiquing algorithmic management remain underdeveloped.

## Gap 2: Empirical Autonomy Research Lacks Conceptual Depth

While philosophical theories lack empirical grounding in AI contexts, empirical workplace autonomy research lacks philosophical depth. Organizational psychology measures autonomy through work scheduling autonomy, decision-making autonomy, and work methods autonomy (Morgeson and Humphrey 2006). These operational measures are useful but conceptually thin.

**Missing dimensions**: Standard measures may not capture autonomy dimensions specific to algorithmic work: data autonomy (control over how one's data is used), algorithmic transparency (ability to understand systems governing work), contestation rights (ability to challenge automated decisions), protection from manipulation (safeguards against behavioral nudges). Existing measures were developed for human-managed work and may miss what's distinctive about algorithmic management.

**Conceptual clarity about autonomy types**: Empirical research distinguishes autonomy dimensions (scheduling, methods, decisions) without philosophical clarity about how these relate to autonomy as such. Are these equally important aspects of a unitary autonomy construct, or distinct forms of autonomy with different normative significance? Why does autonomy over work methods matter morally—is it instrumental for other goods or intrinsically valuable?

**Adaptive preferences problem**: Self-report autonomy measures ask workers whether they experience autonomy. But what if workers adapt preferences to constrained conditions, reporting autonomy under objectively restricting circumstances? Philosophical work on adaptive preferences (Elster, Nussbaum) could inform empirical measurement, but integration remains limited. Without conceptual resources for distinguishing genuine from adaptive autonomy experiences, empirical measures may miss autonomy violations.

**Autonomy's moral significance**: Empirical research documents that autonomy predicts satisfaction, engagement, and performance (Humphrey et al. 2007; Van den Broeck et al. 2016). But why does autonomy matter morally? Is it valuable only instrumentally for these outcomes, or does it have intrinsic value grounded in human dignity? Empirical research rarely addresses these normative questions, leaving it unclear how to trade off autonomy against other goods.

This gap means empirical workplace autonomy research, while robust, may miss conceptually important aspects while measuring what's tractable rather than what's most significant.

## Gap 3: Limited Integration Across Philosophical and Empirical Domains

Beyond each domain's internal gaps, systematic integration gaps exist between philosophical and empirical research.

**Conceptual-operational mismatch**: Philosophical concepts (identification, authenticity, self-governance) don't map straightforwardly onto empirical measures (scheduling autonomy, decision authority). The relationship between philosophical autonomy and empirically measured workplace autonomy remains unclear. Are they measuring the same thing at different levels of abstraction? Different aspects of a broader phenomenon? Or partially overlapping but distinct concepts?

Herzog's (2018) work on transformational agency—critical, creative engagement with organizational roles—exemplifies integration potential. She combines philosophical analysis with 32 worker interviews, developing concepts grounded in both normative theory and lived experience. But such integration is rare. Most philosophical work proceeds without empirical investigation; most empirical work proceeds without philosophical depth.

**Measurement innovation opportunities**: Philosophical theories could inform measurement innovation. If relational autonomy theories are right that autonomy requires social recognition and dialogical possibility (Westlund 2009), can these be operationalized and measured? If procedural autonomy theories emphasize authentic preference formation processes (Dworkin 1988), can we distinguish authentic from adaptive preferences empirically?

Conversely, empirical findings could inform philosophical theorizing. If workers report experiencing autonomy paradoxically—high in some dimensions, low in others (Wood et al. 2019)—should philosophical theories accommodate autonomy's multidimensionality rather than treating it as unitary?

**Cross-domain validation**: How could we know if a philosophical autonomy theory is empirically adequate? One approach: operationalize the theory's conditions, measure them in actual workplaces, test whether they predict outcomes the theory says autonomy enables (flourishing, moral responsibility, dignity). Few studies attempt such validation. This gap means philosophical theories remain largely untested empirically while empirical research lacks philosophical grounding.

## Gap 4: Worker Voice Missing from Conceptual Work

Perhaps most critically, worker voices are largely absent from conceptual work on autonomy. Philosophers theorize what autonomy requires without systematically investigating what workers experiencing algorithmic management identify as autonomy-relevant. Empirical researchers measure autonomy using predetermined scales without grounded theory exploration of how workers conceptualize autonomy, control, and agency.

**What workers know**: Workers under algorithmic management develop sophisticated practical knowledge about how systems operate, what autonomy means in their contexts, and how constraints affect agency. Sutherland and Jarrahi (2019) document "algorithmic competencies"—understanding developed through experience. Workers know where autonomy is threatened, how opacity affects decision-making, and what conditions enable versus undermine agency. This knowledge is epistemically valuable for conceptual work but remains largely untapped.

**Grounded concept development**: Grounded theory methodology (Charmaz 2014) provides frameworks for developing concepts systematically from participant perspectives. Applied to workplace autonomy: rather than importing philosophical theories and testing whether workers satisfy their conditions, we could investigate what workers identify as autonomy-relevant features of their work, what categories emerge from their accounts, and how these relate to existing theories.

Cant's (2019) workers' inquiry with Deliveroo riders and Irani and Silberman's (2013) Turkopticon research demonstrate value of centering worker perspectives. Workers identify algorithmic management features (arbitrary deactivation, opaque evaluation, pay manipulation) that undermine autonomy in ways philosophical theories might not anticipate. They also identify autonomy-supporting conditions (solidarity, information sharing, collective organizing) that individualistic theories might miss.

**Diverse worker experiences**: Workers are not homogeneous—experiences vary by platform, sector, occupation, race, gender, class, immigration status. Ticona and Mateescu's (2018) research on care platforms shows how algorithmic management affects marginalized workers differently. Conceptual work failing to engage diverse worker perspectives risks developing theories that don't capture how autonomy operates across social positions.

## Implications for Conceptual Revision

These gaps—philosophical theories developed without AI in mind, empirical research lacking conceptual depth, limited integration across domains, and missing worker voices—collectively make the case for empirically-informed conceptual revision.

**What revision could accomplish**:

1. **Update concepts for algorithmic contexts**: Develop autonomy concepts adequate to conditions philosophical theories didn't anticipate—opacity, continuous surveillance, personalized algorithmic treatment, indirect control through information and incentives.

2. **Integrate philosophical and empirical insights**: Combine philosophical sophistication about what autonomy requires with empirical evidence about how autonomy operates and what predicts flourishing in actual workplace contexts.

3. **Ground concepts in worker experiences**: Center worker voices in conceptual development, using grounded theory to identify what workers experiencing algorithmic management find autonomy-relevant.

4. **Enable better evaluation**: Develop concepts enabling clearer evaluation of algorithmic management systems—which features violate autonomy, which support it, how to design systems respecting worker agency.

5. **Inform practice and policy**: Create conceptual resources useful for workers, advocates, designers, and regulators—not just academic theory but practically relevant frameworks for understanding and improving workplace conditions.

**How interview-based research addresses gaps**: Systematic interviews with workers across different algorithmic management contexts could:

- **Identify novel autonomy dimensions**: What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant beyond traditional measures? Data control? Algorithmic transparency? Contestation rights? Solidarity opportunities?

- **Test philosophical theories empirically**: Do workers' experiences align with philosophical autonomy theories? Which theories best capture what workers identify as autonomy-undermining versus autonomy-supporting?

- **Develop grounded concepts**: What conceptual categories emerge from worker accounts? How do workers make sense of autonomy, control, and agency under algorithmic management?

- **Address diverse experiences**: How does algorithmic management affect autonomy differently for workers in different positions? What intersectional patterns emerge?

- **Inform ameliorative analysis**: What autonomy concept would best serve our purposes given what we learn about worker experiences and what predicts their flourishing?

This approach combines philosophical methods (conceptual analysis, normative argument) with empirical investigation (systematic interviews, grounded theory analysis) and normative purposes (developing concepts serving emancipatory aims). It takes seriously both philosophical sophistication and empirical grounding while centering worker perspectives often marginalized in academic research.

## From Gaps to Research Program

The gaps identified here are not deficiencies to criticize but opportunities for productive research. They reveal that we need conceptual work that is:

- **Empirically informed**: Grounded in how algorithmic management actually operates and affects workers
- **Philosophically sophisticated**: Maintaining conceptual clarity and normative depth
- **Worker-centered**: Taking seriously what workers experiencing these systems identify as important
- **Integrative**: Combining insights from philosophy, social science, and worker experience
- **Practically oriented**: Developing concepts useful for evaluation, critique, design, and policy

Such research would not abandon existing philosophical or empirical frameworks but build on their insights while addressing their limitations. The goal is not replacing existing concepts wholesale but refining and extending them to adequately address contemporary workplace realities.
