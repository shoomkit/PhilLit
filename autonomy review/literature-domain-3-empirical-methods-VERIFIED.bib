====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
This domain covers empirical methods for conceptual work in philosophy, spanning experimental philosophy (x-phi), grounded theory methodology, qualitative research methods, and conceptual analysis/engineering. Experimental philosophy emerged in the early 2000s as a movement using empirical methods (surveys, experiments) to test philosophical intuitions and theories, particularly in epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind (Knobe & Nichols 2008, Weinberg et al. 2001). Grounded theory, originating with Glaser & Strauss (1967), provides systematic methods for developing theory from qualitative data, with constructivist variants (Charmaz 2006, 2014) emphasizing researcher positionality. Conceptual analysis methodology debates center on whether philosophy requires intuitions (Williamson 2007, Cappelen 2012) and how concepts can be ameliorated (Haslanger 2012, Burgess et al. 2020). Recent developments integrate empirical and normative analysis, with conceptual engineering offering frameworks for improving concepts to serve normative goals.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These methodologies are directly relevant to research combining philosophical analysis with empirical investigation. Experimental philosophy provides established methods for testing folk intuitions about philosophical concepts (relevant if studying public/stakeholder understanding). Grounded theory offers rigorous frameworks for developing conceptual frameworks from qualitative data (interviews, observations). Ameliorative analysis (Haslanger) provides methods for normatively-driven concept refinement. Mixed methods approaches (Creswell, Tashakkori & Teddlie) bridge quantitative and qualitative paradigms. This domain provides methodological foundations for philosophical research that moves beyond armchair theorizing to engage empirical reality.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
Past decade has seen: (1) Maturation of x-phi with specialized handbooks (Sytsma & Buckwalter 2016) and ongoing Oxford Studies series (Lombrozo et al. 2022); (2) Conceptual engineering emerging as distinct field (Burgess et al. 2020) with debates about method and goals; (3) Increased attention to philosophical expertise and whether philosophers' intuitions differ from folk (Nado 2014); (4) Integration of cognitive science insights into philosophical methodology (Strevens 2019, Lombrozo 2012); (5) Fourth editions of major qualitative methods textbooks reflecting methodological sophistication (Charmaz 2014, Creswell & Poth 2018, Saldaña 2021).

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited work on: (1) Integration of grounded theory specifically for philosophical concept development (mostly used in social sciences); (2) Empirical testing of ameliorated concepts post-engineering; (3) Mixed methods designs combining x-phi surveys with qualitative depth interviews; (4) Comparative studies of different conceptual analysis methods; (5) Replication studies in x-phi (though meta-analyses emerging, e.g., ESEE); (6) Application of qualitative coding methods (Saldaña) to philosophical texts/arguments; (7) Systematic evaluation criteria for successful conceptual engineering projects.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For SOTA review: Distinguish three methodological clusters: (1) X-phi experimental methods for testing intuitions (emphasize Knobe & Nichols 2008, Weinberg et al. 2001, debates about expertise); (2) Qualitative methods for theory/concept development (Charmaz 2006/2014, Mills et al. 2006, with attention to philosophical vs. social science applications); (3) Conceptual analysis/engineering (Haslanger ameliorative analysis, Burgess et al. 2020, debates with Jackson 1998, Cappelen 2012, Williamson 2007). Note tensions: x-phi skepticism about intuitions vs. defenders of armchair methods; classic vs. constructivist grounded theory; descriptive vs. ameliorative conceptual analysis. For application: Consider which methods fit research goals—testing folk understanding (x-phi), developing grounded concepts (GT), or normative concept improvement (ameliorative).

Argues conceptual analysis is not mysterious a priori activity but something familiar to everyone. Uses metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of mind examples to show how conceptual analysis works. Argues we need conceptual analysis to connect scientific/metaphysical facts to everyday concepts and ethical conclusions. RELEVANCE: Major defense of traditional conceptual analysis methodology. Contrasts with both x-phi skepticism and ameliorative approaches. Argues for descriptive conceptual analysis focused on capturing folk concepts. Important for understanding methodological debates about conceptual analysis. Represents traditional armchair approach x-phi challenges but Jackson defends.

Argues this claim is false—philosophers don't actually rely much on intuitions, at worst just engage in irresponsible 'intuition'-vocabulary. Examines philosophical practice and finds little genuine intuition-reliance. Argues meta-philosophical debates rest on mischaracterization of philosophical methodology.

Argues philosophical concepts are like natural kind concepts—capable of launching inquiry despite not containing answers. Philosophical analysis is inductive analysis explaining how novel knowledge can be generated in armchair. Edge cases play crucial role in discoveries.
