# Literature Review Plan: AI's Impact on Workplace Autonomy

**Research Topic**: Examining how AI impacts workplace autonomy and whether existing philosophical/social-scientific accounts of autonomy need revision

**Research Approach**: Empirically-informed conceptual analysis using qualitative interviews with employees

**Date**: November 17, 2025

---

## Research Objectives

This literature review supports a research project that:
1. Uses qualitative interviews with employees about workplace autonomy and AI's impact
2. Employs these empirical findings as input for theorizing/revising the concept of autonomy
3. Integrates philosophical and social-scientific perspectives
4. Identifies gaps in current autonomy theories for understanding AI-mediated work contexts
