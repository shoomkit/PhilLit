RESEARCH IDEA:
Examining how AI impacts workplace autonomy and whether existing philosophical/social-scientific accounts of autonomy need revision. The project uses qualitative interviews with employees about workplace autonomy and AI's impact as empirical input for theorizing/revising the concept of autonomy through empirically-informed conceptual analysis.

REQUIRED DOMAINS:
1. Philosophical Perspectives on Autonomy (general theory + workplace-specific)
2. Social Science Perspectives on Autonomy and Workplace Autonomy (general + workplace-specific)
3. Empirical Methods for Concept Theorization
4. AI's Impact on Workplace Autonomy

KEY RESEARCH QUESTIONS:
1. What are the dominant theoretical frameworks for understanding autonomy in philosophy?
2. What are the dominant frameworks for understanding autonomy in social sciences?
3. How do general autonomy theories apply (or fail to apply) to workplace contexts?
4. What gaps exist in current autonomy theories for understanding AI-mediated work?
5. How have researchers used empirical methods (especially qualitative) to develop/revise philosophical concepts?
6. What does existing research say about AI's impact on workplace autonomy?
7. What are the key debates and unresolved questions?

USER REQUIREMENTS:
- Comprehensive and thorough - NO WORD LIMIT
- Use AS MANY high-quality sources as useful
- Wide net: recent work (5-10 years) + foundational texts
- Interdisciplinary: philosophy + social sciences
- Both general and work-specific perspectives
