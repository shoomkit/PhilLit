# Section 1: Introduction

## Research Motivation: AI Transforming Workplace Autonomy

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally reshaping how work is organized, managed, and experienced. From algorithmic scheduling systems in warehouses to AI-driven performance monitoring in knowledge work, intelligent systems increasingly mediate the relationship between workers and their work. Recent institutional data reveals the scale of this transformation: 74% of firms in the United States now use software to automate managerial tasks, while 42.3% of European workers report working under algorithmic management systems (OECD 2025). Yet this technological shift raises profound philosophical questions that existing frameworks struggle to address: What happens to worker autonomy when algorithms assign tasks, monitor performance, and evaluate competence? How should we understand agency and control in work contexts increasingly shaped by opaque, data-driven systems?

These questions matter because autonomy—the capacity for self-governance and self-determination—has long been recognized as essential to human flourishing, moral responsibility, and dignity. Philosophical traditions from Kant (1785) to contemporary relational autonomy theorists (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000; Lee 2023) emphasize that autonomy requires not just freedom from constraint but also supportive social conditions, access to information, and meaningful options. In workplace contexts specifically, empirical research across organizational psychology and sociology demonstrates that job autonomy predicts critical outcomes including job satisfaction, engagement, mental health, and performance (Humphrey et al. 2007; Van den Broeck et al. 2016). The Self-Determination Theory framework positions autonomy as a basic psychological need, on par with competence and relatedness (Ryan and Deci 2000). Workplace democracy advocates argue that if autonomy grounds political legitimacy, it should also ground economic governance (Dahl 1985; Anderson 2017).

Yet algorithmic management creates conditions that challenge core assumptions of these theories. Platform workers describe experiences of "algorithmic despotism" where systems minutely regulate time and activities while providing minimal information about how decisions are made (Griesbach et al. 2019). Information asymmetries between platforms and workers create what Lee et al. (2015) identify as fundamental barriers to autonomous decision-making—workers cannot make informed choices without understanding the systems governing their work. Opacity compounds control: when workers don't know how algorithms evaluate performance or allocate rewards, they lack the transparency many autonomy theories presume (Pasquale 2015; Ajunwa 2020). The scale and sophistication of data collection enable "surveillance capitalism" that treats workers as sources of behavioral data for extraction rather than agents deserving respect (Zuboff 2019).

## Why Existing Autonomy Concepts May Be Insufficient

This review argues that existing philosophical and empirical concepts of autonomy are insufficient for understanding and evaluating AI's workplace impacts. The insufficiency operates at multiple levels:

**Conceptual lag**: Dominant autonomy theories were developed without AI-mediated work in mind. Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical model asks whether agents identify with their first-order desires through second-order volitions. Dworkin's (1988) procedural account focuses on whether identification processes are authentic rather than manipulated. But what does identification mean when algorithms shape which opportunities workers encounter, what information they receive, and how their performance is interpreted? These theories lack conceptual resources for addressing algorithmic opacity, data-driven personalization, and automated decision-making at scale.

**Measurement gaps**: Organizational psychology operationalizes autonomy through constructs like "work scheduling autonomy," "decision-making autonomy," and "work methods autonomy" (Morgeson and Humphrey 2006). These measures capture important dimensions but miss aspects specific to algorithmic management: autonomy over one's data, algorithmic transparency, and ability to contest automated decisions. The Job Characteristics Model (Hackman and Oldham 1976) treats autonomy as a stable job feature, but algorithmic systems can create dynamic, personalized experiences where autonomy varies within the same nominal job (Dubal 2023).

**Individual vs. relational tensions**: While relational autonomy theorists emphasize social constitution of agency (Westlund 2009; Friedman 2003), empirical workplace autonomy research remains largely individualistic. Yet algorithmic management reveals autonomy's fundamentally relational character: platform architectures distribute power asymmetrically, customer ratings mediate worker evaluation, and information asymmetries structure what workers can know and do (Curchod et al. 2020). Neither purely individualistic nor purely relational frameworks adequately capture these dynamics.

**Philosophical-empirical disconnect**: Philosophical autonomy debates rarely engage empirical findings about how workers actually experience and navigate algorithmic systems. Conversely, empirical research on algorithmic management often lacks philosophical sophistication about what autonomy requires and why it matters. This disconnect means philosophical theories risk irrelevance to actual workplace conditions, while empirical work lacks normative grounding for evaluation and critique.

## Structure of This Review

This review synthesizes philosophical, social scientific, and empirical literatures to map the state of knowledge about autonomy and AI-mediated work, identify critical gaps, and make the case for conceptual revision grounded in empirical investigation.

**Sections 2-3** establish philosophical foundations. Section 2 surveys general autonomy theories from classical accounts (Kant, Mill) through hierarchical models (Frankfurt, Dworkin) to contemporary relational approaches (Mackenzie and Stoljar, Westlund). Section 3 examines how philosophers have applied autonomy concepts specifically to work, including meaningful work theories (Veltman 2016; Cholbi 2022) and workplace democracy arguments (Anderson 2017; Frega et al. 2019). These sections establish conceptual baselines against which to evaluate AI's impacts.

**Section 4** presents social science perspectives on workplace autonomy, reviewing Self-Determination Theory (Gagné and Deci 2005), job design models (Hackman and Oldham 1980; Karasek 1979; Bakker and Demerouti 2007), job crafting and proactivity research (Wrzesniewski and Dutton 2001; Parker and Bindl 2017), and critical labor sociology (Braverman 1974; Kalleberg 2011). This section demonstrates robust empirical evidence for autonomy's importance while revealing measurement and conceptual limitations.

**Section 5** examines empirical methods for conceptual work, including experimental philosophy (Knobe and Nichols 2008), grounded theory for concept development (Charmaz 2014), and conceptual engineering approaches (Haslanger 2012; Burgess et al. 2020). These methodologies provide frameworks for empirically-informed concept revision.

**Sections 6-7** turn to AI's workplace impacts. Section 6 synthesizes empirical findings on algorithmic management frameworks (Kellogg et al. 2020), platform work conditions (Wood et al. 2019; Gray and Suri 2019), institutional data (OECD 2025; ILO 2024), and worker experiences. Section 7 examines critical political economy perspectives (Srnicek 2017; Zuboff 2019; Gandini 2019) and worker resistance strategies (Cini 2023; Cant 2019).

**Section 8** synthesizes key debates and theoretical tensions, including procedural vs. substantive autonomy in AI contexts, individual vs. relational autonomy under algorithmic management, and philosophical vs. empirical approaches to autonomy research.

**Section 9** identifies research gaps and argues for conceptual revision, showing how limitations in existing theories create need for empirically-grounded reconceptualization of workplace autonomy.

**Section 10** concludes by synthesizing findings and outlining paths forward for integrating philosophical rigor with empirical investigation.

## Research Questions Addressed

Throughout, this review addresses several interconnected questions:

1. **What do philosophical theories identify as necessary conditions for autonomy, and how might algorithmic management undermine these conditions?** Examining whether AI systems threaten autonomy requires clarity about what autonomy requires—a question philosophical theories directly address.

2. **How do social scientists operationalize and measure workplace autonomy, and what are the strengths and limitations of these approaches?** Understanding empirical methods and findings reveals what we know empirically about autonomy while identifying conceptual and measurement gaps.

3. **What empirical evidence exists about AI's impacts on worker autonomy, control, and agency?** Recent research on algorithmic management, platform work, and automation provides substantial evidence about how AI systems reshape work, though philosophical engagement with these findings remains limited.

4. **What tensions exist between philosophical and empirical approaches to autonomy, and how might they be productively integrated?** Philosophical sophistication without empirical grounding risks irrelevance; empirical research without normative frameworks lacks evaluative criteria. Integration requires methodological innovation.

5. **Why do existing autonomy concepts need revision to adequately address AI-mediated work?** Making the case for conceptual revision requires demonstrating that existing frameworks have systematic limitations that empirically-informed reconceptualization could address.

By integrating across disciplines and methods, this review establishes the intellectual foundation for empirical research aimed at revising autonomy concepts in light of AI's workplace transformations. The stakes are high: if autonomy is essential for human dignity, moral responsibility, and flourishing, understanding how algorithmic systems affect it becomes urgent. Yet without adequate concepts, we cannot clearly identify threats, evaluate interventions, or imagine alternatives. Conceptual work, empirically grounded, is thus not merely academic but practically and politically essential.

# Section 2: Philosophical Foundations of Autonomy

Understanding how AI affects workplace autonomy requires clarity about what autonomy is and why it matters. Philosophical traditions offer sophisticated accounts, though they disagree about fundamental questions: Is autonomy primarily about rational self-legislation (Kant), identification with one's desires (Frankfurt), responsiveness to reasons (Wolf), or participation in relationships of mutual recognition (Westlund)? These are not merely theoretical disputes—different conceptions have different implications for evaluating algorithmic management systems and workplace conditions.

## Classical Accounts: Kant and Mill

Two classical traditions establish autonomy's centrality to moral and political philosophy. Kant's (1785) account grounds autonomy in rational self-legislation: autonomous agents give themselves moral law through reason rather than being heteronomously governed by inclination or external authority. In the *Groundwork*, Kant argues that autonomy is "the ground of the dignity of human nature" (Kant 1785)—what makes persons ends in themselves rather than mere means. This conception emphasizes the capacity for rational reflection and action according to principles one legislates for oneself. Contemporary Kantian accounts (Korsgaard 2009) develop autonomy as self-constitution: through action, agents constitute their own agency and identity.

Kantian autonomy sets high standards. It requires not just absence of coercion but positive capacity for rational self-governance. Applied to work contexts, Cholbi (2020) argues that meaningful work must be "freely entered, affording workers opportunities to exercise independent judgment, allowing pursuit of own ends distinct from employer-mandated ends." This connects autonomy to workplace conditions: work that reduces workers to instruments executing others' decisions fails to respect their autonomy and dignity.

Mill's (1859) liberal tradition offers a different emphasis. *On Liberty* defends individual autonomy as essential for human flourishing and social progress, not just moral requirement. Mill argues for individuality, self-development, and "experiments in living" as crucial for both personal and collective advancement. Autonomy requires protection from both state coercion and "tyranny of the majority"—social pressure toward conformity that can be as constraining as legal sanctions. Mill's emphasis on variety, development, and resistance to conformity suggests that autonomy thrives when individuals can choose and pursue diverse life paths.

These classical accounts establish autonomy's importance but face challenges in workplace applications. Kantian autonomy's demanding rational requirements may exclude forms of agency that don't meet high cognitive standards (Benson 1994). Mill's individualism may overlook how social relationships and power structures shape the options available for choice. Both traditions were developed without contemporary technologies in mind, creating conceptual gaps when addressing algorithmic systems.

## Hierarchical Models: Frankfurt and Dworkin

Contemporary autonomy debates were transformed by Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical model. Frankfurt introduces first-order desires (desires to do or not do something) versus second-order desires (desires about which desires to have). Crucially, he distinguishes second-order desires from second-order *volitions*—wanting a particular first-order desire to be effective in action. Free will, Frankfurt argues, requires this "mesh": having the will one wants to have, caring about one's motivational structure at a higher level.

Frankfurt's account makes autonomy compatible with determinism—what matters is internal hierarchical harmony, not independence from causal chains. The addict who wishes to be free of addiction but cannot escape its pull lacks free will not because determined but because of hierarchical conflict between first-order desire (for drug) and second-order volition (wanting not to be moved by that desire).

Dworkin (1988) develops Frankfurt's insights into a procedural autonomy theory. In *The Theory and Practice of Autonomy*, Dworkin argues that autonomy requires "procedural independence"—second-order identification with first-order desires formed through one's own reflection rather than manipulation. The account is procedural (not substantive) because it doesn't require having correct values, just authentic identification with whatever values one has. Procedural autonomy focuses on the *how* of preference formation, not the *what*.

Applied to workplaces, hierarchical accounts raise important questions: Do workers identify with their work motivations, or do they feel alienated from what they do? When organizational cultures shape employee values and goals, does this constitute manipulation that undermines autonomy? If algorithmic management systems use behavioral nudges and gamification to influence what workers want, does this violate procedural independence even if workers subsequently identify with induced preferences?

The challenge is distinguishing legitimate influence from autonomy-undermining manipulation. All socialization shapes desires—the question is which processes preserve versus violate autonomy. Hierarchical accounts struggle to specify this distinction clearly. As Mele (1995) argues, self-control (ability to resist conflicting desires) may be insufficient for autonomy if preferences were formed through problematic processes.

## Procedural versus Substantive Autonomy

Debates between procedural and substantive autonomy accounts structure contemporary discussions. Procedural accounts (Christman 2009; Dworkin 1988) hold that autonomy depends on *how* preferences form—through reflection, identification, and absence of manipulation—not on preference content. One can autonomously choose poorly. Substantive accounts (Raz 1986; Wolf 1990) argue that autonomy requires not just procedural conditions but adequate valuable options and some normative competence.

Raz's (1986) perfectionist liberalism in *The Morality of Freedom* argues that autonomy requires an adequate range of valuable options. Mere freedom from interference is insufficient if one lacks genuinely good life possibilities. This "options" account suggests workplaces must provide meaningful work opportunities, not just absence of coercion, for workers to be autonomous. Raz's perfectionism is controversial—who determines which options are valuable?—but it highlights that formal freedom may be hollow without substantive opportunities.

Wolf's (1990) "Reason View" in *Freedom Within Reason* charts middle ground. She argues that freedom requires not independence from all external influence but ability to appreciate and respond to reasons. Some external influences (good education, accurate information) enhance rather than threaten autonomy by developing capacities for reasonable judgment. This suggests workplace conditions that develop worker capabilities and provide good information support autonomy, while those that distort information or prevent development undermine it.

For workplace autonomy, the procedural-substantive divide matters practically. Purely procedural accounts might accept any preferences workers authentically endorse, including those formed under oppressive conditions. Substantive accounts can critique objectively poor work conditions but risk paternalism about what constitutes valuable work. The challenge is acknowledging social influence on preferences while maintaining critical capacity to distinguish supportive from undermining influences.

## Relational Autonomy: Social Constitution of Agency

Feminist philosophers have fundamentally challenged individualistic autonomy conceptions. The influential anthology *Relational Autonomy* (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000) collects essays arguing that autonomy is constituted through social relationships rather than opposed to them. As Stoljar (2024) explains in her Stanford Encyclopedia entry on feminist autonomy perspectives, relational approaches show how oppression can impair autonomy through preference adaptation and internalized norms, not just external constraint.

Relational autonomy theorists (Friedman 2003; Meyers 1989; Westlund 2009) argue that traditional accounts wrongly presume atomistic, self-sufficient agents. Real human autonomy develops through relationships and depends on social conditions. Meyers (1989) conceptualizes autonomy as a repertoire of competencies developed socially over time—not an innate property but cultivated capacities. Benson (1994) argues that autonomous agency requires a sense of one's own worth that depends on social recognition and standing. When hierarchical relationships deny recognition or status, they undermine not just opportunities for autonomous action but the very capacity for it.

Westlund's (2009) dialogical account makes answerability to others constitutive of autonomy rather than threatening to it. Autonomous agents must be "answerable" to others—capable of dialogue and responsiveness to others' perspectives. This challenges views that autonomy means independence from others' input. Being held accountable within relationships can support rather than undermine self-governance.

For workplace autonomy, relational approaches provide crucial insights. Organizational cultures, power relations, and social recognition aren't just external factors affecting pre-formed autonomous agents—they constitute the conditions for autonomous agency itself. When workplace hierarchies systematically deny certain workers recognition (based on gender, race, class), they damage not just opportunities but the psychological and social prerequisites for autonomy (Oshana 2006). Algorithmic management systems that make workers invisible or reduce them to data points may undermine autonomy not through overt coercion but by denying the relational conditions autonomy requires.

Young's (2006) "social connection model" of structural injustice offers a complementary framework. She argues that individuals bear responsibility for structural processes they participate in and reproduce. Workers are both constrained by and complicit in organizational structures that distribute autonomy unequally. This highlights collective dimensions—transforming autonomy-undermining structures requires collective action, not just individual choices.

Contemporary relational autonomy work (Lee 2023) continues refining how to differentiate social influences conducive to agency from those that hinder it. The challenge is acknowledging social constitution while maintaining critical bite—not all social relations equally support autonomy. Oppressive socialization, manipulative influences, and dominating power relations undermine autonomy even when individuals are embedded in relationships.

## Contemporary Developments and Debates

Recent work extends autonomy theories to contemporary challenges. Two developments merit particular attention: conceptual engineering and technology-focused autonomy research.

Haslanger's (2012) ameliorative analysis in *Resisting Reality* revolutionizes conceptual methodology. Rather than analyzing concepts as they are, Haslanger asks what concepts ought to be given normative goals. For race and gender, she shows how ameliorated concepts better serve emancipatory aims. Applied to autonomy: instead of just analyzing what "autonomy" means, we should ask what autonomy concept would best serve our practical and ethical purposes in evaluating AI-mediated work. This licenses revising autonomy concepts based on empirical findings about what matters for human flourishing in contemporary conditions.

Very recent work (2024-2025) directly addresses AI's autonomy impacts. Two papers in philosophy journals examine how recommender systems and AI decision-support affect domain-specific autonomy (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). This emerging literature recognizes that AI systems create novel threats and opportunities for autonomy requiring conceptual attention. However, most philosophical work on AI ethics has not yet deeply engaged with workplace autonomy specifically.

Bankins and Formosa (2023) provide important exception, analyzing AI's ethical implications for meaningful work in *Journal of Business Ethics*. They identify three AI deployment pathways affecting meaningful work: replacing tasks entirely, creating new "tending machine" roles, and amplifying human skills. Each pathway has different implications for autonomy, purpose, and dignity. Their framework demonstrates how philosophical analysis can engage productively with technological specifics.

## What Autonomy Requires: Synthesis

Despite disagreements, philosophical traditions converge on several requirements for autonomy:

1. **Information and transparency**: Agents need adequate information to make informed choices. Opacity and systematic deception undermine autonomy across nearly all accounts.

2. **Absence of domination and manipulation**: While accounts differ on permissible influence, all condemn manipulation that bypasses or subverts rational capacities and coercion through threats.

3. **Authentic endorsement**: Whether through identification (Frankfurt), procedural independence (Dworkin), or reflective endorsement (Christman), autonomy requires agents standing behind their choices, not merely being caused to act.

4. **Supportive social conditions**: Particularly for relational accounts, autonomy requires social recognition, adequate options, and relationships that develop rather than stunt agency.

5. **Capacity for reflection and revision**: Autonomous agents can reflect on their desires, values, and commitments, potentially revising them. Work conditions that prevent reflection or revision threaten autonomy.

These convergence points provide evaluative criteria for workplace technologies. Algorithmic management systems that create opacity, manipulate through behavioral nudges, deny recognition, limit options arbitrarily, or prevent reflection and revision threaten autonomy on multiple philosophical grounds. However, applying these general principles to specific sociotechnical systems requires empirical investigation of actual workplace conditions and worker experiences—a task philosophical work has largely not undertaken.

# Section 3: Philosophical Perspectives on Workplace Autonomy

While Section 2 examined general autonomy theories, this section addresses how philosophers have applied autonomy concepts specifically to work contexts. Three major streams dominate: meaningful work theories examining conditions under which work supports human flourishing, workplace democracy arguments about economic governance, and applied ethics analyzing employer-employee relations. These literatures connect abstract autonomy principles to concrete workplace realities, though engagement with technological mediation remains limited.

## Meaningful Work and Autonomy

Recent philosophical work establishes meaningful work as a central concern for human flourishing. Cholbi's (2022) Stanford Encyclopedia entry on "Philosophical Approaches to Work and Labor" synthesizes this literature, noting that Kantian accounts ground meaningful work in autonomy—work that is freely entered, allows independent judgment, and enables pursuit of own ends distinct from employer mandates. The entry frames meaningful work as workplace application of general autonomy requirements.

Veltman's (2016) *Meaningful Work* develops the most comprehensive philosophical account. She proposes a pluralistic framework with four elements: (1) exercise of one's capacities, (2) support of virtues including self-respect and dignity, (3) relation to urgent personal purpose or useful social purpose, and (4) connection to other important life aspects. Notably, Veltman argues people don't have a *right* to meaningful work—promoting it is an ethical matter more than political justice requirement. Her framework is pluralistic rather than monistic: meaningful work involves multiple dimensions that can trade off.

Autonomy features prominently in Veltman's account. Capacity exercise requires some control over how work is done. Self-respect and dignity depend on being treated as an agent, not mere instrument. Personal purpose requires ability to connect work to one's own values and projects. These autonomy connections suggest that work conditions systematically undermining autonomy make meaningful work impossible or severely constrained.

Schwartz's (2015) *Why We Work* offers an accessible account emphasizing discretion, meaning, and engagement. Drawing on empirical research, Schwartz argues that discretion to make decisions is essential for job satisfaction and sense of calling. People work for more than money—finding purpose linking work to broader meaning is key. His account challenges purely instrumental workplace views, arguing that engagement and autonomous judgment are intrinsically valuable, not just instrumentally useful for productivity.

Jaeggi's (2014) *Alienation* provides complementary critical theory perspective. Drawing on Hegel, phenomenology, and analytical tradition, Jaeggi reconceives alienation as absence of meaningful relationship to oneself and others. Alienated workers lack meaningful connection to what they do, experience helplessness, and accept ossified roles not authentically their own. This framework reveals how work conditions can produce alienation that undermines both autonomy and flourishing.

The meaningful work literature establishes that autonomy matters not just abstractly but concretely for whether work supports human development and purpose. However, most meaningful work theory was developed before algorithmic management's rise. Questions remain: Can algorithmically structured work be meaningful? When AI systems assign tasks and evaluate performance, do workers exercise their capacities or merely execute algorithmic directives? How does opacity about algorithmic decision-making affect connection between work and personal purpose?

## Workplace Democracy and Economic Autonomy

A second stream argues that autonomy grounds workplace democracy—if autonomy justifies democratic political governance, it should justify democratic economic governance. Dahl's (1985) *A Preface to Economic Democracy* makes this argument most directly. He develops a neo-Kantian proof for moral right to democratic voice at work: "If democracy is justified in governing the state, then it must also be justified in governing economic enterprises." We can achieve real democracy and equality without sacrificing liberty by extending democratic principles into economic order. Workers are autonomous agents deserving democratic say in institutions governing their lives.

Anderson's (2017) *Private Government* powerfully updates this argument. Based on 2015 Tanner Lectures, Anderson argues that employers are "private governments" with sweeping authoritarian power over workers' lives, on and off duty. Many workers are governed far more by workplace authority than by the state. Employers minutely regulate speech, clothing, manners, and extend authority to off-duty life—workers can be fired for political speech, recreational activities, diet. Yet we don't discuss this workplace government using political vocabulary applied to state power. Anderson advocates giving workers voice through strengthened unions and workplace democracy/co-determination. Her framework challenges acceptance of workplace authoritarianism as natural or legitimate.

Frega, Herzog, and Neuhäuser's (2019) survey of workplace democracy debates in *Philosophy Compass* maps the argumentative landscape. They identify arguments for democratizing firms based on: analogy with states (Dahl), meaningful work requirements, avoidance of unjustified hierarchies, and beneficial effects on political democracy. Countervailing arguments cite: efficiency considerations, transition difficulties, and liberal commitments to rights of employees and owners to work for or invest in non-democratic firms. The authors conclude that experiments with democratic workplaces as "real utopias" could deliver insights moving discussion forward.

Brighouse and Fleurbaey's (2010) proportionality principle offers innovative middle position. Rather than binary democracy-or-hierarchy, they propose power should be distributed proportional to people's stakes in decisions. Stakes measure how interests are affected by options, understood in terms of human flourishing not narrow finances. Applied to workplaces, workers should have proportional control over policies and governance at different levels (shop floor to boardroom) based on how decisions affect them. This framework accommodates varying stakes while avoiding both pure managerial control and uniform worker democracy.

Kwok's (2019) "Work Autonomy and Workplace Democracy" explicitly connects autonomy distribution to democratic justice. Drawing on empirical autonomy literature, Kwok argues that polarization exists between high-skilled and low-skilled labor in goods of work autonomy. This polarization offers *pro tanto* justification for workplace democracy for least advantaged workers as it can consolidate their control over work processes. Kwok bridges philosophical political theory with empirical findings, showing how autonomy inequality provides justice-based argument for institutional change.

The workplace democracy literature establishes that autonomy is not just individual psychological state but collective good requiring institutional support. If workers lack collective governance rights, their individual autonomy remains vulnerable to arbitrary employer power. However, workplace democracy arguments largely predate algorithmic management. New questions arise: What does democratic governance mean when algorithms make many managerial decisions? Can workers democratically control opaque AI systems they don't understand? Does algorithmic management represent new form of authoritarianism requiring updated democratic arguments?

## Applied Ethics and Moral Constraints on Management

Beyond meaningful work and democracy, applied ethics examines moral constraints on employer-employee relations. Herzog's (2018) *Reclaiming the System* analyzes how organizations affect moral agency and responsibility. Based on 32 interviews with workers in varied organizations, Herzog examines organizations' rule-bound character, divided knowledge, and organizational cultures' relation to morality. She introduces "transformational agency"—critical, creative engagement with organizational role while committed to basic moral norms. This concept suggests how workers can maintain autonomy within organizations through critically engaging with rather than passively accepting their roles.

Herzog's work reveals tension between organizational demands and individual moral agency. When workers are evaluated by metrics they didn't choose, following procedures they didn't design, pursuing goals they may not endorse, can they exercise transformational agency? Algorithmic management may intensify this tension by embedding decisions in opaque code, making critical engagement more difficult.

Scanlon's (1998) contractualism in *What We Owe to Each Other* provides general framework relevant to workplace ethics. Right and wrong are understood through what could be justified to others or what they could not reasonably reject. Applied to workplaces: What employment arrangements could workers reasonably reject? Workplace conditions systematically undermining autonomy and dignity might be reasonable grounds for rejection, grounding moral constraints on managerial power.

The applied ethics literature reveals how general autonomy principles translate into specific workplace moral requirements. Employers must respect workers as rational autonomous agents, not mere instruments. Management practices should be justifiable to those managed. Work should support rather than undermine capacity for moral agency. Yet connecting these principles to algorithmic systems requires empirical investigation of how such systems actually affect workers—investigation that philosophical work has largely not undertaken.

## Gaps and Limitations

Workplace philosophy makes crucial contributions but faces limitations for analyzing AI-mediated work:

**Technological specificity**: Most workplace philosophy addresses traditional employment without examining how specific technologies mediate work relationships. Meaningful work and workplace democracy arguments were developed for human managers and direct hierarchies. How they apply to algorithmic management systems with novel properties (opacity, scale, data-driven personalization) remains largely unexplored.

**Empirical grounding**: Philosophical workplace arguments often make empirical assumptions about what work conditions support autonomy and flourishing. Yet they rarely engage systematically with empirical research documenting actual worker experiences and the mechanisms linking workplace features to outcomes. This creates risk of philosophical frameworks disconnected from workplace realities.

**Power and inequality**: While Anderson and critical theorists emphasize power, much meaningful work literature treats autonomy in individualistic terms. Structural inequalities in autonomy access—by class, race, gender, immigration status—receive limited philosophical attention despite substantial empirical documentation.

**Conceptual clarity**: Philosophers use "autonomy" in diverse ways—Kantian rational self-legislation, hierarchical identification, meaningful work's capacity exercise, democracy's collective self-governance. How these different senses relate and whether they're compatible remains unclear. Algorithmic management may affect different autonomy dimensions differently, requiring conceptual precision.

Despite these limitations, workplace philosophy establishes that autonomy is not peripheral but central to work ethics. If AI systems systematically undermine conditions for meaningful work, democratic participation, and moral agency, this raises fundamental ethical concerns requiring both philosophical analysis and empirical investigation. The next section turns to how social scientists have operationalized and studied workplace autonomy empirically.

# Section 4: Social Science Perspectives on Autonomy and Work

Where philosophy asks what autonomy is and why it matters, social sciences ask how autonomy functions psychologically, how workplace features affect it, and what outcomes it predicts. Organizational psychology, sociology, and management science have generated robust empirical evidence about workplace autonomy through several major theoretical frameworks. This section surveys these perspectives, showing both their contributions and limitations for understanding AI-mediated work.

## Self-Determination Theory: Autonomy as Basic Psychological Need

Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Deci and Ryan (1985), provides the dominant motivational framework in contemporary psychology. SDT posits three basic psychological needs essential for intrinsic motivation and well-being: autonomy (experiencing volition and psychological freedom), competence (feeling effective), and relatedness (connection to others). These needs are "basic" in that their satisfaction is necessary for psychological health and optimal functioning across cultures and contexts.

SDT's most comprehensive statement appears in Ryan and Deci's (2000) *American Psychologist* article. They review research demonstrating that social contexts facilitating need satisfaction support natural processes of self-motivation and healthy development. Autonomy support (versus control) consistently predicts greater intrinsic motivation, internalization of values, and well-being. Importantly, SDT distinguishes autonomy from independence—autonomy is about volition (experiencing one's behavior as emanating from oneself), not about being separate from others. This allows SDT to recognize that autonomy can be supported through relationships and social contexts.

Gagné and Deci's (2005) application to work settings addresses how SDT translates to organizational contexts. They argue that autonomous motivation (intrinsic plus well-internalized extrinsic) predicts better outcomes than controlled motivation for complex and interesting tasks. Crucially, autonomy-supportive management facilitates internalization of initially extrinsic motivation. Managers who provide rationale, acknowledge feelings, and offer choice enable workers to internalize organizational goals as personally meaningful. This challenges simple intrinsic-extrinsic dichotomies by proposing a continuum of self-determination with different regulatory styles.

Van den Broeck et al.'s (2016) meta-analysis synthesizes 99 studies with 119 samples, providing comprehensive evidence for SDT's basic needs at work. Each need (autonomy, competence, relatedness) uniquely predicts psychological growth, internalization, and well-being. Need satisfaction mediates relationships between work characteristics and outcomes. Importantly, the three needs are not substitutable—all three are essential for optimal functioning. High autonomy cannot compensate for low competence or relatedness.

SDT's strengths for understanding workplace autonomy include: (1) empirically validated framework with robust cross-cultural evidence, (2) specification of psychological mechanisms linking autonomy to motivation and well-being, (3) recognition that autonomy is about experienced volition, not just formal independence, and (4) integration of autonomy with other needs in a comprehensive motivational theory.

However, SDT faces limitations for analyzing algorithmic management: (1) Autonomy is measured subjectively through self-reports, making it difficult to assess whether workers accurately perceive autonomy or whether adaptive preferences lead them to report autonomy under constraining conditions. (2) SDT focuses primarily on individual psychology rather than structural power relations, potentially underplaying how organizational power shapes autonomy experiences. (3) While SDT acknowledges social influence, it has less to say about manipulation and the boundary between autonomy support and control when algorithmic systems use sophisticated behavioral techniques.

## Job Design Theory: Structural Approaches to Autonomy

Where SDT focuses on psychological needs, job design theories examine how objective job characteristics affect motivation and well-being. Hackman and Oldham's (1976, 1980) Job Characteristics Model (JCM) became the foundational framework. They propose five core job dimensions: skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy (freedom, independence, and discretion in scheduling work and determining procedures), and feedback. These dimensions lead to critical psychological states—experienced meaningfulness, experienced responsibility, knowledge of results—which produce outcomes including internal work motivation, job satisfaction, and performance.

In the JCM, autonomy specifically creates experienced responsibility for outcomes. When workers have discretion over how work is done, they feel accountable for results. This responsibility experience is crucial for intrinsic motivation. The model includes moderators: growth need strength, knowledge and skills, and context satisfaction. High growth need individuals particularly benefit from enriched jobs.

Humphrey, Nahrgang, and Morgeson's (2007) meta-analysis of 259 studies with over 219,000 participants comprehensively validates and extends the JCM. They integrate motivational characteristics (JCM's five dimensions plus autonomy), social characteristics (interdependence, feedback from others, social support), and work context (ergonomics, physical demands, conditions). The fourteen work characteristics examined explain 43% of variance in worker attitudes and behaviors. Autonomy shows strong relationships with job satisfaction, growth satisfaction, and internal work motivation.

Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) operationalize these constructs in their Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ), measuring autonomy across three facets: work scheduling autonomy (control over work timing/scheduling), decision-making autonomy (discretion over job decisions), and work methods autonomy (freedom/discretion over work procedures). This multidimensional autonomy measure reveals that autonomy is not unitary—workers may have high methods autonomy but low scheduling autonomy, for instance.

Karasek's (1979) Demand-Control Model offers complementary perspective focused on occupational health. Rather than viewing autonomy primarily as motivational, Karasek positions "decision latitude" (combination of skill discretion and decision authority) as buffer against job strain. High demands plus low control produces high strain. High demands plus high control creates "active jobs" promoting learning and growth. The key insight: autonomy's effects depend on job demands. Later work (Karasek and Theorell 1990) adds social support as third dimension, developing Demand-Control-Support model.

The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) framework (Bakker and Demerouti 2007) generalizes these insights. All working conditions categorize into demands (stressors) and resources (aspects facilitating goal achievement, reducing demands, stimulating growth). Autonomy is a key job resource. Two processes operate: health impairment (demands → strain) and motivational (resources → engagement). Resources buffer demand effects and predict engagement.

Job design theories provide several advantages: (1) specification of objective job features enabling empirical measurement independent of worker perceptions, (2) robust meta-analytic evidence for autonomy's importance across diverse occupations and contexts, (3) multidimensional autonomy constructs revealing that autonomy operates across different work aspects, and (4) frameworks for understanding autonomy-demand interactions.

Limitations include: (1) Job characteristics are treated as relatively stable features, but algorithmic systems can create dynamic, personalized experiences varying within the same nominal job. (2) Traditional autonomy measures (scheduling, methods, decision-making) may miss dimensions specific to algorithmic work like data autonomy or algorithmic transparency. (3) Job design frameworks focus on immediate task level rather than broader organizational power structures shaping job design itself.

## Job Crafting and Proactive Work Behavior

While job design theories examine how jobs are structured from above, job crafting and proactivity research emphasizes employee agency in shaping work. Wrzesniewski and Dutton's (2001) foundational paper proposes that employees craft jobs by changing cognitive, task, and relational boundaries. Job crafting involves: task crafting (changing number, scope, or nature of tasks), relational crafting (changing quality or extent of workplace relationships), and cognitive crafting (changing how one thinks about job). This shifts from top-down job design to bottom-up employee agency.

Motivations for crafting include needs for control over work environment, positive self-image, and human connection. Importantly, crafting alters not just what workers do but work's meaning and workers' identities. This connects to autonomy: workers don't just receive autonomy from job design but actively create and maintain it through crafting efforts.

Tims, Bakker, and Derks (2012) operationalize job crafting within the JD-R framework, identifying four dimensions: increasing social resources, increasing structural resources (including autonomy), increasing challenging demands, and decreasing hindering demands. Their Job Crafting Scale shows good psychometric properties and reveals that employees proactively shape their jobs to optimize person-job fit.

Rudolph et al.'s (2017) meta-analysis of 122 samples with over 35,000 workers demonstrates that job crafting relates to personality, motivation, and job characteristics including autonomy. Crucially, job crafting both results from autonomy (autonomy enables crafting) and creates autonomy (crafting increases autonomy). Job crafting positively relates to engagement, satisfaction, and performance, with individual differences (proactive personality, positive affect) and job autonomy predicting crafting behaviors.

Grant and Parker's (2009) "Redesigning Work Design Theories" argues that work design theory must transform for service/knowledge economies. They propose two emerging perspectives: relational (emphasizing social embeddedness and interdependence) and proactive (capturing employee initiative in anticipating and creating changes). Traditional autonomy concepts need expansion to include relational autonomy and proactive work behaviors. The shift is from static job features to dynamic processes where workers actively shape their environments.

Parker and Bindl's (2017) comprehensive framework defines proactive behavior as self-starting, future-focused, and change-oriented. Forms include proactive voice, job crafting, career proactivity, feedback-seeking, and safety proactivity. Proactivity involves taking initiative rather than passively adapting. It's motivated by autonomous motivation (SDT), proactive personality, and situational support.

Job crafting and proactivity research reveals several important insights: (1) Workers are not passive recipients of job design but active agents shaping work experiences. (2) Autonomy has reciprocal relationships with agency—autonomy enables crafting which creates more autonomy. (3) Even under constraining conditions, workers find ways to exercise agency through crafting. (4) Individual differences matter—not all workers craft equally or in same ways.

For algorithmic management, these insights suggest workers will attempt to craft even highly algorithmic jobs. However, questions remain: How much room for crafting do algorithmic systems leave? When algorithms tightly specify tasks, monitor continuously, and evaluate performance, are crafting opportunities substantially reduced? How do workers craft around or through algorithmic constraints?

## Labor Sociology and Critical Perspectives

While psychology emphasizes individual motivation and job design, labor sociology examines autonomy within broader political economy and power relations. Braverman's (1974) *Labor and Monopoly Capital* established labor process theory's foundational argument: capitalist production systematically deskills workers and reduces autonomy through managerial control. Scientific management (Taylorism) separates conception from execution, fragmenting tasks to reduce skilled workers' power. Skill decline and autonomy loss result not from technological inevitability but from profit-seeking and management's drive for control.

Thompson and Smith (2009) defend labor process theory against marginalization claims, arguing it remains vital for understanding work transformations. Contemporary developments (globalization, service economy, knowledge work) require theory expansion but don't invalidate core insights about power, control, and autonomy as contested terrain. Workers resist managerial control even as capital seeks new control mechanisms.

Kalleberg's (2011) *Good Jobs, Bad Jobs* documents employment polarization in the United States from 1970s-2000s. "Good jobs" offer high earnings, mobility, benefits, autonomy, and security. "Bad jobs" involve low wages, few opportunities, poor benefits, high insecurity, and low autonomy. The middle is withering. Causes include deregulation, globalization, service sector growth, and weakened unions. Educational attainment is leading predictor of job quality and autonomy access.

This polarization perspective challenges views of autonomy as universally increasing or decreasing. Instead, autonomy increasingly concentrates among high-skilled knowledge workers while declining for routine cognitive and manual workers. Acemoglu and Autor's (2011) task-based framework provides economic explanation: technology substitutes for routine tasks (cognitive and manual) previously performed by middle-skill workers while complementing non-routine analytical and interpersonal tasks. This leads to job polarization—growth in high-skill and low-skill jobs, decline in middle-skill routine jobs.

Critical perspectives provide essential correctives: (1) Autonomy distribution is deeply unequal by class, race, gender, and other dimensions of stratification. (2) Workplace autonomy is shaped by power relations and political economy, not just job design choices. (3) Management constantly seeks control while workers resist, making autonomy contested terrain. (4) Technology serves management's control interests as much as or more than efficiency or worker well-being.

However, critical perspectives risk determinism, portraying workers as passive victims of capital's control strategies. Job crafting and proactivity research shows workers retain agency even under constraining conditions. The challenge is integrating critical attention to power with recognition of worker agency—avoiding both naïve voluntarism and structural determinism.

## Meaningful Work: Empirical Investigations

Empirical meaningful work research bridges philosophy and psychology. Rosso, Dekas, and Wrzesniewski's (2010) integrative review identifies four sources of meaning: the self (authenticity, self-efficacy, self-esteem), other persons (belongingness, interpersonal sensemaking), work context (including autonomy and job design), and spiritual life (transcendence, purpose). Seven mechanisms generate meaning: authenticity, self-efficacy, self-esteem, purpose, belongingness, transcendence, and cultural/interpersonal sensemaking. Autonomy enables agency and self-expression contributing to meaningfulness.

Steger, Dik, and Duffy (2012) develop the Work and Meaning Inventory (WAMI) measuring three components: positive meaning (significance and purpose in work), meaning-making through work (work as avenue for broader life meaning), and greater good motivations (work benefiting others/society). Meaningful work relates to job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and reduced distress. The validated measure enables empirical investigation of meaningful work's predictors and outcomes.

Allan et al.'s (2019) meta-analysis of 44 articles with over 23,000 participants finds meaningful work has large correlations with engagement (r=.70+), commitment, and job satisfaction, plus moderate correlations with performance, health, and lower turnover. Meaningful work partially mediates relationships between job characteristics (including autonomy) and outcomes. This establishes meaningful work as important construct affected by autonomy and affecting critical outcomes.

The empirical meaningful work literature demonstrates: (1) Meaningful work is measurable and shows robust relationships with outcomes. (2) Autonomy contributes to meaningful work but is not sufficient alone—purpose, connection, and competence also matter. (3) Meaningful work affects not just job attitudes but broader life satisfaction and health.

## Synthesis: Convergence and Gaps

Despite different theoretical origins, social science frameworks converge on several points:

**Autonomy as multidimensional**: Autonomy operates across different dimensions (scheduling, methods, decisions) and levels (task, job, career). Different theories emphasize different facets but agree autonomy isn't unitary.

**Robust autonomy effects**: Meta-analyses across frameworks consistently find autonomy predicts positive outcomes (satisfaction, engagement, performance, well-being, meaningful work). Effect sizes are substantial and robust across contexts.

**Autonomy in context**: Autonomy's effects depend on context—job demands (Karasek), other job characteristics (Hackman and Oldham), need satisfaction (SDT), and broader organizational and societal structures (labor sociology).

**Agency matters**: Workers are not passive—they craft jobs, exercise proactivity, and resist constraints. Autonomy both enables and results from these agentic behaviors.

However, significant gaps remain for understanding AI-mediated work:

**Conceptual-operational disconnect**: Philosophical autonomy concepts (identification, authenticity, self-governance) don't map cleanly onto operational measures (scheduling autonomy, decision-making authority). What's the relationship between philosophical and empirical autonomy?

**Missing dimensions**: Standard autonomy measures may not capture aspects specific to algorithmic work: data autonomy, algorithmic transparency, ability to contest automated decisions, protection from manipulation.

**Static versus dynamic**: Most research treats autonomy as stable job feature, but algorithmic systems can create dynamic, personalized experiences. How to measure and theorize autonomy that varies within-person over time?

**Structural inequality**: While some research documents autonomy polarization, the mechanisms creating and sustaining inequality in autonomy access receive insufficient attention. How do intersecting structures of race, gender, class shape autonomy distribution?

**Technology specificity**: Frameworks developed for human-managed work may not transfer to algorithmically-managed contexts without modification. Do traditional job characteristics predict outcomes similarly when mediated by algorithms versus human managers?

These gaps suggest need for empirical research specifically examining algorithmic management's autonomy effects, potentially requiring measurement innovation and conceptual refinement. Section 6 turns to existing empirical research on AI's workplace impacts.

# Section 5: Empirical Methods for Conceptual Work

The preceding sections reveal a persistent tension: philosophical sophistication about autonomy concepts paired with limited empirical grounding versus robust empirical evidence about workplace autonomy with limited conceptual depth. Bridging this divide requires methodological frameworks that can integrate empirical investigation with conceptual work. This section examines three methodological approaches: experimental philosophy for testing concepts empirically, grounded theory for developing concepts from qualitative data, and conceptual engineering for normatively improving concepts. Together, these approaches suggest pathways for empirically-informed conceptual revision.

## Experimental Philosophy: Testing Concepts Empirically

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) emerged in the early 2000s as a movement using empirical methods—surveys, experiments, behavioral studies—to test philosophical claims about concepts and intuitions. Knobe and Nichols' (2008) foundational volume *Experimental Philosophy* established the field's core methodology: systematically investigating whether philosophical theories accurately capture how people actually think about philosophical concepts.

Knobe's (2003) discovery of the "Knobe effect" exemplifies x-phi methodology. He presented participants with vignettes where a chairman knowingly but unintentionally brings about side effects—environmental harm in one version, environmental benefit in another. Despite identical epistemic structure, participants judged the harm intentional but the benefit unintentional. This demonstrates that moral judgments influence folk concepts of intentional action, contrary to philosophical theories treating intentionality as purely epistemic.

For autonomy research, x-phi offers methods for testing whether philosophical autonomy theories capture folk understanding. Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich's (2001) pioneering study found that epistemic intuitions varied by ethnicity and socioeconomic status, challenging claims that philosophical intuitions are universal. If autonomy intuitions similarly vary, this has implications for which autonomy concepts are adequate.

The Alfano et al. (2024) Stanford Encyclopedia entry on experimental moral philosophy surveys x-phi findings on moral responsibility, free will, and intentional action—all concepts closely related to autonomy. Nahmias et al.'s (2005, 2006) studies of free will intuitions found that most participants judge agents in deterministic scenarios can have free will and moral responsibility, contradicting philosophical incompatibilism. However, when determinism is described to suggest "bypassing" (mental states causally irrelevant), incompatibilist judgments emerge.

X-phi's value for autonomy research includes: (1) systematic empirical investigation of folk concepts rather than armchair theorizing, (2) discovery of factors (moral judgments, framing, cultural background) affecting intuitions, (3) methods for testing whether philosophical theories align with actual concept usage, and (4) evidence about concept variability across populations.

However, x-phi faces limitations. Cappelen (2012) in *Philosophy Without Intuitions* argues that philosophers don't actually rely much on intuitions despite methodological pronouncements. Strevens (2019) defends armchair methods using cognitive science, arguing that edge cases can generate genuine knowledge. Nado (2014) reviews evidence that philosophers themselves show biases and framing effects, complicating expertise defenses.

For workplace autonomy specifically, x-phi could test whether workers' autonomy concepts align with philosophical theories. Do workers judge autonomy violated by algorithmic opacity? Does information asymmetry affect autonomy attributions? How do workers trade off different autonomy dimensions? Yet relatively little x-phi work addresses workplace concepts directly—an important gap.

## Grounded Theory: Developing Concepts from Qualitative Data

Where x-phi tests existing concepts, grounded theory (GT) develops new concepts systematically from qualitative data. Glaser and Strauss' (1967) *The Discovery of Grounded Theory* revolutionized qualitative methodology by proposing rigorous procedures for theory generation: constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, coding, memo-writing, and pursuing analysis until theoretical saturation.

Classic GT emphasizes letting patterns emerge from data rather than imposing pre-existing frameworks. Glaser's (1978) *Theoretical Sensitivity* focuses on conceptualization rather than mere description—the goal is generating concepts and theories, not just documenting what people say. This makes GT particularly valuable for philosophical concept development from empirical materials.

However, GT evolved in multiple directions. Charmaz's (2006, 2014) constructivist GT challenges Glaser's objectivism, arguing that theories are constructed not discovered. Researchers co-construct data and theory with participants. Charmaz emphasizes reflexivity, researcher positionality, and acknowledgment that all theories reflect particular standpoints. The 2014 second edition updates methodology while maintaining constructivist commitments.

Mills, Bonner, and Francis (2006) trace constructivist GT's philosophical foundations, clarifying ontological and epistemological differences from classic GT. Constructivist GT is more compatible with normative philosophical work than objectivist versions because it acknowledges values and purposes shape concept construction. For ameliorative conceptual projects (discussed below), constructivist GT provides methodology acknowledging that concepts can be built to serve normative purposes while remaining grounded in empirical realities.

Clarke's (2005) *Situational Analysis* extends GT for postmodern contexts, adding mapping techniques (situational maps, social worlds/arenas maps, positional maps) for analyzing complex situations with multiple perspectives and power relations. This sophistication suits workplace contexts where multiple stakeholders (workers, managers, platforms, regulators) have different interests and perspectives.

For autonomy research, GT offers methods for developing autonomy concepts from worker experiences rather than importing philosophical theories wholesale. What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant features of algorithmic management? How do they make sense of control, agency, and freedom in platform contexts? What categories emerge from their accounts? GT provides systematic methods for answering these questions while developing conceptual frameworks grounded in actual experiences.

Limitations include: (1) GT was developed primarily for sociology, not philosophy—how to maintain normative philosophical goals while following GT procedures requires methodological adaptation. (2) GT's inductive orientation can make it difficult to engage critically with existing theories while remaining open to emergent concepts. (3) GT requires substantial qualitative data and analytical time, making it resource-intensive compared to conceptual analysis alone.

## Conceptual Engineering and Ameliorative Analysis

While x-phi tests existing concepts and GT develops concepts from data, conceptual engineering asks how concepts can be improved to better serve our purposes. Haslanger's (2012) *Resisting Reality* develops ameliorative analysis as revolutionary methodological intervention. Rather than analyzing what concepts like "woman" or "knowledge" currently mean, ameliorative analysis asks what they *should* mean given our normative goals.

For gender, Haslanger proposes ameliorated concepts serving emancipatory aims rather than merely describing existing usage. This licensing of normative concept revision based on practical purposes transforms conceptual methodology from purely descriptive to explicitly normative project.

Applied to workplace autonomy: instead of just analyzing what "autonomy" means philosophically or how workers currently understand it, ameliorative analysis asks what autonomy concept would best serve our practical and ethical purposes in AI-mediated work contexts. This could justify revising autonomy concepts based on empirical findings about what actually matters for human flourishing, dignity, and agency in algorithmic management contexts.

Burgess, Cappelen, and Plunkett's (2020) edited volume *Conceptual Engineering and Conceptual Ethics* establishes conceptual engineering as distinct field. Twenty chapters explore how to assess and ameliorate representational devices (concepts, words). The introduction provides a "guided tour" mapping diverse approaches from Haslanger-style amelioration to Carnapian explication.

Plunkett and Sundell's (2013) work on metalinguistic disagreement reveals that many apparent philosophical disagreements are actually about concepts themselves—negotiating what terms should mean rather than substantive facts. This suggests autonomy debates may involve metalinguistic negotiation: not just whether AI systems threaten autonomy but what "autonomy" should mean in algorithmic contexts.

Conceptual engineering's value for autonomy research includes: (1) explicit permission for normative concept revision rather than merely descriptive analysis, (2) frameworks for evaluating concepts based on how well they serve our purposes, (3) methods for improving concepts to address new phenomena (like algorithmic management) not anticipated when concepts were originally developed, and (4) integration of normative goals with conceptual precision.

Limitations include: (1) Risk of revisionary concepts becoming disconnected from existing usage and debates. (2) Disagreement about goals can make ameliorative projects controversial—whose purposes should concepts serve? (3) Balance between conceptual innovation and preserving continuity with existing frameworks is difficult to maintain. (4) Empirical investigation is needed to know what concept would actually serve purposes, but conceptual engineering literature has limited engagement with empirical methods.

## Integrating Empirical and Normative Methods

The three methodological approaches—x-phi, GT, conceptual engineering—offer complementary resources for empirically-informed conceptual work:

**X-phi** can test whether existing autonomy concepts capture folk understanding and identify factors affecting autonomy judgments. For workplace autonomy, this could reveal how opacity, information asymmetry, and algorithmic control affect autonomy attributions.

**Grounded theory** can develop new conceptual frameworks from systematic analysis of worker experiences with algorithmic management. Rather than assuming existing theories adequately capture the phenomenon, GT allows emergent categories grounded in data.

**Conceptual engineering** provides normative framework for evaluating and improving concepts. Once we know (from x-phi or GT) how autonomy is understood and (from empirical workplace research) what conditions affect flourishing, ameliorative analysis can propose revised concepts serving our purposes.

Integration could proceed as follows:

1. **Empirical investigation**: Use qualitative methods (interviews, ethnography) informed by GT to investigate worker experiences with algorithmic management. What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant? What conceptual categories emerge from their accounts?

2. **Concept testing**: Use x-phi methods to test whether philosophical autonomy theories align with folk understanding. How do workers judge autonomy under different algorithmic management conditions?

3. **Normative evaluation**: Drawing on philosophical frameworks and empirical evidence about what predicts flourishing/well-being, identify what autonomy concept would best serve our normative purposes.

4. **Conceptual revision**: Develop ameliorated autonomy concept informed by empirical findings, tested against folk understanding, and designed to serve normative purposes.

5. **Validation**: Test whether revised concept better captures what matters empirically and serves purposes better than existing alternatives.

This integrated approach combines philosophical sophistication with empirical grounding. It acknowledges that concepts must be both descriptively adequate (capturing relevant phenomena) and normatively appropriate (serving our purposes). Neither purely armchair philosophy nor theory-free empiricism suffices—integration is required.

## Methodological Challenges

Several challenges face empirically-informed conceptual work:

**Expertise and training**: Integration requires both philosophical training (in conceptual analysis, normative theory) and empirical skills (qualitative methods, experimental design). Few researchers have deep training in both.

**Institutional barriers**: Academic philosophy largely rewards armchair conceptual work, while empirical research is seen as "not really philosophy." Conversely, empirical social sciences may view philosophical conceptual work as unscientific speculation. Integrative work risks falling between disciplinary stools.

**Time and resources**: Empirical research requires time for data collection and analysis that pure conceptual work doesn't. Funding structures may not support philosophical research with empirical components.

**Evaluation criteria**: How to evaluate success in empirically-informed conceptual work? Philosophical rigor? Empirical adequacy? Practical usefulness? Clarity about success criteria is needed.

Despite challenges, methodological frameworks exist for combining empirical investigation with conceptual sophistication. The question is not whether such integration is possible but whether researchers will undertake it. For workplace autonomy and AI, the integration seems not just possible but necessary—existing purely philosophical or purely empirical approaches both face systematic limitations that integration could address.

# Section 6: AI's Impact on Workplace Autonomy: Empirical Findings

While philosophical and social science frameworks establish what autonomy is and why it matters, empirical research on algorithmic management reveals how AI systems actually affect worker autonomy, control, and agency in practice. Over the past decade, a substantial interdisciplinary literature has documented AI's workplace impacts through platform work studies, HCI research, institutional surveys, and critical ethnographies. This section synthesizes these findings, showing both how algorithmic management constrains autonomy and how workers develop strategies to navigate and resist algorithmic control.

## Algorithmic Management Frameworks: Conceptualizing AI Control

Kellogg, Valentine, and Christin's (2020) "Algorithms at Work" in *Academy of Management Annals* provides the foundational framework for understanding algorithmic management. Drawing on Edwards' contested terrain theory, they identify six mechanisms through which algorithms assume managerial functions—the "6 Rs" framework:

- **Restricting**: Algorithms limit options available to workers (Uber drivers can't see destination before accepting ride)
- **Recommending**: Algorithms suggest actions while preserving formal choice (Netflix recommendation algorithms, food delivery route suggestions)
- **Recording**: Algorithms continuously collect data on worker activities (keystroke monitoring, GPS tracking)
- **Rating**: Algorithms evaluate worker performance (customer ratings, productivity metrics)
- **Replacing**: Algorithms substitute for human decision-making (automated scheduling, task allocation)
- **Rewarding**: Algorithms determine compensation and incentives (dynamic pricing, gamification)

This framework reveals algorithmic management's multidimensionality—algorithms don't just control directly but shape work through information provision, evaluation, and reward structures. Importantly, algorithmic control can operate invisibly or indirectly, making it harder to recognize and contest than traditional hierarchical management.

Jarrahi et al. (2021) extend this framework with sociotechnical emphasis. They argue algorithmic management reflects both technological infrastructures and organizational choices—not technological determinism. Three key issues emerge: how algorithmic management reshapes power dynamics between workers and managers, how it demands new competencies while fostering opposition, and how it impacts knowledge exchange through opacity. Crucially, they demonstrate algorithmic management is spreading from platform gig economy to standard employment settings.

Lee et al.'s (2015) pioneering HCI study that coined "algorithmic management" examined Uber and Lyft, defining it as "software algorithms that assume managerial functions and surrounding institutional devices that support algorithms in practice." They identify information asymmetries as core problem—drivers cannot access information about how algorithms assign work, evaluate performance, or determine pay. Without understanding algorithmic logic, drivers struggle to make informed decisions about work strategies.

These frameworks establish several critical points: (1) Algorithmic management is not monolithic but operates through multiple mechanisms. (2) Control can be indirect—through information provision, evaluation structures, and incentive design—not just direct commands. (3) Opacity and information asymmetry are central features, not incidental bugs. (4) Algorithmic management is becoming mainstream, not confined to gig platforms.

## Platform Work and the Gig Economy: Evidence from the Field

Platform work provides the most extensively documented cases of algorithmic management. Wood et al.'s (2019) "Good Gig, Bad Gig" study of remote gig economy workers across six countries (107 interviews, N=679 survey) reveals autonomy paradoxes. Workers report high flexibility and autonomy over when and where to work, yet also experience low pay, social isolation, irregular hours, and exhaustion. The study challenges simple narratives—algorithmic management offers some autonomy dimensions (schedule flexibility) while constraining others (task control, information access). Non-proximity of workers and clients limits direct supervision, creating perceived autonomy despite algorithmic constraints.

Vallas and Schor's (2020) *Annual Review of Sociology* synthesis proposes platforms as "permissive potentates"—appearing to grant worker independence while exercising concentrated power. This captures platform paradox: workers are formally independent contractors yet face intense algorithmic management. Platforms externalize responsibility (workers bear risks, lack benefits) while centralizing control (algorithms direct, evaluate, discipline).

Rosenblat's (2018) *Uberland*, based on four years of ethnographic fieldwork riding with Uber drivers across 25+ cities, documents how Uber uses information asymmetries, customer rating surveillance, and behavioral nudges to manage drivers. Drivers experience unpredictability, gamification, and manipulation through algorithmic wage discrimination (different drivers see different pay for same ride) and surge pricing psychology. Rosenblat's work reveals platforms as traditional employers disguised as neutral marketplaces.

Gray and Suri's (2019) *Ghost Work*, a five-year study of crowdwork and Amazon Mechanical Turk, unveils invisible human labor making AI appear to work. "Ghost workers" perform high-tech piecework (content moderation, data labeling) with below-minimum wages, no benefits, and arbitrary termination ("rejections" where requesters don't pay for completed work). Workers are atomized, invisible, and excluded from labor protections. The book estimates 8% of Americans participate in this hidden economy essential for AI system functioning.

Griesbach et al.'s (2019) food delivery platform study (55 interviews, N=955 survey) documents variation in algorithmic control intensity. Instacart exerts "algorithmic despotism"—stringent regulation of time and activities through continuous monitoring and tight deadlines. Other platforms allow more discretion. This variation demonstrates that algorithmic control is not technologically determined but reflects design choices. Even within platform economy, significant variation exists in autonomy conditions.

Platform work research establishes: (1) Workers experience paradoxical autonomy—flexibility in some dimensions, constraint in others. (2) Information asymmetries systematically advantage platforms over workers. (3) Customer rating systems distribute managerial evaluation while making it difficult to contest. (4) Platforms achieve employer control without employer responsibilities through legal and technical structures. (5) Precarity and economic insecurity undermine effective autonomy even when formal choice exists.

## Institutional Data: Scale and Scope of Algorithmic Management

Recent institutional research documents algorithmic management's mainstream adoption. The OECD's (2025) first large-scale employer survey on algorithmic management surveyed 6,047 mid-level managers across six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, United States). Findings reveal stunning adoption rates: 74% of U.S. firms use software to automate managerial tasks (instructing, monitoring, evaluating). Adoption reaches 90% in U.S., 79% average across European countries sampled.

Managers perceive improved decision quality but also report trustworthiness concerns: unclear accountability, inability to follow algorithmic logic, inadequate worker health protection. Worker surveys show reduced job satisfaction, increased workloads, stress, and job insecurity associated with algorithmic management. This institutional data demonstrates algorithmic management is not fringe phenomenon but mainstream practice affecting majority of workers in advanced economies.

The ILO's work documents global dimensions. Their 2024 report on "Algorithmic Management Practices in Regular Workplaces" examines Italy, France, India, and South Africa, finding algorithmic management spreading beyond gig economy into traditional employment. The 2023 generative AI analysis (Gmyrek et al.) develops task-based methodology showing 25% of jobs face significant AI exposure. Crucially, they find augmentation more likely than full automation but significant gender and geographic disparities—women and developing-country workers more vulnerable to automating effects.

Berg et al.'s (2018) ILO survey of 3,500 crowdworkers across 75 countries on five major platforms documents global platform work conditions: low pay (often below minimum wage), unpredictable income, no social protection, high rejection rates, poor worker-client communication. Decent work deficits are substantial and systematic, not incidental. Platform architectures create these conditions structurally.

Institutional data confirms: (1) Algorithmic management affects majority of workers in advanced economies. (2) Adoption extends far beyond platform gig work to traditional employment. (3) Global scope includes both developed and developing economies, with inequality in impacts. (4) Worker well-being costs are measurable—reduced satisfaction, increased stress, greater insecurity. (5) Governance gaps exist around accountability, transparency, health protection.

## Worker Experiences and Responses: HCI and Sociotechnical Research

HCI research provides rich qualitative data on how workers experience and navigate algorithmic systems. Irani and Silberman's (2013) Turkopticon study (Best Paper at CHI 2013) analyzes Amazon Mechanical Turk as site where human computation relies on worker invisibility. Turkopticon is an activist browser extension enabling workers to publicize and evaluate relationships with requesters by inserting reviews into AMT's interface. Workers use it to share information, hold requesters accountable, and make visible power asymmetries built into platform architecture. The system demonstrates workers actively reshaping information environments despite platform constraints.

Salehi, Irani, and Bernstein's (2015) "We Are Dynamo" (CHI Honorable Mention) presents first socio-technical system supporting collective action for crowd workers. Dynamo enabled Mechanical Turk workers to collaboratively author ethical research guidelines and organize campaigns. Despite geographic dispersion and platform atomization, workers organized for better treatment. This proves worker agency and collective action are possible even under individualizing platform architectures.

Curchod et al.'s (2020) study of 77 high-performing eBay sellers in France and Belgium develops grounded theory of power asymmetries in online work. Customer evaluations create novel power dynamics where workers navigate both platform algorithms and customer assessments. Despite structural constraints and information asymmetries, workers develop agency through understanding and strategically engaging algorithmic systems.

Möhlmann et al.'s (2021) analysis of Uber distinguishes algorithmic management's matching function (connecting workers with tasks) from control function (monitoring and regulating). While matching receives attention, platforms also use algorithms for tight surveillance and manipulation. Driver interviews reveal perceived benefits (income opportunities) and constraints (surveillance, information gaps). This dual nature—coordination plus control—reflects broader tensions in platform design.

Sutherland and Jarrahi's (2019) Upwork study demonstrates workers develop "algorithmic competencies"—literacy for understanding algorithms despite information asymmetries. Three strategies emerge: sensemaking (understanding platform logic), circumventing (working around constraints), and manipulating (gaming systems to retain autonomy). Workers are not passive recipients but develop knowledge to maintain professional autonomy despite platform control. This reveals agency as actively achieved through effort, not passively given.

HCI research shows: (1) Workers experience algorithmic systems as simultaneously enabling and constraining. (2) Information asymmetry and opacity are central grievances. (3) Workers develop tools (Turkopticon), organize collectively (Dynamo), and cultivate algorithmic competencies to navigate constraints. (4) Agency persists but requires active effort and strategic navigation. (5) Visibility/invisibility affects both worker recognition and accountability.

## Beyond Platforms: AI in Traditional Workplaces

Increasingly, research examines algorithmic management in conventional employment beyond gig platforms. Delfanti's (2021) warehouse research, combining patent analysis with ethnographic observation, reveals Amazon's vision of "humanly extended automation" where humans and robots are intimately integrated with both managed by algorithmic systems. Patents portray machines increasing worker surveillance and work rhythms while incorporating workers' activities into machinery for "digital Taylorism." Automation reshapes rather than eliminates human work, intensifying pace and control.

Ajunwa's (2020, 2021) legal scholarship examines algorithmic hiring and workplace monitoring as "black boxes" lacking transparency and accountability. Digital discrimination affects millions who often don't know they're algorithmically assessed. Opacity prevents workers from understanding, contesting, or correcting automated decisions. Ajunwa advocates auditing requirements and transparency safeguards, informing Congressional testimony and policy debates.

The OECD (2025) data on algorithmic management in traditional employment shows adoption across sectors: manufacturing, logistics, services, knowledge work. Not just physical labor but professional work increasingly involves algorithmic evaluation, task assignment, and performance monitoring. European Working Conditions Survey (2024) finds 42.3% of EU workers report algorithmic management.

Krzywdzinski's (2021) automotive industry analysis (1990s-2018) across US, Germany, and Japan questions automation employment threat narratives. Despite heavy robotization, production employment persists. Automation doesn't uniformly eliminate jobs but reshapes occupational composition differently across national contexts. Social choices about automation implementation matter—not technological determinism.

Research on traditional workplace AI reveals: (1) Algorithmic management extends across sectors and occupation types. (2) Digital Taylorism—fragmentation, intensification, tight control—characterizes some implementations. (3) Hiring algorithms create discrimination risks often invisible to applicants. (4) Even professional knowledge work increasingly faces algorithmic evaluation and monitoring. (5) Implementation varies by organizational choice and national context, not just technology.

## Synthesis: Empirical Patterns in AI's Autonomy Impacts

Across platform work, traditional employment, global contexts, and sectors, several empirical patterns emerge:

**Information asymmetry is systematic**: Workers consistently lack information about how algorithms assign work, evaluate performance, set pay, and make decisions affecting them. This is not incidental but architected into systems.

**Autonomy is paradoxical**: Workers experience increased autonomy in some dimensions (schedule flexibility, location independence) while facing decreased autonomy in others (task control, methods, contestation of decisions). Simple increase/decrease framing misses multidimensionality.

**Control becomes indirect**: Algorithms control not just through direct commands but through information provision, evaluation structures, behavioral nudges, and economic incentives. This indirect control can be harder to recognize and contest than traditional supervision.

**Worker agency persists**: Despite constraints, workers develop algorithmic competencies, organize collectively, create counter-technologies (Turkopticon), and craft work within algorithmic systems. Agency is active achievement, not passive receipt.

**Impacts are unequal**: Algorithmic management affects workers differently by occupation, sector, geography, race, gender, and immigration status. Inequality in autonomy access and exposure to algorithmic control is substantial and structured.

**Scale is significant**: Majority of workers in advanced economies now work under some form of algorithmic management. This is mainstream phenomenon affecting labor markets broadly, not confined to tech sector or gig platforms.

**Governance gaps exist**: Legal frameworks (employment classification, privacy, discrimination law) and organizational practices (transparency, accountability, worker voice) lag behind technological deployment. Workers lack adequate protections and recourse.

These empirical findings establish that AI's workplace impacts are neither uniformly positive (techno-optimist augmentation) nor uniformly negative (techno-pessimist displacement). Instead, algorithmic management creates new configurations of autonomy and control, with effects varying by design choices, organizational contexts, regulatory frameworks, and worker responses. Understanding these impacts requires attention to specifics—which autonomy dimensions, for which workers, under what conditions?

Importantly, empirical research demonstrates that existing autonomy frameworks—both philosophical and social scientific—were not developed with these specific conditions in mind. Information asymmetry at this scale, indirect algorithmic control, continuous surveillance and data collection, personalized algorithmic treatment, and opacity about decision logic represent conditions that challenge conceptual adequacy of traditional autonomy theories. The empirical evidence makes a strong case that conceptual work is needed—not just applying existing frameworks but potentially revising them to adequately capture what's at stake in algorithmically mediated work.

# Section 7: Critical Perspectives and Worker Resistance

While Section 6 documented empirical findings on algorithmic management's impacts, critical political economy and labor process theory situate these developments within broader transformations of capitalism, power relations, and worker struggle. This section examines three critical perspectives: platform capitalism and surveillance capitalism frameworks analyzing algorithmic management's political economy, labor process theory connecting contemporary AI control to historical management strategies, and research on worker resistance revealing how workers collectively organize against and through algorithmic systems.

## Platform Capitalism and Surveillance Capitalism

Srnicek's (2017) *Platform Capitalism* traces platform emergence to the 1970s downturn in manufacturing profitability. Platforms represent capital's response to declining profit rates—new business models extracting value through data rather than traditional production. Srnicek defines platforms as digital infrastructures enabling multi-sided interaction between users. He identifies five platform types: advertising (Google, Facebook), cloud (Salesforce), industrial (GE), product (Spotify), and lean (Uber, Airbnb).

Data is platform capitalism's lifeblood. Platforms accumulate behavioral data to optimize engagement, target advertising, and develop machine learning. Lean platforms (Uber, Airbnb) minimize asset ownership while maximizing data collection and algorithmic control—they own neither cars nor housing but control interfaces mediating access. This business model requires intense information asymmetry: platforms know vastly more about workers, customers, and markets than any individual participant.

Platform capitalism framework reveals algorithmic management as not just technological development but economic strategy for capital accumulation. Control through algorithms serves profit maximization, not just efficiency. Data extraction from workers (location, behavior, performance metrics) generates value platforms capture through better matching algorithms, dynamic pricing, and performance management. Workers are simultaneously labor inputs and data sources.

Zuboff's (2019) *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* develops parallel analysis focused on behavioral data extraction. She defines surveillance capitalism as new form of capitalist accumulation that unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for behavioral data extraction. Data are transformed into "behavioral surplus" through machine intelligence and fabricated into prediction products sold to business customers. In workplace applications, wearable technology and performance monitoring extract behavioral data for managerial control and behavioral modification.

Zuboff argues this represents fundamentally new power asymmetry and threat to human autonomy and democracy. Surveillance capitalism doesn't just observe behavior but shapes it through behavioral nudges, gamification, and algorithmic manipulation. The logic is totalizing—all experience becomes potential data for extraction, all behavior potential target for modification. Workers become "human natural resources" whose behaviors are mined and shaped without their consent or knowledge.

Both frameworks emphasize that algorithmic management must be understood within political economy of data extraction and capital accumulation. Technical features—opacity, information asymmetry, continuous monitoring—are not bugs but features serving economic imperatives. Platforms need workers to lack information platforms possess because information asymmetry enables more efficient extraction. Opacity serves power.

These analyses challenge technology-neutral framing of algorithmic management as mere "digital tools." Instead, they reveal algorithmic systems as implementing specific economic logics and power relations. For autonomy analysis, this suggests that autonomy threats from algorithmic management aren't incidental side effects of technology but structural features of how platform capitalism operates.

## Labor Process Theory: Historical Continuities and Digital Taylorism

Labor process theory, initiated by Braverman's (1974) *Labor and Monopoly Capital*, analyzes how capitalist production systematically deskills workers and reduces autonomy through managerial control. Scientific management (Taylorism) separates conception from execution, fragmenting tasks to reduce skilled workers' power. Skill decline and autonomy loss result from profit-seeking and management's drive for control over labor process, not technological inevitability.

Gandini's (2019) "Labour Process Theory and the Gig Economy" applies this framework to platforms. Feedback, ranking, and rating systems serve purposes of managerialization and monitoring parallel to twentieth-century control strategies. Contemporary algorithmic management represents latest iteration of capitalist control, not fundamentally new phenomenon. Just as Taylorism decomposed craft labor into timed, measured tasks, algorithmic management fragments gig work into micro-tasks, continuously monitored and rated.

Aneesh's (2009) concept of "algocracy"—organizational governance through programming and algorithms rather than bureaucratic rules or market prices—provides theoretical framework. Algocracy is distinct from bureaucracy (legal-rational authority) and markets (price mechanisms). Information technologies constrain human participation in decision-making through algorithmic governance. This establishes algorithmic control as novel organizational form, not just application of existing logics.

Delfanti's (2021) Amazon warehouse patent analysis reveals "digital Taylorism"—algorithmic systems that rationalize labor processes through detailed surveillance and work intensification. Patents show machines incorporating workers' activities into machinery, treating human labor as component of larger algorithmic systems. "Humanly extended automation" integrates humans and machines under algorithmic coordination, with humans performing tasks not yet automatable.

Labor process theory contributions include: (1) Historical grounding showing algorithmic management as continuation of management control strategies, not radical break. (2) Emphasis on power and conflict—autonomy is contested terrain where management seeks control and workers resist. (3) Focus on deskilling and fragmentation as deliberate strategies serving capital's interests. (4) Attention to how control mechanisms evolve while serving consistent purposes.

Critics argue labor process theory risks determinism, portraying workers as passive victims. However, labor process theorists like Thompson and Smith (2009) emphasize that control always generates resistance. Workers' agency in developing counter-strategies is central to labor process analysis, not absent from it. The framework reveals structural constraints while acknowledging ongoing struggles over workplace control.

## Worker Resistance and Collective Action

Despite—or perhaps because of—algorithmic management's control intensity, worker resistance and organizing are emerging globally. Cini's (2023) "Resisting Algorithmic Control" examines platform worker mobilizations through comparative analysis of crowdwork (Amazon Mechanical Turk) and work-on-demand (food delivery). Workers develop specific organizing modes, action repertoires, and collective solidarities adapted to platform contexts. The paper challenges narratives that algorithmic control atomizes workers and prevents collective action.

"Algoactivism"—worker activism targeting algorithmic management systems—takes diverse forms: strikes demanding better pay and employment status, platform cooperatives offering worker-owned alternatives, online forums for sharing information and organizing (Turkopticon), and legal challenges to worker classification and algorithmic practices. Cini documents global strikes by food delivery couriers, Uber drivers, and other platform workers demanding labor rights.

Cant's (2019) *Riding for Deliveroo* provides first-person ethnographic account from inside worker organizing. Based on eight months working as Deliveroo rider and participating in strikes in Brighton, Cant uses workers' inquiry method assuming workers' perspective. He reveals transnational networks of encrypted chats and informal groups coordinating strikes and protests. Workers describe "tearing up rulebook and taking back control" through grassroots organizing.

Cant challenges narrative of atomized, helpless platform workers. Instead, he documents workers building solidarity despite platform fragmentation. Shared experiences of algorithmic control—arbitrary deactivations, pay changes without notice, opaque evaluation—become basis for collective identity and action. Workers develop sophisticated understanding of platform economics and leverage points for pressure (e.g., striking during peak demand).

Cameron and Rahman's (2022) three-year study of two platform companies (RideHail and FindWork) examines control-resistance relationship. They argue platforms' algorithmically-mediated customer control extends service encounters temporally and spatially, broadening span of both organizational control and workers' resistance. Resistance is not just reactive but co-constituted with control mechanisms. Workers resist through multiple tactics across expanded domains.

Salehi et al.'s (2015) Dynamo platform demonstrates how socio-technical design can support worker collective action. Dynamo enabled dispersed crowdworkers to collaboratively author guidelines and organize campaigns. Workers used it to humanize themselves in public imagination and advocate for better treatment. The system proves that technology can support rather than undermine worker autonomy when designed for collective empowerment, not just management efficiency.

Dubal's (2023) research on "algorithmic wage discrimination" reveals Uber's use of granular worker data to implement unpredictable, personalized pay. From workers' perspectives, this creates "gamification" and "gambling"—pay variability prevents collective wage standards. Workers describe algorithmic wage-setting as manipulative and discriminatory. Yet this same opacity becomes target for organizing—workers share information about pay variations and demand transparency.

Worker resistance research establishes: (1) Collective action persists despite platform atomization—workers find ways to organize adapted to digital contexts. (2) Shared experiences of algorithmic control become basis for solidarity and collective identity. (3) Workers combine traditional tactics (strikes, protests) with new strategies (online organizing, counter-technologies, algorithmic literacy). (4) Resistance operates at multiple levels: individual navigation (algorithmic competencies), counter-technologies (Turkopticon), collective organizing (unions, cooperatives), legal challenges, and platform alternatives. (5) Worker agency is not just defensive but creative—workers build new organizational forms and solidarities.

## Integration: Structure and Agency Under Algorithmic Management

Critical perspectives and resistance research together reveal dialectical relationship between algorithmic control and worker agency. Platform capitalism and surveillance capitalism frameworks show structural forces driving algorithmic management: profit imperatives, data extraction logic, and power asymmetries. Labor process theory situates contemporary control within historical trajectory of management strategies. These structural analyses risk implying worker powerlessness.

Yet resistance research demonstrates worker agency remains central. Workers develop algorithmic competencies, create counter-technologies, organize collectively, and challenge both individual algorithmic decisions and broader platform power. Agency is neither eliminated by algorithmic control nor automatically guaranteed—it must be actively cultivated through effort, solidarity, and strategic action.

This integration challenges both technological determinism (algorithms inevitably control) and voluntarism (individual workers can always resist). Instead, algorithmic management creates structural constraints and power asymmetries while workers develop forms of resistance and collective power. Outcomes depend on ongoing struggles, not predetermined by technology.

For autonomy analysis, critical perspectives reveal that autonomy is not just individual psychological state but is shaped by political economy, embedded in power relations, and achieved through collective struggle. Philosophical and psychological autonomy frameworks often treat autonomy individualistically, missing these structural and collective dimensions. Labor process theory and resistance research show autonomy must be understood politically—as contested terrain where control and resistance interact.

The critical insight is that evaluating algorithmic management requires analyzing not just technical features but their embedding in capitalist relations, management control strategies, and worker resistance. Autonomy under algorithmic management is neither simply present nor absent but is contested, with outcomes depending on power relations, regulatory frameworks, and worker collective action. This political understanding of autonomy is often missing from both philosophical and mainstream social scientific frameworks.

# Section 8: Synthesis: Key Debates and Theoretical Tensions

The preceding review reveals not just accumulated knowledge but unresolved tensions between theoretical frameworks, methodological approaches, and normative commitments. This section synthesizes five major debates that structure research on autonomy and AI-mediated work. These are not merely academic disagreements but reflect deeper questions about what autonomy requires, how to study it, and how to evaluate workplace technologies. Understanding these tensions is essential for productive path forward.

## Procedural versus Substantive Autonomy in Algorithmic Contexts

A central philosophical debate—whether autonomy requires only procedural conditions (authentic identification, proper deliberation processes) or also substantive conditions (adequate valuable options, normative competence)—becomes especially acute in algorithmic management contexts.

**Procedural autonomy** theories (Dworkin 1988; Christman 2009) hold that autonomy depends on *how* preferences form, not their content. Workers who authentically identify with their work motivations—even if those motivations were influenced by organizational culture or algorithmic nudges—would count as autonomous if the identification process met procedural requirements (reflective endorsement, absence of manipulation).

Applied to algorithmic management: If platform workers identify with goals of maximizing ratings and income, procedural accounts might judge them autonomous even if algorithmic systems shaped those goals through gamification and behavioral design. The question is whether workers reflectively endorse these goals, not whether the goals are objectively valuable.

**Substantive autonomy** theories (Raz 1986; Wolf 1990) argue that autonomy requires adequate valuable options and some capacity to appreciate reasons. Mere procedural correctness is insufficient if one's options are impoverished or one lacks capability to recognize what's valuable. Raz's "adequate range of valuable options" requirement suggests that workers in highly constrained algorithmic systems may lack autonomy even if they endorse their choices, because available options aren't genuinely good.

Applied to algorithmic management: Ghost workers on Mechanical Turk who identify with earning subsistence wages through repetitive micro-tasks might lack autonomy on substantive accounts because their options are inadequate—no healthcare, no job security, below-minimum wages, no meaningful skill development. The work doesn't support human flourishing even if workers "choose" it under constrained circumstances.

**The tension**: Procedural accounts risk accepting adaptive preferences—workers internalizing and identifying with preferences formed under oppressive conditions. Platform workers who accept precarity and low pay because they have no alternatives might procedurally count as autonomous despite objectively poor conditions. Substantive accounts risk paternalism—external judgments that workers' choices aren't "truly" autonomous because options aren't valuable enough by some standard.

**Algorithmic management sharpens the debate**: Sophisticated behavioral design and gamification can shape preferences while maintaining plausible deniability about manipulation. Workers "choose" to maximize gamified metrics, but these choices are architected by algorithmic systems designed to elicit specific behaviors. Are these autonomous choices? The answer depends on whether we prioritize procedural authenticity or substantive option quality.

Recent empirical work complicates both sides. Dubal's (2023) findings on algorithmic wage discrimination show workers experiencing pay-setting as "gambling"—their own descriptions suggest they don't identify with the situation, undermining procedural autonomy claims. Yet workers continue platform work, suggesting either adaptive preferences or constraints that make exit impossible. Neither purely procedural nor purely substantive accounts fully capture this complexity.

## Individual versus Relational Autonomy Under Algorithmic Management

A second major tension concerns whether autonomy is fundamentally individual or relational. Traditional liberal theories (Mill 1859; Kant 1785) emphasize individual rational agency, while feminist relational autonomy theorists (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000; Westlund 2009) argue autonomy is socially constituted through relationships.

**Individualistic autonomy** frameworks, dominant in psychology and organizational research, measure autonomy through individual workers' experienced control, decision-making authority, and work methods discretion (Morgeson and Humphrey 2006). The Job Characteristics Model treats autonomy as individual job feature. Self-Determination Theory measures autonomy through individual need satisfaction (Ryan and Deci 2000). These approaches assume autonomy is property of individual workers that organizational conditions either support or constrain.

**Relational autonomy** approaches argue autonomy is constituted through social relationships, recognition, and dialogical interaction (Westlund 2009; Benson 1994). Oshana (2006) emphasizes external social conditions—not just internal psychological states—as essential for autonomy. Autonomy requires social recognition, adequate standing in relationships, and participation in communities of mutual respect. An isolated individual, however psychologically integrated, lacks autonomy if social conditions deny them recognition or status.

**Algorithmic management illuminates relational dimensions**: Platform architectures structure social relationships asymmetrically. Customer rating systems make workers accountable to customers without reciprocal accountability (Curchod et al. 2020). Algorithmic opacity prevents dialogical interaction—workers cannot engage in reasoning with systems, only comply or exit. Information asymmetries structure what workers can know and therefore what choices they can make. These are fundamentally relational conditions, not just individual psychological states.

Moreover, worker invisibility in crowdwork (Irani and Silberman 2013) demonstrates how social non-recognition undermines autonomy. Ghost workers are invisible, unacknowledged, denied status as workers—conditions that relational theories suggest undermine autonomy regardless of individual psychological states. Conversely, collective organizing (Cant 2019; Cini 2023) reveals how solidarity and mutual recognition support autonomy—workers gain agency through collective action, not just individual choices.

**The tension**: Individualistic approaches have methodological advantages—measuring individual autonomy is more tractable than assessing complex relational conditions. They align with liberal political commitments to individual rights. But they may miss how algorithmic management undermines autonomy through relational mechanisms: denying recognition, preventing dialogue, structuring asymmetric power relations.

Relational approaches better capture social dimensions but face challenges in specifying which relationships support versus undermine autonomy. Not all social influence enhances autonomy—manipulation and domination are also relational. The challenge is distinguishing autonomy-supporting from autonomy-undermining relationships without collapsing into individualism.

**Integration possibility**: Perhaps both are necessary. Individual psychological integration (identification, reflective endorsement) is insufficient without supportive relational conditions (recognition, dialogical possibility, adequate social standing). Conversely, supportive social conditions don't guarantee autonomy if individuals cannot psychologically integrate experiences into coherent agency. Algorithmic management threatens both dimensions—individual integration through opacity and behavioral manipulation, relational conditions through asymmetric power and denied recognition.

## Control versus Autonomy: Distinct or Inversely Related?

Empirical workplace research often treats control and autonomy as inverse—more managerial control means less worker autonomy. But this relationship is conceptually and empirically more complex than simple inverse relation.

**Job design theories** often position autonomy as opposite of managerial control. Karasek's (1979) Demand-Control Model treats "decision latitude" (autonomy) as buffer against job demands. The implicit model: high managerial control reduces worker autonomy; high worker autonomy reduces managerial control. This zero-sum framing suggests control and autonomy compete.

**Algorithmic management complicates this**: Kellogg et al.'s (2020) "6 Rs" framework reveals control operates through multiple mechanisms—restricting, recommending, recording, rating, replacing, rewarding. Some mechanisms (restricting, replacing) directly reduce autonomy by limiting options or removing discretion. But others (recommending, rating, rewarding) operate indirectly through information provision and incentives while formally preserving choice.

Workers might have high formal autonomy (can choose when to work, which tasks to accept) while facing intense algorithmic control (continuous monitoring, opaque evaluation, dynamic pricing manipulation). Wood et al.'s (2019) finding that platform workers report both high autonomy and intense control suggests these aren't simple inverses but can coexist.

**Conceptual distinction**: Control might be better understood as *constraint on autonomy* when it limits options or imposes decisions, but *context for autonomy* when it provides structure within which autonomous choices occur. Some organizational control—clear expectations, adequate resources, appropriate feedback—may support rather than undermine autonomy by clarifying what autonomous choice means in organizational context.

Conversely, removing all control doesn't necessarily enhance autonomy. Workers who lack guidance, resources, or organizational support may experience "too much autonomy" as burdensome rather than liberating (though empirical evidence for this is limited). The question is not just control amount but control *type*—directive versus supportive, transparent versus opaque, dialogical versus monological.

**The tension for algorithmic management**: If control and autonomy aren't simple inverses, how should we evaluate algorithmic systems? Some algorithmic control (automated scheduling that optimizes worker preferences, algorithms that match workers to suitable tasks) might support autonomy. Other control (opaque evaluation, manipulative behavioral nudges, arbitrary deactivation) clearly undermines it. Distinguishing supportive from undermining control requires conceptual clarity autonomy theories often lack.

## Deskilling versus Upskilling: Technology's Trajectory

Labor economists, sociologists, and technologists disagree about whether AI/automation primarily deskills or upskills work. This debate has both empirical and normative dimensions with implications for autonomy.

**Deskilling thesis** (Braverman 1974; Delfanti 2021) argues technology serves management's interest in reducing workers' skill-based bargaining power. Automation fragments complex tasks into simple components requiring less training and judgment. Algorithmic management is "digital Taylorism"—decomposing work into measured, monitored micro-tasks. Platform crowdwork epitomizes deskilling: complex cognitive labor reduced to micro-tasks anyone can perform with minimal training.

Evidence supporting deskilling: Mechanical Turk tasks are often below-minimum-wage piecework requiring little skill (Gray and Suri 2019). Warehouse automation integrates humans into machine rhythms, reducing judgment and increasing routinization (Delfanti 2021). Food delivery algorithms tightly specify routes and timings, reducing drivers' discretionary judgment (Griesbach et al. 2019).

**Upskilling thesis** (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Autor et al. 2022) argues technology complements skilled labor, enhancing capabilities and creating demand for workers who can work with advanced systems. AI augments human judgment rather than replacing it. Workers develop new skills working with algorithmic systems—what Sutherland and Jarrahi (2019) call "algorithmic competencies."

Evidence supporting upskilling: Some platform work requires sophisticated judgment (e.g., high-end freelancing on Upwork). Workers develop navigation skills, platform literacy, and strategic understanding. Krzywdzinski's (2021) automotive industry research shows automation doesn't eliminate skilled workers but reshapes skill requirements. Human-AI collaboration in some contexts enhances worker capabilities.

**The reality is polarization** (Kalleberg 2011; Acemoglu and Autor 2011): Technology simultaneously deskills routine work while increasing returns to non-routine cognitive skills. Job polarization creates both high-skill, high-autonomy jobs and low-skill, low-autonomy jobs while hollowing out the middle. The question isn't whether technology generally deskills or upskills but *which workers* experience which trajectory.

**Autonomy implications**: Deskilling reduces autonomy by limiting discretion, judgment, and skill application. Workers executing algorithmic directives without understanding or input lack autonomy. Upskilling can enhance autonomy by expanding capabilities and options. But this assumes skill enhancement comes with commensurate control—workers might develop sophisticated skills while still facing algorithmic control limiting their application.

Acemoglu and Restrepo's (2019) task-based framework—automation displaces labor from tasks but new task creation can reinstate labor—provides more nuanced view. The balance between displacement and reinstatement effects determines outcomes. Importantly, this balance isn't technologically determined but shaped by institutional choices, power relations, and policy frameworks.

## Philosophical versus Empirical Approaches: Integration or Incommensurability?

A final tension concerns whether philosophical and empirical approaches can be productively integrated or represent incommensurable research traditions.

**Philosophical approaches** analyze concepts, develop normative theories, and examine implications. They ask what autonomy *is*, what it *requires*, and why it *matters*. Methods are conceptual analysis, thought experiments, normative argument. Success criteria include conceptual clarity, internal consistency, normative plausibility, and capacity to illuminate difficult cases.

**Empirical approaches** measure autonomy, test predictions, and document impacts. They ask how autonomy *operates* psychologically, what *predicts* it, and what *outcomes* it produces. Methods are surveys, experiments, ethnography, statistical analysis. Success criteria include empirical accuracy, generalizability, replicability, and practical applicability.

**Apparent tensions**: Philosophical concepts may be too abstract or idealized for empirical operationalization. Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical mesh—identification with first-order desires through second-order volitions—is conceptually rich but empirically difficult to measure. Conversely, empirical measures may capture important phenomena without philosophical depth about what makes autonomy valuable or when it's genuinely present versus merely apparent.

Experimental philosophy (Section 5) challenges this divide by testing philosophical theories empirically. But x-phi itself is controversial—does testing folk intuitions constrain or inform philosophical theorizing? If folk concepts differ from philosophical ones, which should guide normative evaluation?

**Integration strategies**: Several possibilities for productive integration exist:

1. **Conceptual engineering approach** (Haslanger 2012): Use empirical research to inform normative concept revision. Discover empirically what conditions support human flourishing, then revise autonomy concepts to capture what matters practically while maintaining philosophical sophistication.

2. **Grounded theory approach** (Charmaz 2014): Develop conceptual frameworks systematically from empirical data—worker experiences, ethnographic observation—while bringing philosophical resources to interpretation and theoretical development.

3. **Pragmatist integration**: Evaluate both philosophical concepts and empirical measures based on practical consequences. Which autonomy concept, when operationalized and tested, best predicts outcomes we care about? Which empirical measures best capture what philosophical theories identify as important?

4. **Domain-specific concepts**: Perhaps workplace autonomy requires concepts distinct from autonomy in personal relationships, medical decisions, or political participation. Different domains might need different concepts, informed by domain-specific empirical research.

**The deepest challenge**: Can normative and descriptive projects be genuinely integrated without one colonizing the other? Purely normative philosophy risks irrelevance to actual conditions. Purely descriptive research lacks evaluative frameworks. But integration risks either reducing philosophical depth to empirical tractability or subordinating empirical accuracy to normative purposes.

For algorithmic management, this tension is acute. Philosophical theories provide normative resources for critique—arguing that algorithmic opacity violates autonomy requirements, that information asymmetry undermines informed consent, that behavioral manipulation is dignity-violating. But without empirical investigation of how algorithmic systems actually work and affect workers, philosophical arguments remain abstract. Conversely, empirical documentation of algorithmic management's harms—increased stress, reduced satisfaction, precarity—needs normative frameworks for interpretation and evaluation.

## Synthesis: Productive Tensions

These five debates—procedural versus substantive, individual versus relational, control versus autonomy, deskilling versus upskilling, philosophical versus empirical—are not problems to solve definitively but productive tensions to navigate. Each tension reveals important dimensions of autonomy that simple resolution would obscure.

Rather than choosing one side, research should acknowledge the insights each brings while remaining alert to limitations. Autonomy likely requires both procedural authenticity and substantive options. It's both individually experienced and relationally constituted. Control and autonomy can coexist in complex relationships. Technology simultaneously deskills some work and upskills other work. Philosophical and empirical approaches each contribute essential perspectives.

The challenge for research on AI and workplace autonomy is integrating these perspectives while maintaining their distinct contributions. Section 9 turns to identifying specific research gaps this integration could address.

# Section 9: Research Gaps and Implications for Conceptual Revision

The preceding review establishes substantial knowledge about autonomy in philosophy and social sciences and about AI's workplace impacts empirically. Yet it also reveals systematic gaps—limitations in existing frameworks that empirically-informed conceptual revision could address. This section identifies four major gap categories and argues that these gaps collectively make the case for reconceptualizing workplace autonomy in light of algorithmic management's realities.

## Gap 1: Philosophical Theories Developed Without AI in Mind

The most fundamental gap is historical: dominant autonomy theories were developed before algorithmic management existed. Kant's (1785) rational self-legislation, Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical mesh, Dworkin's (1988) procedural independence, and even contemporary relational approaches (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000) were formulated for different contexts. They address questions about whether determinism threatens free will, how socialization affects preference formation, and when paternalistic interference is justified—not how algorithmic opacity, information asymmetry, and behavioral nudges affect autonomous agency.

This temporal gap creates conceptual gaps. Philosophical theories lack resources for addressing:

**Algorithmic opacity**: Traditional theories assume agents can understand forces affecting them, even if that understanding is partial. But algorithmic opacity can make understanding impossible—not through deliberate concealment alone but through genuine technical complexity, proprietary secrecy, and system dynamics even designers don't fully grasp. What does "reasons-responsiveness" (Wolf 1990) mean when the system governing one's work is opaque to reason?

**Continuous surveillance and data extraction**: Philosophers have analyzed observation and monitoring, but not continuous automated data collection at scale where behavioral surplus is extracted for prediction markets (Zuboff 2019). Traditional autonomy theories don't address whether constant surveillance undermines the privacy conditions autonomy requires, or whether being treated as data source rather than agent violates dignity.

**Personalized algorithmic treatment**: Dubal's (2023) algorithmic wage discrimination—different workers receiving different pay for identical work based on algorithmic profiles—creates conditions earlier theories didn't anticipate. Can workers be autonomous when they receive personalized information, pricing, and opportunities designed to maximize their compliance? Traditional manipulation concepts assume interpersonal relationships, not algorithmic behavioral design at scale.

**Indirect control through information and incentives**: Kellogg et al.'s (2020) framework reveals control operates through recommending, recording, rating, and rewarding—not just restricting and replacing. These indirect mechanisms formally preserve choice while shaping it through information provision and incentive structures. Do they violate autonomy? Traditional theories focusing on coercion and manipulation may not clearly classify these cases.

Recent philosophical work begins addressing AI and autonomy (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b; Bankins and Formosa 2023), but workplace autonomy specifically receives limited attention. Most AI ethics work focuses on bias, privacy, or existential risk rather than labor conditions and worker autonomy. This gap means philosophical resources for evaluating and critiquing algorithmic management remain underdeveloped.

## Gap 2: Empirical Autonomy Research Lacks Conceptual Depth

While philosophical theories lack empirical grounding in AI contexts, empirical workplace autonomy research lacks philosophical depth. Organizational psychology measures autonomy through work scheduling autonomy, decision-making autonomy, and work methods autonomy (Morgeson and Humphrey 2006). These operational measures are useful but conceptually thin.

**Missing dimensions**: Standard measures may not capture autonomy dimensions specific to algorithmic work: data autonomy (control over how one's data is used), algorithmic transparency (ability to understand systems governing work), contestation rights (ability to challenge automated decisions), protection from manipulation (safeguards against behavioral nudges). Existing measures were developed for human-managed work and may miss what's distinctive about algorithmic management.

**Conceptual clarity about autonomy types**: Empirical research distinguishes autonomy dimensions (scheduling, methods, decisions) without philosophical clarity about how these relate to autonomy as such. Are these equally important aspects of a unitary autonomy construct, or distinct forms of autonomy with different normative significance? Why does autonomy over work methods matter morally—is it instrumental for other goods or intrinsically valuable?

**Adaptive preferences problem**: Self-report autonomy measures ask workers whether they experience autonomy. But what if workers adapt preferences to constrained conditions, reporting autonomy under objectively restricting circumstances? Philosophical work on adaptive preferences (Elster, Nussbaum) could inform empirical measurement, but integration remains limited. Without conceptual resources for distinguishing genuine from adaptive autonomy experiences, empirical measures may miss autonomy violations.

**Autonomy's moral significance**: Empirical research documents that autonomy predicts satisfaction, engagement, and performance (Humphrey et al. 2007; Van den Broeck et al. 2016). But why does autonomy matter morally? Is it valuable only instrumentally for these outcomes, or does it have intrinsic value grounded in human dignity? Empirical research rarely addresses these normative questions, leaving it unclear how to trade off autonomy against other goods.

This gap means empirical workplace autonomy research, while robust, may miss conceptually important aspects while measuring what's tractable rather than what's most significant.

## Gap 3: Limited Integration Across Philosophical and Empirical Domains

Beyond each domain's internal gaps, systematic integration gaps exist between philosophical and empirical research.

**Conceptual-operational mismatch**: Philosophical concepts (identification, authenticity, self-governance) don't map straightforwardly onto empirical measures (scheduling autonomy, decision authority). The relationship between philosophical autonomy and empirically measured workplace autonomy remains unclear. Are they measuring the same thing at different levels of abstraction? Different aspects of a broader phenomenon? Or partially overlapping but distinct concepts?

Herzog's (2018) work on transformational agency—critical, creative engagement with organizational roles—exemplifies integration potential. She combines philosophical analysis with 32 worker interviews, developing concepts grounded in both normative theory and lived experience. But such integration is rare. Most philosophical work proceeds without empirical investigation; most empirical work proceeds without philosophical depth.

**Measurement innovation opportunities**: Philosophical theories could inform measurement innovation. If relational autonomy theories are right that autonomy requires social recognition and dialogical possibility (Westlund 2009), can these be operationalized and measured? If procedural autonomy theories emphasize authentic preference formation processes (Dworkin 1988), can we distinguish authentic from adaptive preferences empirically?

Conversely, empirical findings could inform philosophical theorizing. If workers report experiencing autonomy paradoxically—high in some dimensions, low in others (Wood et al. 2019)—should philosophical theories accommodate autonomy's multidimensionality rather than treating it as unitary?

**Cross-domain validation**: How could we know if a philosophical autonomy theory is empirically adequate? One approach: operationalize the theory's conditions, measure them in actual workplaces, test whether they predict outcomes the theory says autonomy enables (flourishing, moral responsibility, dignity). Few studies attempt such validation. This gap means philosophical theories remain largely untested empirically while empirical research lacks philosophical grounding.

## Gap 4: Worker Voice Missing from Conceptual Work

Perhaps most critically, worker voices are largely absent from conceptual work on autonomy. Philosophers theorize what autonomy requires without systematically investigating what workers experiencing algorithmic management identify as autonomy-relevant. Empirical researchers measure autonomy using predetermined scales without grounded theory exploration of how workers conceptualize autonomy, control, and agency.

**What workers know**: Workers under algorithmic management develop sophisticated practical knowledge about how systems operate, what autonomy means in their contexts, and how constraints affect agency. Sutherland and Jarrahi (2019) document "algorithmic competencies"—understanding developed through experience. Workers know where autonomy is threatened, how opacity affects decision-making, and what conditions enable versus undermine agency. This knowledge is epistemically valuable for conceptual work but remains largely untapped.

**Grounded concept development**: Grounded theory methodology (Charmaz 2014) provides frameworks for developing concepts systematically from participant perspectives. Applied to workplace autonomy: rather than importing philosophical theories and testing whether workers satisfy their conditions, we could investigate what workers identify as autonomy-relevant features of their work, what categories emerge from their accounts, and how these relate to existing theories.

Cant's (2019) workers' inquiry with Deliveroo riders and Irani and Silberman's (2013) Turkopticon research demonstrate value of centering worker perspectives. Workers identify algorithmic management features (arbitrary deactivation, opaque evaluation, pay manipulation) that undermine autonomy in ways philosophical theories might not anticipate. They also identify autonomy-supporting conditions (solidarity, information sharing, collective organizing) that individualistic theories might miss.

**Diverse worker experiences**: Workers are not homogeneous—experiences vary by platform, sector, occupation, race, gender, class, immigration status. Ticona and Mateescu's (2018) research on care platforms shows how algorithmic management affects marginalized workers differently. Conceptual work failing to engage diverse worker perspectives risks developing theories that don't capture how autonomy operates across social positions.

## Implications for Conceptual Revision

These gaps—philosophical theories developed without AI in mind, empirical research lacking conceptual depth, limited integration across domains, and missing worker voices—collectively make the case for empirically-informed conceptual revision.

**What revision could accomplish**:

1. **Update concepts for algorithmic contexts**: Develop autonomy concepts adequate to conditions philosophical theories didn't anticipate—opacity, continuous surveillance, personalized algorithmic treatment, indirect control through information and incentives.

2. **Integrate philosophical and empirical insights**: Combine philosophical sophistication about what autonomy requires with empirical evidence about how autonomy operates and what predicts flourishing in actual workplace contexts.

3. **Ground concepts in worker experiences**: Center worker voices in conceptual development, using grounded theory to identify what workers experiencing algorithmic management find autonomy-relevant.

4. **Enable better evaluation**: Develop concepts enabling clearer evaluation of algorithmic management systems—which features violate autonomy, which support it, how to design systems respecting worker agency.

5. **Inform practice and policy**: Create conceptual resources useful for workers, advocates, designers, and regulators—not just academic theory but practically relevant frameworks for understanding and improving workplace conditions.

**How interview-based research addresses gaps**: Systematic interviews with workers across different algorithmic management contexts could:

- **Identify novel autonomy dimensions**: What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant beyond traditional measures? Data control? Algorithmic transparency? Contestation rights? Solidarity opportunities?

- **Test philosophical theories empirically**: Do workers' experiences align with philosophical autonomy theories? Which theories best capture what workers identify as autonomy-undermining versus autonomy-supporting?

- **Develop grounded concepts**: What conceptual categories emerge from worker accounts? How do workers make sense of autonomy, control, and agency under algorithmic management?

- **Address diverse experiences**: How does algorithmic management affect autonomy differently for workers in different positions? What intersectional patterns emerge?

- **Inform ameliorative analysis**: What autonomy concept would best serve our purposes given what we learn about worker experiences and what predicts their flourishing?

This approach combines philosophical methods (conceptual analysis, normative argument) with empirical investigation (systematic interviews, grounded theory analysis) and normative purposes (developing concepts serving emancipatory aims). It takes seriously both philosophical sophistication and empirical grounding while centering worker perspectives often marginalized in academic research.

## From Gaps to Research Program

The gaps identified here are not deficiencies to criticize but opportunities for productive research. They reveal that we need conceptual work that is:

- **Empirically informed**: Grounded in how algorithmic management actually operates and affects workers
- **Philosophically sophisticated**: Maintaining conceptual clarity and normative depth
- **Worker-centered**: Taking seriously what workers experiencing these systems identify as important
- **Integrative**: Combining insights from philosophy, social science, and worker experience
- **Practically oriented**: Developing concepts useful for evaluation, critique, design, and policy

Such research would not abandon existing philosophical or empirical frameworks but build on their insights while addressing their limitations. The goal is not replacing existing concepts wholesale but refining and extending them to adequately address contemporary workplace realities.

## Summary of Key Findings

This review has synthesized philosophical, social scientific, and empirical literatures on autonomy and AI-mediated work, revealing both substantial knowledge and systematic gaps. Several key findings emerge:

**Autonomy's fundamental importance**: Across philosophical traditions from Kant (1785) to contemporary relational theorists (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000; Lee 2023), autonomy is recognized as essential for human dignity, moral responsibility, and flourishing. Social science provides robust empirical validation: workplace autonomy consistently predicts job satisfaction, engagement, mental health, and meaningful work (Humphrey et al. 2007; Van den Broeck et al. 2016; Allan et al. 2019). Workplace democracy advocates argue autonomy grounds not just political but economic self-governance (Dahl 1985; Anderson 2017). The normative and empirical cases for autonomy's importance are substantial and mutually reinforcing.

**Algorithmic management's scale and scope**: AI's workplace impacts are neither speculative nor marginal. Institutional data documents that 74% of U.S. firms and 42.3% of European workers now operate under algorithmic management (OECD 2025). This extends far beyond platform gig economy into traditional employment across sectors. The transformation is global, affecting developed and developing economies alike (ILO 2024). Algorithmic management represents mainstream workplace reality, not fringe phenomenon.

**Paradoxical autonomy effects**: Empirical research reveals autonomy impacts are not uniformly positive or negative but paradoxical and multidimensional. Platform workers report high scheduling autonomy but low task control (Wood et al. 2019). Algorithmic systems create flexibility in some dimensions while imposing constraint in others. Control operates indirectly through information provision, evaluation structures, and incentive design, not just direct commands (Kellogg et al. 2020). Workers develop "algorithmic competencies" to navigate systems (Sutherland and Jarrahi 2019) and organize collectively despite atomization (Cini 2023; Cant 2019), demonstrating persistent agency.

**Information asymmetry as systematic feature**: A consistent finding across platform work (Lee et al. 2015; Rosenblat 2018), crowdwork (Gray and Suri 2019), and traditional algorithmic management (Ajunwa 2020) is that workers lack information about how algorithms assign work, evaluate performance, set compensation, and make decisions affecting them. This opacity is not incidental but architected—platforms and employers benefit from information asymmetries enabling more efficient extraction and control. Yet autonomy theories across traditions assume agents can understand forces affecting them, creating conceptual mismatch.

**Critical political economy contexts**: Platform capitalism (Srnicek 2017) and surveillance capitalism (Zuboff 2019) frameworks situate algorithmic management within broader transformations of capital accumulation—data extraction, behavioral surplus, and prediction markets. Labor process theory (Gandini 2019; Delfanti 2021) connects contemporary algorithmic control to historical management strategies. These perspectives reveal autonomy as contested terrain shaped by power relations and economic imperatives, not just individual psychology or neutral technology.

**Persistent conceptual-empirical disconnect**: Despite sophisticated philosophical autonomy theories and robust empirical workplace autonomy research, systematic integration remains limited. Philosophical concepts (identification, authenticity, relational constitution) don't map cleanly onto empirical measures (scheduling autonomy, decision authority). Philosophical work rarely engages empirical findings about algorithmic management; empirical research rarely achieves philosophical depth about what autonomy requires and why it matters. Worker voices are largely absent from conceptual development.

## The Case for Conceptual Revision

These findings collectively support the case for empirically-informed conceptual revision. Existing autonomy frameworks—both philosophical and empirical—face systematic limitations when applied to AI-mediated work:

**Temporal lag**: Dominant theories were developed before algorithmic management existed, lacking conceptual resources for addressing opacity, continuous surveillance, personalized algorithmic treatment, and indirect control through information and incentives.

**Measurement gaps**: Standard empirical measures may miss autonomy dimensions specific to algorithmic work—data control, algorithmic transparency, contestation rights, protection from manipulation.

**Integration deficits**: Limited connection between philosophical sophistication and empirical grounding means theories risk irrelevance while empirical work lacks normative frameworks.

**Missing voices**: Worker perspectives—those experiencing algorithmic management daily and developing practical knowledge about its autonomy impacts—are largely absent from conceptual work.

Conceptual revision could address these limitations by developing autonomy concepts that are:
- **Adequate to contemporary conditions**: Capturing what's distinctive about algorithmic management
- **Empirically grounded**: Informed by how systems actually operate and affect workers
- **Philosophically sophisticated**: Maintaining conceptual clarity and normative depth
- **Worker-centered**: Incorporating what workers identify as autonomy-relevant
- **Practically useful**: Enabling evaluation, critique, design, and policy

## Path Forward: Empirically-Informed Autonomy Theory

The path forward requires methodological integration. Three research strands can be combined:

**Philosophical analysis** provides normative frameworks, conceptual clarity, and arguments for autonomy's importance. Ameliorative analysis (Haslanger 2012) licenses revising concepts to better serve our purposes. Relational autonomy theories (Westlund 2009; Friedman 2003) provide resources for understanding social dimensions. Meaningful work philosophy (Veltman 2016; Cholbi 2022) connects autonomy to flourishing.

**Empirical investigation** documents how algorithmic management operates and affects workers. Grounded theory methodology (Charmaz 2014) provides systematic procedures for developing concepts from qualitative data. Experimental philosophy (Knobe and Nichols 2008) offers methods for testing concepts empirically. Platform work research and HCI studies demonstrate valuable approaches to studying worker experiences.

**Worker perspectives** are essential—those navigating algorithmic management possess practical knowledge about what autonomy means in these contexts, what undermines it, and what supports it. Workers' inquiry methods (Cant 2019) and participatory design approaches (Salehi et al. 2015) suggest frameworks for centering worker voices.

Integration could proceed through systematic interview research with workers across different algorithmic management contexts, using grounded theory to develop conceptual frameworks while bringing philosophical resources to interpretation and normative evaluation. This would test whether existing autonomy theories adequately capture what workers identify as autonomy-relevant, generate new conceptual categories grounded in experience, and develop ameliorated concepts serving both philosophical sophistication and practical purposes.

## Concluding Reflection

AI's transformation of workplace autonomy raises stakes that are simultaneously theoretical and practical, individual and political, philosophical and empirical. If autonomy is essential for human dignity, moral responsibility, and flourishing—as philosophical and empirical research suggests—then understanding how algorithmic systems affect it becomes urgent. Yet without adequate concepts, we cannot clearly identify threats, evaluate interventions, or imagine alternatives.

This review has documented substantial knowledge about both autonomy and algorithmic management while revealing persistent gaps that conceptual revision could address. The challenge now is not just analyzing existing concepts or documenting empirical impacts in isolation, but integrating philosophical sophistication with empirical investigation while centering worker experiences. Such integration is methodologically demanding but appears necessary for developing conceptual resources adequate to contemporary workplace realities.

The goal is not academic theory for its own sake but practically relevant understanding that can inform worker advocacy, platform design, organizational practice, and public policy. Conceptual work, when empirically grounded and practically oriented, becomes not merely descriptive but potentially transformative—clarifying what's at stake, enabling better evaluation, and suggesting paths toward workplace technologies that respect rather than undermine human autonomy and dignity.
