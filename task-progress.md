[2025-11-13] Phase 5 Complete: Synthesis Writing and Assembly
  - **Section 1**: synthesis-section-1.md (463 words) - Introduction and Measurement Debates
    - Established methodological challenge: ratio vs. residual income (14pp difference)
    - Documented measurement heterogeneity across approaches (Stone, Li & Xu, Haffner & Hulse)
    - **H6 STRONGLY SUPPORTED**: Measurement operationalization is normatively charged
  - **Section 2**: synthesis-section-2.md (1,188 words) - Housing Burden Distribution
    - Income gradient: 38.2% burden for low-income vs. 16.2% for higher-income (European Parliament)
    - Urban costs: 70% rent increase 2011-2024 in A-cities (EmpiricaRegio)
    - Supply constraints: Need 320k units/year, falling short; Munich 0.2% vacancy
    - **H2 STRONGLY SUPPORTED**: High burdens for low-income urban dwellers
    - **H1 MIXED EVIDENCE**: Median burdens appear stable but may reflect spatial selection
  - **Section 3**: synthesis-section-3.md (1,357 words) - Labor Market Determinants
    - Wage stagnation: Hartz IV reduced wages ~4%, labor compensation 61%→55% GDP
    - Public sector: Wages kept pace 2009-2018 (24% vs. 25% economy-wide)
    - Dualization: Comprehensive theoretical framework (Palier & Thelen, Emmenegger et al.)
    - **H3 NOT SUPPORTED**: No evidence of public sector wage repression in aggregate
    - **H4 PLAUSIBLE BUT NOT QUANTIFIED**: Wage-burden link temporal but unquantified
    - **H5 STRONG THEORY, EMPIRICAL GAP**: Framework robust but lacks German quantification
  - **Section 4**: synthesis-section-4.md (607 words) - Research Gaps & Synthesis
    - Hypothesis assessments: H2, H6 strongly supported; H4, H5 plausible but unquantified; H3 not supported; H1 mixed
    - Critical gaps: decomposition analysis (H4), labor market status testing (H5), public-private comparison (H3), median-income longitudinal tracking (H1)
    - Synthesis: Income level is primary determinant; wage stagnation likely contributed; dualization provides framework; housing policy limited effectiveness
  - **Final Assembly**: literature-review-final.md
    - **Total word count**: ~3,615 words (body text, within 3000-4000 target)
    - **Papers cited**: 56 of 68 validated papers
    - **Bibliography**: Chicago Author-Date format with 56 entries
    - **Structure**: 4 sections with unified introduction and comprehensive references

- **literature-domain-[1-6].bib** - 68 validated BibTeX entries (ready for Zotero import)
- **validation-report.md** - Citation validation results (100% verification rate)

- **task-progress.md** - Complete progress tracker (this file)

## Key Findings Summary

**Strong Evidence**:
- **H6 (Measurement normatively charged)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED - 14pp difference between ratio and residual approaches
- **H2 (High low-income burdens)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED - Robust 20pp+ gradient across all studies

**Plausible but Unquantified**:
- **H4 (Wage explanation)**: Temporal coincidence strong, but no decomposition study quantifying 80%+ proportion
- **H5 (Dualization explains burden)**: Comprehensive theoretical framework, but lacks German empirical quantification

**Not Supported**:
- **H3 (Public sector wage repression)**: Public wages kept pace 2009-2018; no aggregate repression

**Mixed Evidence**:
- **H1 (Flat median burdens)**: Apparent stability may reflect spatial selection (migration, displacement) rather than true stability

**Critical Research Gaps**:
1. Decomposition analysis: What % of burden variation from wage vs. rent vs. composition changes?
2. Labor market status testing: Does insider/outsider status predict burden controlling for income?
3. Public-private comparison: Housing burdens by sector at same income levels?
4. Median-income longitudinal: Track same households over time within cities?

## Statistics

- **Total papers found**: 68 (6 domains)
- **Verification rate**: 100% (68/68 verified)

- **Final word count**: 3,615 words (body text)
- **Completion time**: Single session (Phase 5: ~2 hours)
- **Quality**: Focused, insight-driven review emphasizing empirical findings and research gaps

## Next Steps (Optional)

- Import BibTeX files to Zotero for citation management
- Use synthesis sections as basis for specific research proposal sections
- Address identified research gaps in future empirical work
- Revise individual sections if needed (all section files preserved)
