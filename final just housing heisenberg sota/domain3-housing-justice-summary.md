## Major Positions on BOTH Sides

### Anti-Gentrification / Pro-Incumbent Protection

**Key Arguments**:
- **Autonomy-based**: Displacement violates located life plans and place-based autonomy (Huber & Wolkenstein, van Leeuwen)
- **Community goods**: Joint labor creates collective value deserving protection (Lloyd)
- **Non-material harms**: Phenomenological displacement, loss of belonging (Lopez-Cantero)
- **Democratic**: Gentrification undermines everyday democratic communication (Draper)
- **Structural**: Class dispossession and capitalist accumulation (Harvey, Madden & Marcuse)

**Scholars**: Huber, Wolkenstein, Lloyd, Lopez-Cantero, van Leeuwen, Draper, Slater, Harvey, Madden, Marcuse

**Strengths**:
- Captures temporal dimension: established residents develop attachments, projects, relationships over time
- Recognizes non-material values (community, belonging, democratic culture)
- Identifies collective/structural harms beyond individual welfare
- Grounds claims in autonomy, not just welfare, elevating normative status

**Challenges**:
- May protect segregation and exclusion (tension with Anderson)
- Difficulty distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate displacement
- Unclear why incumbents' claims trump newcomers' equal access claims
- Can entrench privilege under guise of place-protection

### Pro-Development / Market-Oriented

**Key Arguments**:
- **Liberty-based**: Newcomers have liberty claims to build and access (Christmas)
- **Aggregate benefits**: Gentrification brings revitalization, economic growth, reduced poverty (though displaced people disappear from statistics)
- **Supply constraints**: Housing crisis caused by restrictive zoning, NIMBYism (Kogelmann, Christmas)
- **Integration**: Breaking segregation requires neighborhood change (Anderson)
- **Property rights**: Secure property rights necessary to solve homelessness (Essert)

**Scholars**: Christmas, Essert, Anderson (on integration), Kogelmann (critical analysis)

**Strengths**:
- Addresses supply-side constraints and artificial scarcity
- Challenges incumbent veto over newcomer access
- Integration argument has strong racial justice foundation
- Highlights newcomers' claims often ignored in displacement debates

**Challenges**:
- Aggregate benefits often accrue to different people than costs
- Ignores non-material harms and community dissolution
- May facilitate gentrification under guise of housing access
- Underestimates place-attachment's moral significance

### Middle Ground / Alternative Frameworks

**Right to Housing Advocates**:
- Housing as basic right or capability regardless of market (Wells, Dummer & Neuhäuser, Desmond, Madden & Marcuse)
- State obligation to ensure housing access
- Neither incumbent nor newcomer claims settle issue - all have housing rights
- Focus on provision, not just distribution of existing stock

**Structural Injustice Theorists**:
- Focus on systemic patterns, not individual rights/wrongs (Young, Shelby)
- Housing injustice reflects basic structure failures
- Collective responsibility to remedy structural patterns
- Integration and desegregation as structural imperatives (Anderson)

**Capability Approach**:
- Housing quality relative to others matters for self-respect and capabilities (Dummer & Neuhäuser)
- Positional goods require distributional principles beyond sufficiency
- Links housing to fundamental conditions for equal citizenship

**Limitarianism**:
- Upper bounds on housing wealth complement lower bounds (Erck)
- Excessive ownership wrongful when others lack enough
- Addresses concentration and hoarding, not just provision

## Gaps and Connections to Other Domains

### Notable Gaps

1. **Temporal Structure Under-Theorized**: Most work focuses on synchronic distribution or current rights, not diachronic entitlement evolution. How do housing claims strengthen/weaken over time? When does residence create occupancy rights?

2. **Climate Migration**: Minimal philosophical work connecting climate displacement to housing justice. How do climate refugee claims interact with incumbent housing claims in climate-safe cities?

3. **Exclusionary Zoning Ethics**: Kogelmann begins this, but limited sustained philosophical analysis of zoning's moral status. When is exclusion wrongful vs. legitimate community self-determination?

4. **Comparative Justice**: Most work examines single-city justice. What about justice across cities/regions? Can place-protection in one city create injustice elsewhere?

5. **Integration vs. Place-Protection Tension**: Anderson and Huber/Wolkenstein point opposite directions. How to balance desegregation imperatives with incumbent protection?

### Connections to Other Domains

**Domain 1 (Temporal Claims & Distributive Justice)**:
- **Core connection**: Housing incumbency provides paradigm case of temporal priority claims
- Occupancy rights arguments ground entitlements in historical presence/attachment
- Tensions between temporal priority and equal access
- **Key question**: Do temporal claims from prior residence trump equal access rights?

**Domain 2 (Climate Justice & Migration)**:
- **Connection**: Climate migration will intensify housing competition in climate-safe cities
- Rising housing costs may exclude climate refugees from safe regions
- Incumbent vs. newcomer tension amplified when newcomers are climate refugees
- **Key question**: Do climate refugees' displacement claims override incumbents' place-attachment claims?

**Potential Domain 4 (Time-Slice vs. Historical Principles)**:
- Housing justice literatures implicitly takes historical view - current holdings reflect past injustice (segregation, discrimination, redlining)
- Connects to Nozick's entitlement theory and rectification of past injustice
- **Key question**: Does housing's history of injustice require more than time-slice redistribution?

**Cross-Cutting Themes**:
- **Commodification**: When is market allocation inappropriate for housing as basic need?
- **Structural injustice**: How do institutional patterns create systemic housing injustice?
- **Non-material values**: Community, belonging, democratic culture vs. material welfare
- **Temporal priority**: Does established residence create stronger claims than equal access?

## Synthesis Recommendations

1. **Frame Around Incumbent-Newcomer Tension**: This is the CENTRAL conflict connecting to temporal claims project. Housing provides concrete case study where temporal priority (incumbents) conflicts with equal access (newcomers).

2. **Distinguish Levels of Analysis**:
   - Individual rights (Wells, Essert, Huber & Wolkenstein)
   - Community goods (Lloyd, Draper)
   - Structural patterns (Young, Shelby, Anderson)

3. **Map Normative Framework Variations**:
   - Rights-based (Wells, Harvey)
   - Capability approach (Dummer & Neuhäuser)
   - Freedom/autonomy (Essert, Wells, Huber & Wolkenstein)
   - Structural injustice (Young, Shelby)
   - Political economy (Harvey, Madden & Marcuse, Aalbers)
   - Show how different frameworks generate different conclusions

4. **Integration-Protection Tradeoff is CRUCIAL**:
   - Anderson: integration requires neighborhood change, may override place-attachment
   - Huber & Wolkenstein: occupancy rights protect incumbents from displacement
   - **This tension is UNRESOLVED and central to housing justice**

5. **Empirical Grounding Essential**:
   - Desmond's eviction research
   - Lees/Slater/Wyly's gentrification documentation
   - Shelby's segregation analysis
   - Don't let philosophy float free from empirical reality

6. **Recent Work (2020-2025) Shows Field Maturation**:
   - Multiple papers in top philosophy journals
   - Sophisticated normative frameworks beyond simple welfare or rights
   - Growing attention to non-material harms, structural patterns, capabilities
   - Field moving from niche to mainstream philosophical concern

7. **Political Economy Critical But Contested**:
   - Left scholars (Harvey, Madden & Marcuse, Aalbers) see housing crisis as structural feature of capitalism
   - Others work within capitalist frameworks seeking reforms
   - **Fundamental disagreement**: Can housing justice be achieved through market reforms, or does it require decommodification?

## Key Takeaways for Research Project

1. **Housing provides IDEAL case study for temporal claims research**: Incumbency grounds claims in historical presence, attachment formation, community creation - all temporal processes

2. **The autonomy-based framework dominates but faces challenges**: Van Leeuwen's critique shows limits; Kogelmann reveals internal tensions; needs refinement

3. **Material vs. non-material harms**: Housing justice includes welfare but also belonging, community, democratic culture, self-respect - richer normative landscape

4. **Structural vs. individual analysis**: Young and Shelby show limits of individual-responsibility models; housing injustice is systemic

5. **Unresolved tension: protection vs. access**: Place-protection arguments may entrench privilege/segregation; access arguments may facilitate displacement. No clear resolution.

6. **Climate connection under-explored**: Housing justice literature doesn't adequately address climate migration implications. This is a GAP the research project could address.

7. **Philosophical work grounded in empirical reality**: Desmond, Lees/Slater/Wyly, Anderson provide essential empirical foundations. Philosophy can't proceed in empirical vacuum.

8. **Multiple normative frameworks available**: Rights, capabilities, freedom, structural injustice, political economy each illuminate different dimensions. Synthesis requires acknowledging pluralism.
