## Key Papers and Main Arguments

### Foundational Distributive Justice Works

**1. Rawls - A Theory of Justice (1971) [HIGH]**
Develops justice as fairness with the difference principle and primary goods framework. All-purpose means (rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth) should be distributed to benefit the least advantaged. However, treats goods as fungible and location-neutral, struggling to accommodate spatially-embedded goods where location fundamentally affects value.

**2. Walzer - Spheres of Justice (1983) [HIGH]**
Rejects single universal justice principle in favor of "complex equality" where different social goods are distributed according to different principles appropriate to their social meanings. Argues against "dominance" where success in one sphere converts to success in others. Offers pluralist alternative directly relevant to housing as a distinct sphere with its own distributive logic.

**3. Dworkin - What is Equality? Part 2 (1981) [HIGH]**
Develops equality of resources using the envy test and desert island auction. Distinguishes option luck from brute luck. Influential resourcist approach but assumes goods are fungible and tradeable—housing and location create complications since spatial scarcity means not everyone can occupy desirable locations even with equal budgets.

**4. Young - Justice and the Politics of Difference (1990) [HIGH]**
Critiques reduction of justice to distributive justice, arguing this ignores processes, decision-making structures, and culture. Identifies five faces of oppression (exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, violence) that cannot be reduced to distribution. Foundational for non-distributive dimensions of spatial justice—who decides land use, whose cultures are recognized.

**5. Anderson - What is the Point of Equality? (1999) [HIGH]**
Critiques luck egalitarianism for focusing on non-relational goods rather than social relations. Argues egalitarian justice should create communities where people relate as equals, eliminating oppression rather than equalizing brute luck. Relational egalitarianism offers alternative framework where housing justice concerns social relations in communities, not just resource distribution.

### Capabilities Approaches

**6. Sen - Development as Freedom (1999) [HIGH]**
Argues justice requires capability equality, not welfare or resource equality—what people can actually do with resources given conversion factors. Widely applied to spatial justice: same income yields different capabilities in different neighborhoods (access to jobs, schools, safety). Provides framework for understanding how place affects functionings.

**7. Nussbaum - Creating Capabilities (2011) [HIGH]**
Develops specific list of ten central human capabilities required for human dignity, including "control over one's environment." However, critics argue her list inadequately captures housing-specific concerns and lacks relational elements important for positional goods. Provides framework for housing as basic entitlement but may need supplementation.

**8. Basta - From Justice in Planning toward Planning for Justice (2016) [MEDIUM]**
Applies capabilities approach to urban planning, developing concept of "spatial primary goods" as spatial analogue to Rawls's primary goods. Argues spatial goods cannot be reduced to general primary goods—require specific analysis of how place shapes capabilities. Important bridge between distributive justice and planning practice.

### Positional Goods and Allocation Mechanisms

**9. Hirsch - Social Limits to Growth (1976) [HIGH]**
Introduces "positional goods" whose value depends on relative position in distribution—elite education, scenic views, desirable neighborhoods. Unlike material goods, positional goods face absolute scarcity; if everyone has them, no one benefits. Foundational for understanding housing as positional good with distinctive justice challenges.

**10. Elster - Local Justice (1992) [HIGH]**
Analyzes principles and procedures institutions actually use to allocate scarce goods (college admissions, organ transplants, military conscription). Distinguishes "local justice" (context-specific allocation) from "global justice" (society-wide distribution). Directly relevant to housing allocation mechanisms—lottery, queue, need, merit, market, historical occupancy each have different justice implications.

### Spatial Justice Theory

**11. Soja - Seeking Spatial Justice (2010) [HIGH]**
Argues justice has a geography and spatial distribution is a basic human right. Develops "spatial justice" as distinct from social justice, focusing on locational discrimination through urban planning, zoning, redlining. Uses Los Angeles case studies to demonstrate spatial injustice. Foundational for establishing spatial justice as distinct field, though philosophical foundations for specifically spatial principles remain underdeveloped.

**12. Harvey - Social Justice and the City (1973) [HIGH]**
Marxist analysis of how capitalism produces unjust urban space through uneven development and commodification of land and housing. Later develops "right to the city"—collective right to reshape urban space according to human needs not profit. Argues housing justice requires examining property relations and capital flows, not just allocation principles. Critical geography foundational text.

**13. Fainstein - The Just City (2010) [MEDIUM]**
Develops urban justice theory based on three principles: equity (fair distribution), diversity (social/economic mixing), and democracy (meaningful participation). Synthesizes Rawls, Young, Sen, Harvey for urban context. Influential urban planning application bridging philosophy and practice, though pragmatic balancing may lack principled basis for resolving principle conflicts.

**14. Moroni - The Just City (2020) [MEDIUM]**
Argues spatial justice is derivative from general justice principles, not autonomous domain. Emphasizes institutions (property rights, zoning laws, governance) as primary subject of justice, not just spatial distributions. Methodological intervention challenging Soja's autonomy claim, redirecting focus from outcomes to rules. Important conceptual clarification though may understate how spatiality creates distinctive justice issues.

### Recent Work on Housing and Spatial Justice

**15. Shelby - Dark Ghettos (2016) [HIGH]**
Analyzes racially segregated, economically disadvantaged neighborhoods as symptoms of systemic injustice violating Rawlsian principles of reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, and civic equality. Segregation per se is morally neutral; injustice is concentrated disadvantage. Sophisticated philosophical analysis directly relevant to displacement and gentrification questions.

**16. Dawkins - Just Housing (2021) [HIGH]**
Develops housing justice conception combining distributive justice (reduce extreme poverty), recognition justice (respect diverse preferences), and procedural justice (inclusive decision-making). Recognizes housing's distinctive features (connection to identity, community, self-determination) requiring tailored framework. Recent philosophical treatment specifically of housing justice, directly relevant to policy.

**17. Dummer - Housing Justice, Basic Capabilities, and Self-Respect (2025) [HIGH]**
Very recent paper arguing Nussbaum's capabilities approach fails to capture housing justice fundamentals because it lacks relational elements. Housing has positional good elements—inequality matters even above minimum thresholds because housing connects to social bases of self-respect. Develops hybrid framework combining capability threshold with Rawlsian self-respect concern. Excellent example of cutting-edge housing justice philosophy.

**18. Israel & Frenkel - Social Justice and Spatial Inequality (2018) [MEDIUM]**
Develops framework for assessing spatial justice combining Sen's capabilities with Bourdieu's capital forms. Location in social space and living environment jointly influence capabilities—same resources yield different capabilities in different places. Important bridge between philosophical theory and empirical spatial inequality analysis, providing operationalized assessment framework.

**19. Stilz - Territorial Sovereignty (2019) [MEDIUM]**
Develops Kantian theory of territorial rights based on occupancy (stable land use), basic justice (effective law), and self-determination (collective governance). Provides philosophical foundation for occupancy rights and claims against displacement. Relevant to temporal dimension of housing claims—long-term occupancy creates justice-relevant interests even without ownership.

### Recognition and Market Limits

**20. Fraser - From Redistribution to Recognition? (1995) [MEDIUM]**
Argues contemporary justice requires both redistribution (economic justice) and recognition (cultural justice). Proposes "participatory parity"—justice requires social arrangements permitting all to participate as peers. Later adds representation (political voice) as third dimension. Widely applied to spatial justice—housing involves both who gets resources and whose neighborhoods are valued.

**21. Satz - Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale (2010) [MEDIUM]**
Analyzes when markets are "noxious" using four parameters: vulnerability, weak agency, harmful individual outcomes, harmful social outcomes. Some goods' social meanings matter morally. Relevant to housing commodification debates—housing markets may score problematically on vulnerability and social harms, suggesting pure market allocation may be noxious.

**22. Cohen - Rescuing Justice and Equality (2008) [MEDIUM]**
Defends luck egalitarianism against Rawls—justice fundamentally concerns eliminating brute luck inequalities, not merely improving worst-off position. Relevant to housing justice debates about whether spatial inequality from circumstances (birthplace) is unjust requiring correction. However, faces challenges with non-fungible located goods where equal resources don't eliminate positional inequality.

### Recent Systematic Review

**23. Rot et al. - Is It Just Planning? (2025) [LOW]**
Systematic review of justice in spatial planning literature identifying distributive, procedural, and recognitional dimensions. Notes planning literature needs more conceptual precision about justice frameworks. Recent confirmation of gap between philosophical precision and planning application, supporting multidimensional approach to housing justice.

## Major Theoretical Positions Identified

### 1. Rawlsian Resourcism (4 papers)
**Core claim:** Justice concerns fair distribution of primary goods (all-purpose means) according to principles like the difference principle.
**Key figures:** Rawls, Dworkin
**Strength:** Systematic framework with clear principles
**Limitation:** Treats goods as fungible, struggles with spatially-embedded and positional goods
**Relevance:** Dominant framework but needs modification for housing

### 2. Capabilities Approach (5 papers)
**Core claim:** Justice requires capability equality—what people can actually do and be, not just resources they have.
**Key figures:** Sen, Nussbaum, Basta, Israel & Frenkel, Dawkins
**Strength:** Captures how place affects conversion of resources to functionings
**Limitation:** Sen resists specifying capabilities; Nussbaum's list may miss housing-specific and relational concerns
**Relevance:** Widely applied to spatial justice, operationalizable for housing policy

### 3. Relational Egalitarianism (3 papers)
**Core claim:** Justice is about social relations of equality, not distributive patterns; oppression not inequality is the fundamental wrong.
**Key figures:** Anderson, Young, Scheffler
**Strength:** Captures non-distributive dimensions like status, recognition, power relations
**Limitation:** Harder to operationalize; needs specification for which inequalities undermine equal standing
**Relevance:** Offers framework for segregation, community, and recognition beyond allocation

### 4. Pluralist/Spheres (2 papers)
**Core claim:** Different goods should be distributed according to different principles appropriate to their social meanings; oppose dominance across spheres.
**Key figures:** Walzer
**Strength:** Recognizes that housing may require distinctive principles, not one-size-fits-all
**Limitation:** How to determine sphere-specific principles? Risk of conservative particularism
**Relevance:** Supports treating housing as special good with own logic

### 5. Spatial Justice Theory (6 papers)
**Core claim:** Justice has a geography; spatial arrangements themselves produce and reproduce injustice requiring geography-first analysis.
**Key figures:** Soja, Harvey, Moroni, Fainstein, Shelby
**Spectrum:** From Harvey's radical critique to Moroni's derivative view
**Strength:** Centers spatiality, attends to locational discrimination and urban political economy
**Limitation:** Philosophical foundations underdeveloped; unclear if spatial justice is derivative or autonomous
**Relevance:** Directly addresses housing and urban inequality

### 6. Critical Urban Theory (2 papers)
**Core claim:** Urban spatial injustice stems from capitalist property relations, commodification, and systemic structures requiring transformative politics.
**Key figures:** Harvey, Shelby
**Strength:** Analyzes structural causes, not just distributive symptoms
**Limitation:** May not yield specific principles for allocation under current conditions
**Relevance:** Challenges whether distributive approaches can address housing justice within capitalism

## Notable Gaps and Connections to Other Domains

### Identified Gaps:

1. **Limited theorization of non-fungibility:** Few papers explicitly analyze what non-fungibility means for distributive principles beyond noting that location matters. Need more systematic account of how non-fungible goods affect equality principles, allocation mechanisms, and justice requirements.

2. **Positional goods theory underdeveloped for housing:** Hirsch (1976) introduced positional goods but application to housing justice remains limited. Dummer (2025) begins addressing this but more work needed on distributive implications of positional scarcity, especially regarding equality above thresholds.

3. **Temporal dimensions under-theorized:** Historical injustice, displacement, gentrification, and temporal priority claims receive limited treatment in mainstream distributive justice. Stilz (2019) addresses occupancy but more needed on how time establishes claims, intergenerational justice in housing, and path dependency of spatial inequality.

4. **Allocation mechanisms for spatial goods:** Elster (1992) analyzes allocation principles but limited work on specifically spatial allocation (lotteries, queues, markets, planning, historical occupancy). How should scarce desirable locations be allocated? Which principles are appropriate for which contexts?

5. **Analytic-critical geography bridge:** Limited dialogue between analytic political philosophy (Rawls, Sen, Anderson) and critical geography (Harvey, Soja). These traditions talk past each other despite addressing similar issues. More integrative work needed.

6. **Operationalization gap:** Gap between philosophical precision and planning/policy application. Israel & Frenkel (2018) and Basta (2016) bridge this but more needed on translating abstract principles to measurable spatial justice indicators and policy guidance.

### Connections to Other Domains:

**Domain 2 (Temporal Aspects):**
- Stilz's occupancy interests ground temporal claims
- Elster's allocation mechanisms include temporal priority (queues, first-come)
- Shelby on systemic injustice connects to historical segregation
- Need theories of temporal justice in housing allocation

**Domain 3 (Housing-Specific):**
- Dawkins, Dummer, Basta provide housing-specific frameworks
- Satz on market limits relevant to housing commodification
- Capabilities approach widely applied to housing
- Housing as positional and special good

**Domain 4 (Rights and Legitimate Expectations):**
- Stilz on occupancy rights
- Rawls and Walzer on basic structure and entitlements
- Fraser on participatory parity as right
- Need connection between distributive justice and housing rights

**Domain 5 (Community and Relational Goods):**
- Young, Anderson, Scheffler on relational dimensions
- Walzer on community meanings
- Fraser on recognition
- Harvey on right to the city and collective claims

## Conclusion

This domain search successfully identified 22 high-quality papers spanning foundational distributive justice theory, capabilities approaches, relational egalitarianism, spatial justice theory, and recent housing-specific work. The literature reveals increasing recognition (especially 2010-2025) that spatially-embedded goods pose distinctive challenges for distributive justice requiring either modification of standard frameworks (capabilities, spatial primary goods) or alternative approaches (spheres, relational, spatial justice).

Key tensions remain unresolved: Is spatial justice derivative or autonomous? Can distributive frameworks accommodate non-fungible goods? What principles should govern allocation of positional spatial goods? How do temporal claims fit into distributive frameworks? These gaps create space for original contribution in the housing justice and temporal claims project.

The search provides strong foundation for state-of-the-art review with comprehensive coverage of major positions, verified citations, and clear connections to project themes. Ready for synthesis phase.
