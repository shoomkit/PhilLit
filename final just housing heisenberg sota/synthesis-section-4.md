## Section 4: Occupancy Rights and Place-Based Temporal Claims

### Stilz's Occupancy Theory

Stilz's (2009, 2013, 2019) occupancy theory provides the most systematic philosophical framework for understanding how temporal residence generates moral claims to place. Her account grounds territorial rights in three core values: occupancy (stable possession of geographical space needed for central life projects), basic justice (effective legal institutions), and collective self-determination (capacity for self-governance). The occupancy interest is foundational: people develop "located life plans"—projects, relationships, and commitments intertwined with specific places that cannot simply be relocated without fundamental disruption to agency and identity.

Occupancy rights, as Stilz theorizes them, differ critically from both property rights and mere possession. Unlike property, occupancy rights are not transferable—they attach to persons through their use and residence, not through market exchange. Unlike mere possession, which can be revoked at will, occupancy rights create legitimate expectations of stability and immunity from arbitrary removal. These rights establish through temporal residence: as people invest in place-specific projects, form non-transferable relationships, and build lives around particular spatial configurations, they acquire moral claims to remain that strengthen over time.

Crucially for housing justice debates, Stilz (2019) argues that occupancy rights can arise even after unjust dispossession. Present occupancy creates genuine moral claims despite a neighborhood's potentially unjust origins through redlining, urban renewal, or discriminatory policies. This independence from historical title helps address path dependency: current residents in neighborhoods shaped by past injustice have legitimate occupancy claims even though the spatial configuration itself resulted from wrongdoing. However, this independence does not eliminate rectificatory duties to those historically displaced—it creates a complex scenario where multiple parties have legitimate but conflicting claims.

Stilz's (2013) analysis of removal's wrongfulness establishes that displacement from one's place of occupancy constitutes a distinctive harm. Removal severs connections constitutive of identity and agency, disrupts the ability to be author of one's life commitments, and destroys investments in place-specific projects. Even with full compensation for material losses, displacement wrongs occupants because money cannot restore the particular relationships, community ties, and spatial familiarity that ground autonomous agency. This non-fungible character of place-based attachment explains why gentrification harms cannot be fully remedied through compensation or equivalent housing elsewhere—the value destroyed is location-specific.

### Territorial Rights Theory and Self-Determination

Moore's (2015) political self-determination theory extends occupancy thinking to collective territorial rights. Peoples—understood as groups of persons residing in territory and planning lives around relationship to it—have territorial rights through legitimate occupancy plus collective self-determination interests. Her framework identifies three foundations: individual moral rights of residency (each person's claim to stable residence), collective moral rights of occupancy (group claims emerging from shared residence), and peoples' rights to self-determination (capacity to make collective decisions about shared territorial life). Time matters fundamentally: longer occupancy strengthens both individual and collective claims by deepening attachment, thickening social relationships, and establishing institutional frameworks for self-governance.

Moore's account requires balancing past wrongs against present occupancy claims. Historical territorial injustices create obligations, but these must be weighed against current occupants' legitimate claims established through residence and self-determination. Applied to neighborhoods as sub-state territories, this framework suggests that residential communities constitute "peoples" with collective self-determination interests. Long-term residents have both individual residency rights (claims to stable housing in their neighborhood) and collective occupancy rights (shared claims to neighborhood character, governance, and future trajectory). Gentrification threatens territorial self-determination by disrupting the community's capacity to collectively determine its future, even when individual residents are not physically displaced.

Nine's (2012, 2022, 2025) alternative "river model" challenges assumptions of exclusive bounded territories. Her foundational territories concept envisions transnational, overlapping political units designed to manage shared resource systems that transcend traditional boundaries. Territory emerges from interdependence in managing watersheds, urban infrastructure, and overlapping economic systems. Neighborhoods exemplify foundational territories: residents share infrastructure, public spaces, and resource systems requiring collective management through nested and overlapping jurisdictions rather than exclusive control. This challenges winner-take-all displacement logic—perhaps neighborhoods can accommodate overlapping claims from established residents, newcomers, and broader city/regional populations, each with legitimate but partial territorial authority over different decision domains.

Miller's (2012) nationalist account grounds territorial rights in long-term occupancy and cultural integration with landscape. National communities develop claims through shaping territory across generations—building infrastructure, creating cultural landscapes, establishing institutions. While Miller focuses on nations, the logic potentially extends to neighborhood-level cultural communities that have similarly shaped local spaces over decades. This raises questions about which collectivities count as rights-bearing "peoples" for territorial purposes: nations certainly, but also cities, neighborhoods, ethnic enclaves, cultural communities?

### Urban Applications: Gentrification and Displacement Ethics

Huber and Wolkenstein's (2018) pioneering application of occupancy theory to gentrification establishes that displacement violates occupancy rights even for renters without property ownership. The "located life plans" concept captures how human projects depend on spatial stability: children's schools, employment proximity, social networks, religious communities, cultural institutions, and informal relationships all require geographic continuity. Gentrification-driven displacement disrupts these simultaneously, creating a compound harm distinct from simple distributive injustice. Even if displaced residents find equivalent housing by objective measures (same square footage, similar neighborhood income levels), they suffer irreplaceable loss of place-specific connections. The wrong persists even with compensation because the value destroyed—embeddedness in particular social and spatial networks—is non-fungible.

Krishnamurthy and Moore's (2024) recent work provides the most comprehensive philosophical account of gentrification's wrongfulness through a pluralistic framework. They identify three types of place-based rights that gentrification violates: rights to a home (secure shelter and private space for core life activities), rights of residency (stable political membership and participation in local governance), and place-based rights to community (valued social relationships tied to specific neighborhoods). Each right has temporal dimensions. Home rights require duration—temporary shelter cannot provide the stability needed for life planning. Residency rights strengthen over time through participation in local institutions and democratic processes. Community rights deepen as relationships thicken and collective practices become established across years or decades.

Their framework addresses standard objections effectively. First, occupancy rights don't depend on property ownership—renters develop all three types of place-based claims through residence. Second, the harms are not purely distributive—even if displaced residents receive compensation maintaining their economic position, they lose relational and participatory goods that money cannot replace. Third, occupancy rights don't require community homogeneity—diverse neighborhoods generate place-based rights just as culturally unified ones do, as residents develop attachments to the particular character of their community including its diversity. The pluralistic structure recognizes that gentrification wrongs along multiple dimensions simultaneously, explaining why simple policy responses (compensation, equivalent housing elsewhere) prove inadequate.

### Critical Challenges and Theoretical Limits

Van Leeuwen's (2025) critical examination exposes challenges for autonomy-based displacement accounts. If occupancy rights ground claims through autonomous life planning, what distinguishes wrongful displacement (gentrification) from legitimate relocation (moving for career opportunities, family reunification, personal choice)? Both disrupt located life plans, yet we treat them differently. The autonomy framework risks either over-generating objections (any relocation becomes problematic) or under-specifying when displacement specifically wrongs. Van Leeuwen pushes occupancy theorists to provide more precise criteria for legitimate versus illegitimate displacement, distinguishing voluntary from involuntary moves, and identifying which life plans merit protection through occupancy rights.

Operationalization challenges persist. When exactly does occupancy begin generating rights? Wells (2019) proposes minimum three years for lease-like security, but is this sufficient for deep attachment that Stilz and others emphasize, or too long for mobile populations? How much place-based investment is required—must one participate in local institutions, or does mere residence suffice? Can occupancy rights be forfeited through extended absence, and if so, how long? These questions require answers for occupancy theory to guide policy, yet philosophical work has not fully developed the criteria.

Newcomer exclusion presents perhaps the deepest tension. Strong occupancy rights protecting established residents risk entrenching segregation and exclusion. Anderson's (2010) integration imperative argues that residential segregation fundamentally perpetuates racial inequality across all life dimensions—education, employment, wealth accumulation, health, political power. Achieving integration may require overriding incumbent preferences and disrupting established communities. Kogelmann (2025) demonstrates that autonomy arguments cut both ways: anti-gentrification advocates cite displacement's autonomy violations, while pro-zoning advocates cite homeowners' autonomy to control their property and neighborhood. The same normative principle yields opposed policy conclusions, suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate the incumbent-newcomer tension.

Scale questions remain under-theorized. Do occupancy principles apply differently at individual household level versus community level? Nine's overlapping territories model suggests multiple scales of legitimate claims—individuals, neighborhoods, cities, regions—each with partial authority over different decision domains. But which scales should determine which housing decisions? If neighborhood occupancy rights ground anti-displacement claims, do they also ground exclusionary zoning authority? Or does the broader city/regional scale have legitimate interest in ensuring housing access that overrides neighborhood preferences?

Occupancy theory provides powerful conceptual resources for understanding why temporal duration matters morally—it proxies for depth of place-based life projects meriting protection. Displacement harms are real, substantial, and inadequately addressed through compensation alone. Yet reconciling incumbent protection with newcomer access, integration imperatives, and future housing needs remains the fundamental challenge. Occupancy theory establishes that one dimension of justice (protecting established attachments) but does not resolve how to weigh this against competing dimensions (enabling access, promoting integration, serving future needs). The economic realities of agglomeration and spatial lock-in, to which we now turn, make these tradeoffs unavoidable and urgent.
