DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Urban economics examines why economic activity clusters in cities and how housing markets mediate access to location-specific opportunities. The field has established that agglomeration economies—productivity gains from geographic concentration—drive urban growth through sharing mechanisms (labor pooling, input sharing), matching (specialized labor markets), and learning (knowledge spillovers). Recent empirical work has quantified how housing supply constraints, driven by both geographic factors and land use regulation, prevent workers from accessing high-productivity cities, reducing aggregate economic growth. This creates path-dependent development patterns where early infrastructure investments and regulatory choices lock in spatial configurations that persist across generations.

The literature reveals three interconnected mechanisms that make housing a non-fungible, location-specific good. First, agglomeration effects create substantial wage premiums in high-productivity cities (10-30% higher wages for equivalent workers). Second, housing supply inelasticity—caused by geographic constraints (mountains, oceans) and regulatory barriers (zoning, permitting delays)—means these productivity differences translate into housing price differences rather than population mobility. Third, this creates spatial lock-in where high housing costs prevent low-skill workers from accessing opportunity-rich locations, while infrastructure investments (highways, transit) create path dependencies that shape urban form for decades. Recent work shows these constraints reduced US GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009, with profound distributional consequences.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
These economic findings provide the empirical foundation for philosophical debates about housing justice and temporal claims. The literature demonstrates that location is not fungible—places differ fundamentally in economic opportunity due to agglomeration effects that cannot be replicated elsewhere. Housing supply constraints create a direct mechanism by which past decisions (zoning laws enacted decades ago, infrastructure investments) restrict current generations' access to opportunities. The quantified magnitudes (36% GDP loss, 18% population decline from highways, regional income convergence halted after 1980) establish that these are not marginal effects but constitute major sources of injustice. This empirical basis is essential for normative arguments that current residents cannot claim exclusive rights to location-specific value they did not create.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The past decade has seen important empirical advances. First, better identification strategies (instrumental variables using planned highway routes, geographic constraints) have established causal effects of regulation on housing supply. Second, the "spatial misallocation" literature has quantified aggregate losses from housing constraints in high-productivity cities. Third, new data on gentrification and displacement has nuanced earlier claims, showing that original residents in gentrifying neighborhoods often benefit from remaining, though displacement remains a concern for renters. Fourth, the homogenization of housing regulations across previously high-elasticity sunbelt cities suggests the "suburban frontier is closing," potentially worsening affordability nationwide.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While the literature extensively documents agglomeration effects and supply constraints, several gaps remain relevant to normative analysis. First, limited work examines how much of urban land value derives from public vs. private investment (infrastructure, schools, amenities vs. private development). Second, the literature focuses on metropolitan-level effects but provides less guidance on neighborhood-scale justice questions (gentrification, displacement). Third, temporal dynamics receive less attention—most models are static equilibria rather than examining how past decisions constrain current choices. Fourth, normative questions about who should benefit from agglomeration economies and how to distribute gains remain largely outside economics' scope, creating space for philosophical contribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For the literature review, prioritize Hsieh & Moretti (2019) as the headline finding on aggregate costs of housing constraints. Use Combes & Gobillon (2015) and Moretti (2011) for comprehensive coverage of agglomeration mechanisms. Gyourko & Molloy (2015) and Saiz (2010) are essential for understanding supply constraints. Ganong & Shoag (2017) and Autor et al. (2013) show spatial mismatch and regional divergence. Fischel (2001) and Baum-Snow (2007) demonstrate path dependency and lock-in. For gentrification, Ellen & O'Regan (2011) and Dragan et al. (2020) provide nuanced evidence. The synthesis should emphasize how these findings collectively establish that location-specific value is real, substantial, and unequally accessible due to constraints rooted in past decisions.

Documents large local multiplier effects—each high-tech job creates 5 additional local service jobs—and shows low-skilled workers benefit substantially from proximity to high-skilled workers. RELEVANCE: Establishes that agglomeration benefits flow broadly, not just to high-skilled workers, with important distributional implications. The multiplier effects demonstrate that excluding workers from productive cities has cascading negative effects.

Each high-tech job creates three additional local service jobs through multiplier effects. The Great Divergence between successful and struggling cities has accelerated since 1980, creating winner-take-all geography. Location matters more than ever despite globalization and internet. RELEVANCE: Accessible synthesis demonstrating to broader audience that spatial inequalities are growing, not shrinking, despite technologies that theoretically enable remote work. The winner-take-all geography raises justice concerns about unequal access to opportunity based on birthplace. The documented acceleration post-1980 suggests current generation faces more constrained geographic mobility than previous generations, relevant to intergenerational justice arguments about housing.

Dense cities facilitate face-to-face contact that drives knowledge spillovers and innovation. Urban residents are greener (smaller carbon footprints) and have better economic mobility than suburban/rural residents. Main urban problems (high housing costs, poverty concentration) stem from misguided policies, especially restrictive zoning and land use regulations, not inherent urban features. RELEVANCE: Influential synthesis establishing that cities' high housing costs reflect success and productivity, not failure, but that supply restrictions prevent people from accessing urban opportunities. Frames housing affordability as policy failure rather than market failure, suggesting regulatory reform could expand access. The emphasis on cities as opportunity engines supports normative arguments that exclusionary housing policies create injustice by preventing access to these opportunities.

  doi = {10.1257/jel.47.4.983},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Empirical research on cities requires considering population, income, and housing prices simultaneously in spatial equilibrium framework. Housing supply elasticity determines whether urban success manifests as population growth (elastic supply) or income/price growth (inelastic supply). Manufacturing clustering to reduce goods transport costs no longer drives urbanization; modern cities depend on density's role in speeding idea flows and enabling face-to-face contact. Urban poverty reflects cities attracting poor people seeking opportunity, not cities making people poor. RELEVANCE: Establishes spatial equilibrium framework showing how housing supply constraints convert productivity gains into housing price increases rather than expanded opportunity access. This framework is essential for understanding how exclusionary zoning transforms the benefits of agglomeration (which could be shared through population growth) into private gains for existing homeowners (through price appreciation). The theoretical apparatus supports normative arguments about distributive justice in urban contexts.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops comprehensive index (WRLURI) measuring residential land use regulation across 2,000+ US jurisdictions based on survey of local officials. Documents substantial variation in regulatory stringency, with strong positive correlations across regulation types. Highly regulated communities have multiple approval entities, density controls, impact fees, and 6+ month permitting delays. Regulation is not random—correlates with coastal location, high home prices, slow historical growth, and educated populations, suggesting endogenous political economy. RELEVANCE: Provides empirical measure enabling research on regulatory effects on housing supply, prices, and access. The documentation of regulation's geographic concentration in high-opportunity coastal cities directly supports arguments about exclusionary housing policies limiting access to productive locations. The correlations with education and home prices suggest homevoter hypothesis—existing residents use regulation to protect property values, raising normative questions about whose interests local land use policy should serve.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Uses satellite data on terrain and water bodies to precisely measure developable land in US metro areas. Geographic constraints (steep slopes >15 degrees, oceans, wetlands) strongly predict housing supply inelasticity—places with less developable land have much less elastic housing supply. Most inelastic markets (San Francisco, Miami, New York) are severely land-constrained by geography. Even controlling for regulation, geographic constraints independently reduce supply elasticity, though regulation matters too and may be partly endogenous to geography. RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing supply constraints are partly exogenous (geographic) not purely policy choices, complicating normative analysis. Some cities' high costs partly reflect genuine scarcity, not just exclusionary regulation. However, interaction between geography and regulation suggests path dependency—constrained cities adopt stricter regulation, amplifying constraints. This dual causation (geography + regulation) is important for housing justice debates about whether and how to expand access to opportunity-rich but supply-constrained locations.

  doi = {10.1257/jep.32.1.3},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Housing supply elasticity determines whether increased demand raises prices or quantities. In inelastic markets (coastal cities), demand shocks cause large price increases; in elastic markets (sunbelt), same shocks cause building booms. During 1980s boom, most inelastic metros saw 29% price growth vs. 3.4% in most elastic. Supply elasticity helps determine whether productivity growth creates bigger cities or just higher-paid workers and expensive homes. Aggregate implications are substantial: if all metros were as elastic as median, US housing stock would be 15 million units larger. RELEVANCE: Establishes quantitative magnitudes of supply constraint effects on housing affordability and economic geography. The finding that elasticity differences lead to 29% vs. 3.4% price growth for same demand shock demonstrates how profoundly regulation shapes who can access productive cities. The counterfactual (15 million more units if not for constraints) quantifies the scale of exclusion, directly relevant to housing justice arguments about whether current residents' preferences should determine access to opportunity-rich locations.

Uses spatial equilibrium model with 220 metro areas to show that constraints preventing workers from accessing productive locations reduced US GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009. Mechanism: high-productivity cities adopted stringent zoning/regulations limiting housing supply, which raised housing costs and prevented in-migration of workers who would be more productive there. Lowering constraints in NYC, San Francisco, San Jose to median would increase GDP by 8.9%. RELEVANCE: The headline empirical finding for housing justice debates: supply constraints in productive cities reduced US GDP by over one-third across 45 years. This quantifies aggregate costs of exclusionary policies and establishes that these are first-order effects on national welfare, not just local distributional concerns. The finding that removing constraints in just three cities would raise GDP 9% demonstrates extraordinary concentration of opportunity and cost of exclusion, powerfully supporting arguments against exclusionary local control.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Rising Chinese import competition between 1990-2007 caused higher unemployment, lower labor force participation, and reduced wages in US local labor markets (commuting zones) housing import-competing manufacturing industries. Uses cross-market variation in exposure based on initial industry specialization. Import competition explains one-quarter of aggregate US manufacturing employment decline. Transfer benefits (unemployment, disability, retirement, healthcare) rise sharply in trade-exposed areas, indicating adjustment costs are large and persistent. RELEVANCE: Demonstrates spatial lock-in—workers in declining manufacturing regions face substantial barriers to moving to growing regions, contrary to standard assumptions of frictionless mobility. The large persistent effects (visible in transfer payments) show that labor is not easily reallocated across space. Combined with Ganong & Shoag findings on housing costs preventing mobility, suggests workers in declining regions are trapped between disappearing opportunities and inaccessible growing regions, with profound justice implications for geographic inequality.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: US states experienced steady income convergence from 1880-1980 (1.8% per year) as workers migrated from low-wage to high-wage states. This convergence stopped after 1980. Mechanism: land-use restrictions in high-income states raised housing costs, creating barriers to entry for less-skilled workers. Migration from low-wage to high-wage states drove 40-75% of century-long convergence. After 1980, high housing costs make migration no longer worthwhile for low-income workers—attorneys can still afford to move (housing 21% of income) but janitors cannot (rent 52% of income). RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing costs now prevent low-income workers from accessing high-wage regions, a fundamental change from historical pattern. This is direct evidence that exclusionary housing policies create spatial injustice by blocking economic mobility for those who need it most. The asymmetry (high-skilled can still move, low-skilled cannot) shows how housing constraints exacerbate inequality. The historical comparison demonstrates this is recent phenomenon, not inevitable, suggesting policy reforms could restore convergence.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Housing supply elasticity significantly affects local labor market responses to labor demand shocks. Locations with fewer construction barriers experience more residential building and smaller house price increases when housing demand rises. For equal labor demand shocks, highly regulated places see 17% smaller housing stock expansion and nearly double the house price increase. Employment response to labor demand is less than 0.8% in supply-constrained places compared to 1% in unconstrained places, meaning constraints reduce employment growth by 20%+. RELEVANCE: Establishes that housing constraints don't just affect housing markets—they directly limit local employment growth and economic opportunity. A city experiencing job growth cannot accommodate new workers if housing supply cannot expand, meaning opportunity goes unrealized. This links housing policy directly to economic access and opportunity, showing that exclusionary housing policies don't just raise costs but actively prevent job creation and reduce economic dynamism, with efficiency and equity implications.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Uses data on wages and housing costs to infer land rents, local productivity, and total value of local amenities across US metropolitan areas, accounting for federal taxes and locally-produced nontraded goods. Finds that wage and housing cost differences are explained more by productivity than quality-of-life differences. Most productive and valuable cities are typically coastal, sunny, mild, educated, and large. The approach reveals large differences in land rents—estimated at over 2x GDP nationally. RELEVANCE: Establishes that urban land values primarily reflect productivity differences (agglomeration economies) rather than just amenity differences. This matters normatively because productivity-based land values arguably should be shared more broadly (they reflect positive externalities, public investments) while amenity-based values might reflect legitimate preferences. The finding that land rents exceed 2x GDP quantifies the enormous value at stake in debates about urban land use and access, suggesting potential for substantial revenue from land value taxation.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops first comprehensive transaction-based index of land values for all US metropolitan areas using novel estimation methods incorporating urban economic theory as Bayesian prior. Land values at city center increase with city size, as do land-value gradients; both are highly variable across cities. Total urban land values estimated at more than 2x GDP in 2006. Five major agglomerations (NY, LA, SF, DC, Boston) account for 48% of all US urban land value despite being much smaller share of population or GDP. RELEVANCE: Quantifies extreme concentration of land value in handful of metro areas, directly relevant to spatial justice concerns. Finding that 5 regions hold nearly half of all urban land value demonstrates winner-take-all geography with profound distributional implications. The size-land value relationship supports agglomeration theory: bigger cities generate disproportionate value. This concentration raises normative questions about whether such value should be captured locally or shared nationally, especially when access is limited by exclusionary policies.

  number = {26142},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Documents large increase in geographic sorting by skill across cities and neighborhoods over past four decades. Develops spatial model showing that as rich get richer, their increased demand for downtown luxury amenities drives housing prices up in central cities. A 10% increase in metro income associated with 13% increase in affluent households living downtown. Rising incomes of rich explain roughly half of urbanization of rich (top income decile) and suburbanization of poor (bottom decile). Poor residents either displaced or pay higher rents for amenities they value less. RELEVANCE: Establishes that income inequality manifests spatially through neighborhood sorting, with high-income households bidding up prices in amenity-rich downtown areas. This spatial sorting has distributional consequences—poor households are made worse off through displacement or higher rents. The finding that income growth drives spatial sorting suggests that addressing housing justice requires addressing income inequality and preferences for spatial exclusivity.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether economic gains in low-income neighborhoods during 1990s followed classic gentrification pattern (high-income in-migration, low-income displacement). Using confidential Census data tracking individuals, finds no evidence of heightened displacement of original residents, even most vulnerable. Income gains came from three sources: entrance of higher-income homeowners, selective exit of lower-income homeowners, and income gains by original residents. Original residents reported greater improvements in neighborhood satisfaction than those in other low-income neighborhoods. RELEVANCE: Nuances common gentrification narratives by showing original residents often benefit from neighborhood improvement without being displaced, at least for homeowners. However, study period (1990s) and focus on homeowners limits generalizability to current rental-heavy gentrification. Importantly for housing justice debates, suggests neighborhood change is not zero-sum—original residents can benefit alongside newcomers. But methodology cannot assess whether benefits were fairly distributed or whether more egalitarian improvements were possible. POSITION: Empirical analysis finding limited displacement of original homeowners during 1990s neighborhood improvement.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Uses longitudinal NYC Medicaid records tracking low-income children from 2009-2015 to examine displacement during rapid gentrification. Finds no evidence that gentrification meaningfully changes mobility rates over 7 years, though associated with slightly longer-distance moves. Children starting in gentrifying areas experience larger improvements in residential environment (lower poverty rates, better schools) than counterparts in persistently low-SES areas. Gentrification appears to benefit rather than harm most low-income children in sample. RELEVANCE: Most rigorous recent evidence on displacement question using individual-level longitudinal data. Findings challenge simple displacement narratives but study focuses on very low-income families (Medicaid-eligible) who may face different dynamics than working-class renters. The environmental improvements for stayers raise complex normative questions—should we resist gentrification to preserve affordable access, or encourage it because residents benefit from improvements? The lack of displacement may reflect NYC rent regulations not present elsewhere. POSITION: Empirical analysis finding limited displacement but environmental improvements for low-income children in gentrifying neighborhoods.},

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {2001},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory that homeowners dominate local government because home values serve as report card for local policies. Unlike corporate stockholders who diversify, homeowners have most wealth in single illiquid asset, making them intensely interested in local governance. Homeowners "vote their homes," supporting policies that raise property values and opposing those that lower them. This explains fragmented metropolitan governance, restrictive zoning, suburban sprawl, and resistance to affordable housing—all serve to protect and enhance home values for existing owners. RELEVANCE: Provides political economy foundation for understanding exclusionary housing policies as rational homeowner behavior rather than mere prejudice or inefficiency. If correct, suggests that local control over land use inevitably produces exclusion when homeowners dominate, raising fundamental questions about appropriate level of government for housing decisions. The theory implies that expanding housing affordability requires overriding homeowner preferences—either through higher-level government intervention or changing incentive structure (e.g., land value taxation). Essential for normative debates about local control. POSITION: Political economy theory explaining exclusionary housing policies as result of homeowner incentives to protect property values.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether Interstate Highway System caused central city population decline between 1950-1990. Uses planned highway routes from 1947 plan as exogenous variation. Finds each new highway ray passing through central city reduced its population by approximately 18%. Aggregate central city population declined 17% despite 72% metropolitan area growth. Highways enabled suburbanization by reducing commuting costs, allowing workers to live farther from jobs while maintaining access to urban labor markets. Effect is causal, not just correlation. RELEVANCE: Demonstrates path dependency and spatial lock-in—infrastructure investments from 1950s-70s created suburban development patterns that persist today. The 18% population decline per highway ray shows how single infrastructure decisions have enormous long-term spatial consequences. Once highways enabled suburban development, reversal is nearly impossible (can't un-build highways, suburban investment is sunk). This historical example illustrates how past decisions constrain present options, directly relevant to temporal justice arguments about inherited spatial configurations limiting current generation's choices. POSITION: Empirical evidence for path dependency and lasting spatial effects of infrastructure investments (highways causing suburbanization).},
