## Key Papers and Main Arguments

### Core Theoretical Frameworks

**1. Anna Stilz - "Why Do States Have Territorial Rights?" (2009)**
- Foundational article establishing occupancy theory of territorial rights
- Argues state jurisdictional rights are grounded in legitimate institutions that protect individuals' stable possession of geographical space

**10. Meena Krishnamurthy & Margaret Moore - "What Makes Gentrification Wrong? A Place-based Account" (2024)**
- Pluralistic account identifying three violated place-related rights: rights to home, rights of residency, rights to community
- Gentrification wrongs residents by disrupting multiple forms of place attachment simultaneously
- Directly applies territorial rights frameworks to urban housing context
- Shows temporal residence matters by building multiple forms of attachment deserving moral protection

### Alternative Approaches

**11. Ryan Pevnick - Immigration and the Constraints of Justice (2011)**
- "Associative ownership" theory grounding territorial rights in citizens' contributions to political institutions
- Quasi-property rights for those who built/maintained institutions
- Contribution-based rather than occupancy-based account
- Could justify longtime residents' claims as proxy for institutional contribution

**12. Lea Ypi - "A Permissive Theory of Territorial Rights" (2014)**
- Cosmopolitan corrective: territorial rights provisional and conditional, not absolute
- States have territorial rights only if committed to establishing global political authority
- Kantian framework emphasizing both domestic and cosmopolitan justice

**13. Avery Kolers - Land, Conflict, and Justice (2009)**
- "Ethnogeographic community" as right-holding group (not nation or state)
- Emphasizes material interaction with land and ecological stewardship
- Pioneering environmental approach demanding ecological sustainability

### Phenomenological Foundations

**15. Jeff Malpas - Place and Experience (2018, 2nd ed)**
- Phenomenological account: human being is inextricably bound to place
- Place is methodologically and ontologically fundamental (not reducible to space or time)

**16. Edward Casey - The Fate of Place (1997)**
- Comprehensive philosophical history from pre-Socratics to twentieth century
- Central theme: increasing neglect of place in favor of abstract space
- Traces phenomenological recovery of place in twentieth century (Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Bachelard, Heidegger)
- Foundational text establishing place as philosophical topic
- Shows philosophical resources for taking place seriously beyond property/economic frameworks

### Cosmopolitanism vs. Localism

**17. Seyla Benhabib - Another Cosmopolitanism (2006)**
- Tension between universal human rights and bounded democratic sovereignty
- Extends Kant's universal hospitality to long-term stays
- Advocates porous borders; critiques territorial exclusion
- Cosmopolitan challenge to territorial rights theories emphasizing boundedness
- Frames fundamental question: can territorial attachments justify exclusion?

**18. Hagar Kotef - Movement and the Ordering of Freedom (2015)**
- Critical genealogy of mobility-stability tension in liberal political thought
- Shows how liberal tradition simultaneously celebrates mobility as freedom and restricts it along exclusionary lines
- Exposes political construction of mobility/stability distinction
- Relevant to housing debates: economic mobility (moving for opportunities) vs. right to stability (remaining in place)

## Major Theoretical Positions Identified

### 1. **Occupancy/Self-Determination Theories** (6 papers)
- **Key scholars:** Stilz, Moore
- **Core claim:** Territorial rights arise from stable possession of place needed for life projects and collective self-determination
- **Strength:** Connects individual autonomy interests to territorial claims; applies at multiple scales
- **Application:** Directly applicable to gentrification—longtime residents have occupancy rights against displacement

### 2. **Nationalist Theories** (2 papers)
- **Key scholars:** Miller, Meisels
- **Core claim:** Cultural nations develop territorial rights through long-term inhabitation and cultural integration with homeland
- **Strength:** Emphasizes collective identity and cultural meaning of place
- **Application:** Could ground neighborhood communities' claims based on shared culture/history

### 3. **Place-Based/River Model Theories** (3 papers)
- **Key scholars:** Nine, Ochoa Espejo
- **Core claim:** Territorial rights grounded in ecological features, resource interdependence, relational networks
- **Strength:** Moves beyond ownership to relationality; accommodates overlapping authorities
- **Application:** Urban contexts where neighborhoods are interdependent through infrastructure and social networks

### 4. **Gentrification Applications** (4 papers)
- **Key scholars:** Huber & Wolkenstein, Krishnamurthy & Moore
- **Core claim:** Occupancy rights and place-based rights apply at neighborhood level; gentrification violates these rights
- **Strength:** Direct application of territorial rights theory to housing justice
- **Application:** Provides philosophical framework for "right to stay put" in gentrifying neighborhoods

### 5. **Contribution-Based Theories** (1 paper)
- **Key scholar:** Pevnick
- **Core claim:** Territorial rights arise from contributions to political institutions
- **Strength:** Grounds claims in reciprocity and fairness
- **Application:** Temporal duration matters as proxy for institutional contribution

### 6. **Cosmopolitan Critiques** (2 papers)
- **Key scholars:** Benhabib, Ypi
- **Core claim:** Territorial rights must be provisional, limited by universal justice requirements
- **Strength:** Prevents absolute territorial claims; emphasizes mobility rights
- **Application:** Challenges neighborhood exclusion; supports housing mobility programs

## Connections to Housing/Neighborhood Contexts

### Direct Applications:
1. **Gentrification literature** (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024) shows occupancy rights extend to neighborhoods, not just states
2. **Climate displacement work** (Stilz 2024) demonstrates place-based life projects create moral claims to remain
3. **Foundational territories** (Nine 2025) shows territorial authority can exist at urban/neighborhood scales

### Bridging to Housing Justice:
- **Occupancy theory:** If people develop place-based life projects deserving protection, temporal residence duration becomes morally significant
- **Self-determination:** Neighborhood communities may have self-determination claims supporting resident control over development
- **Place phenomenology:** Malpas and Casey show place is fundamental to human existence, grounding strong anti-displacement claims
- **River model:** Urban interdependence suggests territorial rights arise from relationships and responsibilities, not ownership

### Key Tensions:
1. **State vs. sub-state:** Most theory focuses on states; application to neighborhoods underdeveloped
2. **Mobility vs. stability:** Cosmopolitans emphasize freedom of movement; territorialists emphasize right to remain
3. **Exclusion vs. openness:** Territorial claims can justify exclusion (problematic for housing access); but also justify protection against displacement
4. **Property vs. occupancy:** Territorial rights distinct from property rights, but relationship unclear in housing contexts

## Implications for Housing Justice and Temporal Claims

1. **Temporal duration matters:** Multiple theories suggest longer residence strengthens territorial claims through:
   - Formation of place-based life projects (Stilz)
   - Development of self-determination capacity (Moore)
   - Contributions to institutions (Pevnick)
   - Material interaction with place (Kolers)
   - Multiple forms of attachment (Krishnamurthy & Moore)

2. **Rights beyond property:** Occupancy rights protect residents' place-based autonomy even without property ownership—crucial for renters facing displacement

3. **Neighborhood-level claims:** Recent work shows territorial rights theory applies to neighborhoods, not just states or nations

4. **Anti-displacement foundations:** Phenomenological and occupancy accounts provide strong philosophical grounding for "right to stay put"

5. **Tensions remain:** Cosmopolitan critiques raise questions about whether territorial attachments can justify exclusion of newcomers

6. **Policy-relevant:** Framework distinguishes jurisdictional rights (who governs), resource rights (who benefits), and border control (who can enter)—each potentially applicable to housing policy at different scales

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

1. **Operationalization:** How to measure/apply concepts like "occupancy," "attachment," "place-based life projects" in policy contexts
2. **Temporal thresholds:** How long must residence last to generate territorial claims? Literature unclear.
3. **Competing claims:** How to adjudicate between longtime residents' claims to stay and newcomers' claims to access?
4. **Scale questions:** What is appropriate scale for territorial authority in housing—building, block, neighborhood, city?
5. **Phenomenology-normative bridge:** Little work integrates phenomenological insights (Malpas, Casey) with normative political theory
6. **Intersectionality:** How do territorial claims interact with race, class, gender in housing contexts?
