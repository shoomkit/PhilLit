# Literature Review Plan: Located Goods and Dynamic Justice

## Research Idea Summary

This project develops a temporal theory of housing justice centered on **located goods** - goods whose value and allocation are inseparable from their spatial position. Unlike standard distributive frameworks that treat housing as fungible, this project argues that housing claims are irreducibly about *place* (access to specific locations) and *time* (past occupancy, current residence, future opportunity). The central challenge is adjudicating between temporally structured claims to finite, non-reproducible locations - most visible in gentrification conflicts between incumbents' claims to remain and newcomers' claims to access. By integrating philosophical analysis with urban economics insights on path dependency, agglomeration effects, and spatial lock-in, this project aims to provide normative foundations for housing policy that acknowledge both place-specificity and dynamic justice claims.

## Key Research Questions

1. What makes housing a "located good" and how does this differ from fungible goods in distributive justice theory?
2. How should we adjudicate between competing temporal claims (incumbent vs. newcomer) to specific locations?
3. What role do past occupancy, current residence, and future opportunity play in grounding housing justice claims?
4. How do economic phenomena like agglomeration effects and spatial lock-in shape the moral landscape of housing allocation?
5. Can a temporal theory of housing justice resolve tensions between stability (protection from displacement) and mobility (access to opportunity)?
6. What are the implications for housing policy, gentrification, and urban development?

## Coverage Rationale

These six domains provide comprehensive coverage of the theoretical and empirical landscape needed for developing a temporal theory of housing justice:

**Theoretical foundations** are established through Domains 1 (distributive justice frameworks), 2 (temporal justice), and 6 (property theory). These provide the core normative concepts: what makes goods located vs. fungible, how temporal claims work, and how occupancy grounds property-like claims.

**Applied context** comes from Domain 3 (housing justice and gentrification), which examines the concrete debates and conflicts the theory must address - particularly the incumbent vs. newcomer tension in gentrifying neighborhoods.

**Political philosophy** of place is covered in Domain 4 (territorial rights and place attachment), providing resources for understanding the normative significance of place-based connections and the mobility-stability trade-off.

**Empirical grounding** is provided by Domain 5 (urban economics), which explains the mechanisms that make housing a located good - agglomeration effects, path dependency, and spatial lock-in - and shows how these create the distributional challenges the normative theory must address.

The domains are structured to build from general theoretical frameworks (1, 2, 6) through political philosophy of place (4) to applied contexts (3), with economic insights (5) informing the entire project. Each domain contributes essential concepts while maintaining clear boundaries to avoid duplication.

## Expected Gaps

Based on this domain structure, the research project is positioned to fill several gaps:

1. **Integration gap**: Existing work treats housing justice, distributive justice, and temporal justice largely separately. This project integrates all three with economic insights about location.

2. **Theoretical gap**: While there is extensive applied work on gentrification, there is limited foundational theory on what makes housing a distinctive kind of good that resists standard distributive frameworks.

3. **Temporal gap**: Most housing justice work is synchronic (who deserves what housing now), but this project develops diachronic principles (how claims evolve over time with occupancy and use).

4. **Adjudication gap**: The literature acknowledges tensions between incumbent and newcomer claims but lacks systematic principles for adjudicating between them. The temporal theory aims to provide such principles.

5. **Integration of economics and philosophy**: Most philosophical work on housing justice lacks engagement with urban economics on agglomeration and path dependency; most economic work lacks normative frameworks. This project bridges them.

## Estimated Scope

- **Total domains**: 6
- **Estimated papers**: 106-127 papers total (targeting ~120)
  - Domain 1: 18-22 papers
  - Domain 2: 18-22 papers
  - Domain 3: 22-25 papers
  - Domain 4: 15-18 papers
  - Domain 5: 18-22 papers
  - Domain 6: 15-18 papers

- **Key positions/debates to cover**:
  - Egalitarian vs. libertarian vs. sufficientarian distributive frameworks
  - Cosmopolitan vs. communitarian views on territorial rights
  - Historical/backward-looking vs. forward-looking justice principles
  - Pro-gentrification (urban renewal) vs. anti-gentrification (anti-displacement) positions
  - Property as labor-based vs. occupancy-based vs. conventional
  - Mobility rights vs. stability rights priorities

- **Time frame**:
  - **Foundational/classic works**: Include seminal works regardless of date (Rawls, Walzer, Locke on property, etc.)
  - **Contemporary emphasis**: Strong focus on last 10-15 years (2010-2025), especially for:
    - Domain 2 (temporal justice - emerging field, significant developments since 2010)
    - Domain 3 (housing justice - rapidly evolving with gentrification debates, housing crisis discourse)
    - Domain 5 (urban economics - empirical findings on agglomeration, housing supply, path dependency)
  - **Recent developments**: Use WebSearch extensively to capture 2015-2025 publications, including cutting-edge work from 2023-2025

## Search Priorities

1. **Foundational theoretical works** - Establish core concepts and frameworks first (Domains 1, 2, 6). These anchor the entire review.

2. **Recent empirical and applied work** - Capture current state of housing justice debates and urban economics findings (Domains 3, 5). These show what problems the theory must solve.

3. **Bridging literature** - Identify work that crosses domain boundaries:
   - Philosophy + economics on spatial justice
   - Property theory + housing justice
   - Temporal justice + gentrification
   - Territorial rights + urban contexts

4. **Critical responses and objections** - For each major theoretical position, find critical responses and alternatives. This is especially important in Domain 3 (gentrification debates are polarized).

5. **Interdisciplinary connections** - Given the interdisciplinary nature of this project, prioritize work that bridges philosophy, economics, urban studies, and policy.

## Domain Interactions and Overlaps

**Expected overlaps** (researchers should coordinate to avoid duplication):

- **Domains 1 & 4**: Spatial justice and territorial rights both address place-based claims
  - Resolution: Domain 1 focuses on distributive frameworks generally; Domain 4 focuses specifically on territory and place attachment

- **Domains 2 & 6**: Both address occupancy and temporal claims
  - Resolution: Domain 2 focuses on justice over time broadly; Domain 6 focuses specifically on property rights from occupancy

- **Domains 3 & 4**: Housing justice and place attachment both engage incumbent claims
  - Resolution: Domain 3 focuses on applied housing debates; Domain 4 provides theoretical resources about place

- **Domains 3 & 5**: Both address gentrification
  - Resolution: Domain 3 focuses on normative analysis; Domain 5 focuses on economic mechanisms

**Key connections to synthesize**:

1. **Domains 1 + 2 → 3**: General distributive and temporal frameworks applied to housing justice
2. **Domains 4 + 6 → 3**: Place attachment and property theory ground incumbent claims in housing debates
3. **Domain 5 → All**: Economic insights about agglomeration and path dependency inform normative theorizing across all domains
4. **Domains 2 + 6**: Temporal justice + occupancy theory = foundations for temporal housing claims
5. **Domains 1 + 5**: Distributive justice + spatial lock-in = understanding constraints on just allocation

## Notes for Domain Researchers

**General guidance**:

1. **Use WebSearch extensively**: This is a contemporary topic with recent developments. After identifying foundational works, use WebSearch to find 2023-2025 publications in each domain.

2. **Interdisciplinary sources**: Don't limit searches to philosophy journals. This project requires engagement with urban studies, economics, legal theory, and geography.

3. **Key journals to monitor across domains**:
   - Philosophy: *Philosophy & Public Affairs*, *Journal of Political Philosophy*, *Ethics*, *Political Theory*
   - Applied: *Journal of Applied Philosophy*, *Public Affairs Quarterly*, *Social Theory and Practice*
   - Interdisciplinary: *Politics, Philosophy & Economics*, *Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy*
   - Urban: *Urban Studies*, *Housing Studies*, *International Journal of Urban and Regional Research*
   - Economics: *Journal of Urban Economics*, *Regional Science and Urban Economics*

4. **Look for synthesis opportunities**: Flag papers that bridge multiple domains - these will be especially valuable.

5. **Capture the debate structure**: For contested topics (especially gentrification in Domain 3), ensure you capture major positions on different sides, not just one perspective.

6. **Note empirical claims**: When papers make empirical claims about housing, urban dynamics, or spatial patterns, note these - they may need verification from Domain 5 economics literature.

7. **Track key concepts across domains**: Terms like "path dependency", "occupancy", "displacement", "agglomeration" may appear in multiple domains with different meanings - note these variations.

8. **Geographic scope**: While much housing justice literature focuses on US contexts, seek international perspectives, especially from Europe (different housing tenure systems) and Global South (informal settlements, different property regimes).

9. **Coordination points**:
   - If you find a paper that clearly belongs in another domain, flag it for that researcher
   - Note gaps you observe - areas where you expected to find literature but didn't
   - Highlight particularly influential works that other domains should be aware of

10. **Quality over quantity**: Aim for the estimated paper counts, but prioritize high-quality, influential works. One seminal paper is worth more than three marginal ones.

**Specific domain notes**:

- **Domain 1 researchers**: Look for any discussion of how spatiality challenges standard distributive frameworks, even if not explicitly about housing
- **Domain 2 researchers**: This is an emerging area - you may need to piece together temporal justice from work on historical injustice, intergenerational justice, and path dependency
- **Domain 3 researchers**: Expect large, contested literature - be systematic in capturing different positions
- **Domain 4 researchers**: Bridge carefully between high-level territorial rights theory and neighborhood/housing applications
- **Domain 5 researchers**: Focus on economic mechanisms most relevant to normative questions - not all urban economics is relevant
- **Domain 6 researchers**: Connect property theory abstractions to concrete housing contexts - look for applied work on renters' rights, adverse possession in housing

**Citation management**:

- Record full citations with abstracts
- Note key arguments/claims from each paper (1-2 sentences)
- Flag papers as: "essential", "important", or "useful"
- Indicate which specific research questions from your domain the paper addresses
- Note connections to other domains
