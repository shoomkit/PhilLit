**Date:** 2025-11-14
**Papers Found:** 22 (High: 12, Medium: 8, Low: 2)
**Output File:** `domain5-urban-economics.bib`

## Executive Summary

This literature search identified 22 key papers establishing the economic foundations for understanding housing as a "located good" with non-fungible, place-specific value. The research demonstrates three interconnected mechanisms: (1) **agglomeration economies** create substantial productivity gains from geographic concentration, (2) **housing supply constraints** (geographic and regulatory) prevent workers from accessing high-productivity locations, and (3) **path-dependent development** locks in spatial configurations based on past infrastructure and regulatory decisions. The headline finding: housing supply constraints in productive US cities reduced GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009 (Hsieh & Moretti 2019).

## Key Papers and Main Arguments

### Foundational Agglomeration Theory

**Duranton & Puga (2004) - "Micro-Foundations of Urban Agglomeration Economies"**
- Establishes three theoretical mechanisms explaining why firms and workers cluster in cities despite higher costs: **sharing** (indivisible facilities, risk pooling), **matching** (better quality matches, faster matching), and **learning** (knowledge spillovers)
- Shows that geographic concentration creates productivity gains that cannot be replicated in dispersed locations
- Provides theoretical foundation for why location is economically non-fungible

**Rosenthal & Strange (2004) - "Evidence on the Nature and Sources of Agglomeration Economies"**
- Comprehensive empirical review finding doubling city size increases productivity by 3-8%
- Documents that agglomeration effects decay rapidly with distance (within 1-5 miles, not regions)
- Effect magnitudes are substantial and highly localized, demonstrating that specific neighborhoods/cities generate unique value

**Combes & Gobillon (2015) - "The Empirics of Agglomeration Economies"**
- Most rigorous modern synthesis addressing identification challenges (worker/firm sorting)
- After controlling for selection, doubling city population increases wages by 2-5%, with larger effects for high-skilled workers
- Establishes that agglomeration effects are causal, not just artifacts of productive workers sorting to cities

**Moretti (2011) - "Local Labor Markets"** [ESSENTIAL]
- Develops general equilibrium framework showing productivity differences manifest in either higher wages OR higher housing costs depending on housing supply elasticity
- Documents large local multiplier effects: each high-tech job creates 5 additional local service jobs
- Shows low-skilled workers benefit substantially from proximity to high-skilled workers (3-5x more than high-skilled benefit)
- **Key insight:** Housing supply constraints convert opportunity into affordability crises

### Housing Supply Constraints and Regulation

**Gyourko, Saiz & Summers (2008) - "Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index (WRLURI)"**
- Develops comprehensive measure of regulatory stringency across 2,000+ US jurisdictions
- Documents substantial variation and correlation with coastal location, high prices, educated populations
- Enables empirical research linking regulation to housing outcomes and economic access

**Saiz (2010) - "The Geographic Determinants of Housing Supply"** [ESSENTIAL]
- Uses satellite data to measure developable land, finding geographic constraints (mountains, oceans, slopes >15°) strongly predict supply inelasticity
- Most inelastic markets (San Francisco, Miami, NYC) are severely land-constrained by geography
- **Normative implication:** Some cities' high costs reflect genuine scarcity, not just exclusionary regulation, complicating justice analysis

**Gyourko & Molloy (2015) - "Regulation and Housing Supply"**
- Comprehensive handbook review establishing regulation reduces supply elasticity, causing higher prices, greater volatility
- Reviews theories of regulation's origins, with evidence suggesting homeowner interests (protecting property values) dominate
- **Key question:** Whose interests should land use policy serve—existing homeowners or broader welfare?

**Glaeser & Gyourko (2018) - "The Economic Implications of Housing Supply"** [ESSENTIAL]
- Shows elasticity determines whether demand raises prices vs. quantities
- During 1980s boom: 29% price growth in inelastic metros vs. 3.4% in elastic metros
- Counterfactual: If all metros as elastic as median, US housing stock would be 15 million units larger
- **Magnitude:** Regulation shapes who can access productive cities, with enormous distributional consequences

### Spatial Misallocation and Aggregate Costs

**Hsieh & Moretti (2019) - "Housing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation"** [HEADLINE FINDING]
- **The key empirical result:** Housing supply constraints in high-productivity cities (NYC, SF, SJ) reduced US GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009
- Mechanism: Stringent zoning/regulations in productive cities raised housing costs, preventing worker in-migration
- Lowering constraints in just NYC, San Francisco, San Jose to median would increase GDP by 8.9%
- **For normative debates:** Quantifies aggregate costs of exclusionary policies—these are first-order effects on national welfare, not just local concerns

**Ganong & Shoag (2017) - "Why Has Regional Income Convergence Declined?"** [ESSENTIAL FOR JUSTICE]
- US states experienced steady income convergence 1880-1980 (1.8%/year) as workers migrated from low-wage to high-wage states
- **This convergence stopped after 1980** due to land-use restrictions raising housing costs in high-income states
- High housing costs prevent low-income workers from accessing high-wage regions: attorneys can still afford to move (housing 21% of income) but janitors cannot (rent 52% of income)
- **Direct evidence** that exclusionary housing policies create spatial injustice by blocking economic mobility for those who need it most

**Autor, Dorn & Hanson (2013) - "The China Syndrome"**
- Rising Chinese import competition 1990-2007 caused higher unemployment, lower wages in manufacturing-dependent local labor markets
- Import competition explains 25% of aggregate manufacturing employment decline
- **Shows spatial lock-in:** Workers in declining regions face substantial barriers to moving to growing regions, contrary to assumptions of frictionless mobility

**Saks (2008) - "Job Creation and Housing Construction"**
- For equal labor demand shocks, highly regulated places see 17% smaller housing expansion and nearly double the price increase
- Employment response to demand is <0.8% in constrained vs. 1% in unconstrained places
- **Housing constraints don't just affect housing markets—they directly limit employment growth and economic opportunity**

### Land Values, Amenities, and Spatial Sorting

**Albouy (2016) - "What Are Cities Worth?"**
- Wage and housing cost differences explained more by productivity than amenity differences
- Most productive cities are coastal, sunny, mild, educated, and large
- **Normative insight:** Productivity-based land values (from agglomeration, public investment) arguably should be shared more broadly than amenity-based values

**Albouy, Ehrlich & Shin (2018) - "Metropolitan Land Values"**
- Total urban land values estimated at more than 2x GDP in 2006
- Five major agglomerations (NY, LA, SF, DC, Boston) account for 48% of all US urban land value
- **Extreme concentration** raises questions about whether such value should be captured locally or shared nationally

**Couture et al. (2019) - "Income Growth and the Distributional Effects of Urban Spatial Sorting"**
- As rich get richer, their increased demand for downtown amenities drives housing prices up in central cities
- Rising incomes explain ~50% of urbanization of rich (top decile) and suburbanization of poor (bottom decile)
- Poor residents either displaced or pay higher rents for amenities they value less
- **Income inequality manifests spatially** through neighborhood sorting with distributional consequences

### Gentrification and Neighborhood Change

**Ellen & O'Regan (2011) - "How Low Income Neighborhoods Change"**
- Using confidential Census data tracking individuals during 1990s, finds no evidence of heightened displacement of original homeowners
- Income gains from: higher-income entrants, selective exit of lower-income, income gains by stayers
- **Nuances displacement narratives:** Original homeowners often benefit from neighborhood improvement

**Dragan, Ellen & Glied (2020) - "Does Gentrification Displace Poor Children?"**
- Longitudinal NYC Medicaid data 2009-2015 finds no meaningful change in mobility rates from gentrification
- Children in gentrifying areas experience larger environmental improvements than those in persistently low-SES areas
- **Most rigorous recent evidence** but focuses on very low-income families (Medicaid-eligible) in rent-regulated NYC

### Path Dependency and Institutional Lock-in

**Fischel (2001) - "The Homevoter Hypothesis"** [ESSENTIAL FOR POLITICAL ECONOMY]
- Homeowners dominate local government because home values serve as report card for policies
- Unlike diversified stockholders, homeowners have most wealth in single illiquid asset → intense interest in local governance
- Explains fragmented metro governance, restrictive zoning, suburban sprawl, resistance to affordable housing
- **Key insight:** If correct, local control over land use inevitably produces exclusion when homeowners dominate
- **Normative question:** Does this require overriding homeowner preferences through higher-level government?

**Baum-Snow (2007) - "Did Highways Cause Suburbanization?"** [PATH DEPENDENCY EXEMPLAR]
- Uses planned 1947 highway routes as exogenous variation
- Each highway ray through central city reduced its population by ~18%
- **Demonstrates path dependency:** Infrastructure investments from 1950s-70s created suburban patterns persisting today
- **Once highways enabled suburban development, reversal nearly impossible**—sunk investments create spatial lock-in

### Accessible Syntheses

**Glaeser (2011) - "Triumph of the City"**
- Cities are engines of innovation, prosperity, sustainability despite common perception
- Main urban problems (high costs, poverty) stem from restrictive zoning, not inherent urban features
- Frames affordability as policy failure, suggesting reforms could expand access

**Moretti (2012) - "The New Geography of Jobs"**
- Innovation economy jobs concentrating in "brain hubs" while other cities decline
- Winner-take-all geography has accelerated post-1980
- Accessible demonstration that spatial inequalities growing despite globalization/internet

## How These Findings Connect to Philosophical Debates

### 1. Non-Fungibility of Location

The agglomeration literature (Duranton & Puga, Rosenthal & Strange, Combes & Gobillon) establishes that places differ fundamentally in economic opportunity due to productivity effects that cannot be replicated elsewhere. A job in San Francisco is not equivalent to the "same" job in a declining rust-belt city because the San Francisco location provides:
- 2-5% higher wages for equivalent worker (after controlling for selection)
- Better job matches through thicker labor markets
- Knowledge spillovers and learning opportunities
- Local multipliers (5 additional service jobs per high-tech job)

**Philosophical implication:** Location is not fungible. Housing policy that restricts geographic mobility is not merely about shelter but about access to fundamentally different economic opportunities.

### 2. Created vs. Inherited Value

Albouy (2016) and Albouy et al. (2018) decompose urban land values into productivity (agglomeration effects, public infrastructure) vs. amenities (weather, geography). Finding that productivity explains more of value differences than amenities suggests much urban land value stems from:
- Positive externalities (agglomeration spillovers)
- Public investment (infrastructure, schools, transit)
- Collective action and historical accumulation

**Philosophical implication:** Current residents did not create most location-specific value, raising questions about their claim to exclusively capture it through property appreciation or exclusionary zoning.

### 3. Temporal Injustice and Path Dependency

Baum-Snow (2007) demonstrates how infrastructure decisions from 1950s-70s created suburban development patterns persisting today. Fischel (2001) shows how homeowner-dominated local control leads to exclusionary policies protecting property values. Together these establish:
- Past decisions (highway routing, initial zoning) constrain current options
- Once spatial patterns established (suburban sprawl, car-dependency), reversal extremely difficult
- Current generation inherits spatial configuration limiting their choices

**Philosophical implication:** Past generations' decisions impose costs on current/future generations who have no voice in those decisions. This is paradigmatic temporal injustice.

### 4. Magnitude of Exclusion and Aggregate Harm

Hsieh & Moretti (2019) quantifies that housing constraints reduced US GDP by 36% over 45 years. Ganong & Shoag (2017) shows regional convergence—the mechanism that reduced spatial inequality for a century—stopped in 1980 due to housing costs. Glaeser & Gyourko (2018) estimates 15 million fewer housing units due to constraints.

**Philosophical implication:** These are not marginal effects. The scale of exclusion and aggregate harm establishes that this is a fundamental justice issue, not just efficiency concern or local land-use preference.

### 5. Distributive Justice and Homevoter Politics

Moretti (2011) shows low-skilled workers benefit 3-5x more from agglomeration than high-skilled workers, but Ganong & Shoag (2017) demonstrates housing costs now prevent low-skilled mobility while high-skilled can still move. Fischel (2001) explains this is rational homeowner behavior to protect property values.

**Philosophical implication:** Exclusionary housing policies systematically benefit those already advantaged (high-income homeowners in productive cities) while harming those who would benefit most (low-income workers seeking opportunity). The political economy is structurally biased against those excluded.

## Economic Mechanisms Most Relevant to Normative Questions

### 1. Agglomeration as Non-Fungible Public Good
Agglomeration economies are:
- Created collectively through density and interaction
- Generate positive externalities (knowledge spillovers)
- Cannot be replicated in other locations
- Provide greatest benefits to low-skilled workers (high multipliers)

→ **Normative question:** Should access to these collectively-created benefits be excludable?

### 2. Housing Supply Elasticity as Distributional Mechanism
Supply elasticity determines whether productivity growth manifests as:
- **Elastic supply:** More people access opportunities (population growth)
- **Inelastic supply:** Existing residents capture gains (price appreciation)

→ **Normative question:** Should housing policy enable opportunity sharing (elastic) or value capture (inelastic)?

### 3. Spatial Lock-in and Stranded Populations
Trade shocks (Autor et al.) and housing costs (Ganong & Shoag) create populations trapped between:
- Declining opportunities in origin regions (manufacturing collapse)
- Inaccessible opportunities in destination regions (unaffordable housing)

→ **Normative question:** What obligations do growing regions have to declining regions? Can barriers to mobility be justified?

### 4. Path Dependency and Inherited Constraints
Infrastructure (Baum-Snow) and institutions (Fischel) create spatial configurations that:
- Persist across generations (sunk costs, lock-in)
- Benefit some while harming others
- Were decided without input from those affected

→ **Normative question:** Can current generation be bound by past decisions they didn't make? What claims do future generations have?

### 5. Homevoter Hypothesis and Local Control
If Fischel is correct that homeowner-dominated local control inevitably produces exclusion:
- Local democracy systematically excludes non-residents
- Those excluded have no voice in decisions that harm them
- Aggregate welfare sacrificed for local property values

→ **Normative question:** What is legitimate scope of local control over land use when local decisions have metropolitan/national effects?

- Housing constraints create spatial injustice by preventing access to high-productivity cities
- Magnitude is enormous: 36% GDP loss, convergence stopped, 15M fewer housing units
- Political economy (homevoter) structurally biased toward exclusion
- Path dependency means current generation inherits constraints from past decisions
- These economic findings establish empirical foundation for normative arguments
