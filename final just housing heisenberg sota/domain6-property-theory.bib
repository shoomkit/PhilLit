====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Property theory in philosophy examines the normative foundations and
justifications for property rights. Classical debates center on whether
property rights are grounded in labor (Locke), occupancy/first possession,
personality development (Hegel), or social convention and utility. Contemporary
work has moved beyond monolithic theories to recognize property as a "bundle
of rights" (Honoré) or a pluralistic set of institutions serving multiple
values (Dagan). Recent scholarship has increasingly focused on how property
theory relates to housing justice, examining the property rights of tenants
and renters, the normative basis of adverse possession and squatting, and how
occupancy-based claims challenge traditional ownership models. The emergence
of "occupancy rights" theory (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein) represents a
significant development, arguing that long-term occupancy and use can ground
property-like claims even without formal ownership.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is foundational for understanding how temporal claims to housing
might be grounded in property theory. The tension between formal ownership
and occupancy-based rights is central to housing justice debates. Property
theory provides conceptual frameworks for evaluating whether and when renters,
long-term occupants, or even squatters can claim property-like protections.
The distinction between use rights and ownership rights, and theories of how
property serves personhood and community, directly inform normative arguments
about housing security and tenant protections.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen significant philosophical attention to housing justice
as a distinct area of applied property theory. Scholars increasingly examine
how property rights interact with housing precarity, gentrification, and
homelessness. The development of "occupancy rights" as a theoretical framework
(distinct from both ownership and mere possession) represents an important
conceptual innovation. There's also growing interest in how property theory
must account for "located life plans" and the embeddedness of persons in
particular places, challenging traditional fungible conceptions of property.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
While recent work has explored homelessness and gentrification, there remains
limited philosophical work on the specific property rights of long-term renters
and how temporal occupancy might ground incremental rights. The relationship
between adverse possession doctrine and normative housing claims is
under-theorized in contemporary philosophy (though legal scholars like Claeys
and Harding have made contributions). More work is needed on how property
pluralism (Dagan) applies specifically to residential property versus other
forms of property.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on the conceptual distinction between ownership, use rights, and
occupancy rights as these are central to temporal housing claims. Stilz's
occupancy theory and Wells's work on limited property rights for renters
provide key frameworks. The classic debate between labor theory (Locke),
personality theory (Hegel/Radin), and institutional pluralism (Dagan) should
frame the theoretical landscape. Pay special attention to how property theory
addresses housing specifically (Waldron, Essert, Halliday & Meyer) versus
property in general.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that homelessness is fundamentally a freedom problem, not just a resource problem. Everything that is done must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform an action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. Homeless people lack freedom because they have no space under their exclusive control where they can perform basic life activities without permission. Private property and restrictive public space rules combine to make the exercise of basic freedoms effectively impossible for homeless people. RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding how property rights and spatial control relate to housing justice. Shifts the debate from charity/welfare to freedom and rights. Directly relevant to our project's concern with how temporal occupancy and control relate to fundamental freedoms and whether housing security should be understood as a property right rather than merely a welfare concern.

Argues that people who occupy and use a place over time develop legitimate claims to remain there, even if they don't own the property. Removal from one's place of long-term occupancy is a distinctive moral wrong because it disrupts located life plans and severs connections to place that are constitutive of identity and projects. Distinguished from both full ownership rights and mere possession. RELEVANCE: Central theoretical framework for temporal claims to housing. Provides philosophical grounding for why duration of occupancy matters morally and can generate rights-like protections. Directly applicable to tenant protections, gentrification resistance, and housing security arguments. Key reference for occupancy-based property theory as applied to housing contexts.

Part I argues for a right of occupancy, holding that a legitimate function of political/legal systems is to specify and protect people's pre-institutional claims to specific geographical places based on their residence and use. Territorial rights are justified by three core values: occupancy (protecting located life plans), basic justice (meeting fundamental needs), and collective self-determination. RELEVANCE: Provides book-length development of occupancy theory applicable to housing. While focused on state territory, the occupancy framework translates to individual housing claims. Relevant for understanding how temporal residence generates legitimate expectations and claims to place. Provides theoretical resources for thinking about housing as territorially-bounded rights.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that homelessness should be understood not as lack of goods or access to goods, but as lack of property rights - specifically, lack of any space under one's exclusive control. Homeless people are subject to domination and dependence because they have no territorial security. The solution to homelessness requires conferring property rights (not just providing shelter), because property rights uniquely solve the freedom/domination problem by creating a sphere of exclusive control. Distinguishes between shelter (meeting biological needs) and home (having property rights over space). RELEVANCE: Builds on Waldron's freedom argument to make case that housing justice requires property rights, not just welfare provision. Directly relevant to question of what kind of rights temporal occupants should have and why use/occupancy must be secured through property-like rights rather than revocable permissions. Connects property theory to housing justice in fundamental way. POSITION: Property rights solution to homelessness - homelessness as rights deficit rather than resource deficit.},

Argues that "full liberal ownership" involves holding most (not necessarily all) of these incidents. Provides conceptual framework for understanding property as disaggregatable bundle rather than monolithic right. RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding how property rights can be divided and distributed. Crucial for analyzing tenant rights - tenants hold some incidents (use, possession) but not others (alienation, indefinite duration). Allows for nuanced analysis of how temporal occupancy might ground some property incidents even without full ownership. Framework for thinking about incremental rights accumulation over time.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops Hegelian theory that certain property is essential to personhood and self-development. Distinguishes between "personal property" (bound up with personhood) and "fungible property" (held purely instrumentally). Personal property deserves stronger legal protection because it is constitutive of identity and necessary for flourishing. Homes are paradigm cases of personal property because of their role in self-constitution, relationships, and life projects. Property law should recognize this distinction and protect personal property more robustly than fungible property. RELEVANCE: Provides normative framework for why homes deserve special property protections beyond other forms of property. Suggests that residential property occupied over time becomes "personal" and thus merits stronger protection against dispossession. Relevant to arguments for enhanced tenant protections and why temporal occupancy creates stakes beyond mere economic interests. Influential in housing law and gentrification debates.

  doi = {10.3138/utlj.58.3.275},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "exclusivity model" of ownership as alternative to traditional exclusion-focused accounts. Ownership's central concern is not excluding others from the owned thing, but preserving the owner's position as exclusive agenda-setter for the thing. Owners need not exclude others; they must only ensure others' uses are consistent with the owner's agenda. This explains why owners can grant limited rights (like leases) without losing ownership - subsidiary right-holders act within owner's agenda. Ownership is about governance/control, not mere boundary-maintenance. RELEVANCE: Provides sophisticated account of how ownership and subsidiary rights (like tenancy) relate. Relevant for understanding landlord-tenant relationships and whether/how tenants' temporal claims might evolve into ownership-like agenda-setting authority. Challenges simple exclusion model and opens conceptual space for recognizing occupants' claims to control use even without formal ownership. Useful for theorizing incremental rights accumulation.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Rejects both monistic property theory (Blackstonian sole and despotic dominion) and formless bundle-of-rights view. Instead, conceptualizes property as umbrella for family of distinct institutions (fee simple, lease, mortgage, easement, etc.), each tailored to specific social contexts and serving different balances of property values. Property serves pluralistic liberal values: autonomy, utility, labor, personhood, community, and distributive justice. Different property institutions emphasize different values. Property law should craft diverse configurations of rights suited to different social settings. RELEVANCE: Provides framework for thinking about residential property as potentially distinct institution from other property forms, with its own value balance emphasizing personhood, community, and security over alienability. Supports idea that housing should be governed by different property rules than commercial or investment property. Relevant to justifying special protections for residential tenants based on different value priorities.

  doi = {10.1177/1470594X16653859},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines Rawlsian right to personal property, arguing that Rawlsian theory cannot justify a basic right to property as extensive as full liberal ownership. What can be justified is a more limited set of rights comparable to rights over rented objects - essentially lease rights rather than ownership rights. Defends right to privately control housing and personal items, but this right is more limited than traditional ownership (lacks perpetual duration, alienation rights, etc.). Suggests property rights for basic goods should look more like tenancy than fee simple ownership. RELEVANCE: Directly addresses what property rights people can claim over housing. Argues for reconceptualizing basic property rights as lease-like rather than ownership-like - highly relevant to tenant rights and temporal housing claims. Provides Rawlsian framework for limited but secure property rights over housing based on occupancy and use rather than full ownership.

Key feature is right to live alone (not forced into communal housing). Where individuals must share housing due to resource constraints, their basic rights are violated. Right is to lease-like control (use, possession, security of tenure) for fixed term, not perpetual ownership. Argues this is what justice requires for housing, combining security with reasonable limits on property claims. Temporal dimension (minimum 3 years) ensures sufficient stability for life planning. RELEVANCE: Provides specific proposal for temporal housing rights grounded in political philosophy. Directly addresses how long occupancy must be secured (minimum 3 years) and what bundle of rights it includes (lease rights). Highly relevant to tenant protections and temporal housing claims. Combines philosophical justification with concrete policy implications. Important reference for minimum temporal security requirements.

Develops concept of "located life plans" - human plans, projects, and relationships are intertwined with spatial arrangements, particularly one's dwelling place. Long-term residents develop occupancy rights based on their investment in place-specific projects and relationships. Gentrification-driven displacement wrongs residents by disrupting their located life plans. This wrong is distinct from distributive injustice and occurs even if displaced residents receive compensation. Argues for limiting gentrification's impact on existing residents.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends certain forms of squatting using Locke's spoilage proviso. Locke argued that one must not appropriate more than one can use without spoilage; this proviso limits both initial appropriation and continued retention of property. When legal owners let buildings fall into dereliction/abandonment, they violate the spoilage proviso and lose their legitimate property claim. Squatters who occupy abandoned buildings and put them to productive use have superior claim based on Lockean labor theory. Uses case studies where squatters reversed building dereliction. Argues for occupation-based property rights over formal title when owners fail to use property. RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical justification for adverse possession and squatting in housing contexts. Relevant to debates about vacant/abandoned properties and whether occupancy/use can trump formal ownership. Shows how classical property theory (Locke) can ground occupancy-based claims.

  note = {Original work published 1689. CORE ARGUMENT: Develops influential labor theory of property: God gave the earth to mankind in common, but individuals can appropriate unowned resources by mixing their labor with them. Labor creates property rights because each person owns their own body and thus owns their labor. Property appropriation is legitimate when: (1) enough and as good is left for others (sufficiency proviso), (2) one doesn't appropriate more than one can use without spoilage (spoilage proviso). Property precedes government and exists in state of nature. Government's role is to protect pre-existing property rights. RELEVANCE: Foundational text for labor/desert theories of property. Provisos (sufficiency, spoilage) provide resources for limiting property claims and justifying redistribution.

Persons become actual (not merely abstract) by embodying their will in external objects through property. Property allows individuals to develop as free, self-determining agents and to be recognized by others as such. Property rights are constitutive of personhood rather than merely instrumental. Free exchange of property mediates intersubjectivity and develops personality. Property is necessary stage in development from abstract personhood to ethical life in community and state. Ownership is about self-actualization through external objectification of will. RELEVANCE: Foundational for personhood theories of property (Radin builds on Hegel).

Holdings are just if acquired and transferred justly, regardless of resulting distribution. Defends minimal state and argues taxation for redistribution violates property rights. Includes Lockean proviso that appropriation cannot worsen others' positions. Sees strong property rights as foundation for liberty; redistribution as coercive.

Shows that Marxist exploitation critique actually presupposes self-ownership, creating tension in Marxist theory. Argues for egalitarian distribution of external resources to make self-ownership meaningful. Self-ownership plus unequal resource distribution yields unfreedom for the poor.
