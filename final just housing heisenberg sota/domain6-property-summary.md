**Search Date**: 2025-11-14
**Papers Found**: 18 total (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
**Output File**: `domain6-property-theory.bib`

## Search Overview

This search focused on property theory with emphasis on occupancy-based claims, use rights, and how property theory relates to housing justice. I conducted extensive web searches across Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, PhilPapers, Google Scholar, law journal databases, and SSRN to identify foundational texts, contemporary scholarship, and recent developments (2010-2025).

## Key Papers and Main Arguments

### Occupancy Rights Theory (Core Framework)

1. **Anna Stilz - "Occupancy Rights and the Wrong of Removal" (2013)** [HIGH]
   - Develops theory that long-term occupancy grounds legitimate claims to remain in place
   - "Located life plans" are intertwined with spatial arrangements
   - Removal from long-term dwelling is distinctive moral wrong beyond property violation
   - **Why it matters**: Provides philosophical foundation for temporal housing claims

2. **Anna Stilz - "Territorial Sovereignty" (2019)** [MEDIUM]
   - Book-length development of occupancy theory

   - Seminal article arguing homelessness is a freedom problem, not just resource deficit
   - "Everything that is done must be done somewhere"
   - Homeless people lack spatial control necessary for basic freedoms
   - **Why it matters**: Reframes housing as rights/freedom issue rather than welfare

5. **Christopher Essert - "Property and Homelessness" (2016)** [HIGH]
   - Homelessness is lack of property rights (exclusive control over space)
   - Solution requires conferring property rights, not just providing shelter
   - Homelessness = domination due to lack of territorial security
   - **Why it matters**: Makes case that housing justice requires property rights

### Renters' Rights and Limited Property

6. **Katy Wells - "The Right to Personal Property" (2016)** [HIGH]
   - Rawlsian analysis argues basic property right should be lease-like, not ownership

   - **Why it matters**: Concrete proposal connecting philosophy to temporal housing policy

### Property Theory Foundations

8. **A.M. Honoré - "Ownership" (1961)** [HIGH]
   - Classic "bundle of rights" analysis: 11 incidents of ownership
   - Shows property is disaggregatable, not monolithic

### Classical Texts

12. **John Locke - "Two Treatises of Government" (1689/1988)** [HIGH]
    - Labor theory: mixing labor with resources creates property
    - Spoilage proviso: can't appropriate more than you can use
    - Sufficiency proviso: must leave "enough and as good" for others

### Adverse Possession and Squatting

16. **Eloise Harding - "Spoilage and Squatting: A Lockean Argument" (2019)** [MEDIUM]
    - Defends squatting using Locke's spoilage proviso

    - Natural law framework for adverse possession

## Major Theoretical Positions

### 1. **Occupancy Rights Theory** (4 papers)
- **Key scholars**: Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein, Harding
- **Core idea**: Temporal occupancy and use ground property-like claims distinct from ownership
- **Application**: Tenant protections, anti-gentrification, squatters' rights

### 2. **Property and Homelessness** (3 papers)
- **Key scholars**: Waldron, Essert, Jenkins & Brownlee
- **Core idea**: Homelessness is rights/freedom deficit requiring property rights, not just shelter
- **Application**: Housing as human right, security of tenure

### 3. **Personhood/Development Theory** (3 papers)
- **Key scholars**: Hegel, Radin, Cohen
- **Core idea**: Property essential to personhood, self-development, and freedom
- **Application**: Special protection for residential property as "personal property"

### 4. **Bundle of Rights/Institutional Pluralism** (3 papers)
- **Key scholars**: Honoré, Dagan, Katz
- **Core idea**: Property is disaggregatable bundle or family of institutions
- **Application**: Analyzing partial rights, different property forms for different contexts

### 5. **Labor/Desert Theory** (3 papers)
- **Key scholars**: Locke, Claeys, Nozick (with variations)
- **Core idea**: Labor/productive use creates property entitlements
- **Application**: Adverse possession, squatting, limits on non-use

### 6. **Renters' Rights and Limited Property** (2 papers)
- **Key scholar**: Wells
- **Core idea**: Basic property right should be lease-like (secure use) not full ownership
- **Application**: Tenant rights, minimum lease terms (3+ years)

## How Property Theory Connects to Housing Justice

### Conceptual Innovations

1. **Occupancy vs. Ownership**: Recent work (Stilz, Huber & Wolkenstein) distinguishes occupancy rights from both full ownership and mere possession, creating middle category highly relevant to tenant protections.

2. **Use Rights vs. Ownership Rights**: Wells argues basic property rights should be reconceived as lease-like (use, possession, security) rather than ownership-like (alienation, indefinite duration), directly applicable to housing.

3. **Personal vs. Fungible Property**: Radin's distinction explains why homes deserve special protection - they're constitutive of personhood, not merely instrumental.

4. **Property as Freedom**: Waldron and Essert shift debate from "housing as welfare" to "housing as property rights necessary for freedom" - fundamentally different normative framework.

### Practical Implications

1. **Temporal Requirements**: Wells specifies minimum 3-year secure tenure; this connects philosophical arguments to concrete policy.

2. **Gentrification Limits**: Huber & Wolkenstein provide normative framework for restricting displacement based on occupancy rights and located life plans.

3. **Adverse Possession/Squatting**: Harding and Claeys show how classical property theory (Locke) justifies occupancy-based claims against formal title in cases of abandonment/non-use.

4. **Bundle Disaggregation**: Honoré's framework allows analysis of how tenants hold some property incidents (use, possession) while landlords hold others (alienation, reversion).

## Particularly Influential Works

1. **Waldron (1991)** - Most cited work on homelessness and property; reframed entire debate
2. **Stilz (2013)** - Foundational for occupancy rights theory now widely applied
3. **Radin (1982)** - One of 100 most cited legal articles; personhood theory highly influential
4. **Honoré (1961)** - Bundle of rights framework is standard conceptual tool in property law
5. **Wells (2016, 2019)** - Most direct philosophical work on tenant rights and temporal housing claims

## Recent Developments (2015-2025)

- **Occupancy rights** emerging as distinct theoretical framework (Stilz's 2013 article has generated significant follow-up)
- **Housing justice** recognized as distinct area of applied property theory (Halliday & Meyer 2024 survey shows growth)
- **Gentrification** receiving serious philosophical attention (not just policy analysis)
- **Macroeconomic factors** increasingly recognized as important for housing justice (Halliday & Meyer call)
- **Temporal dimensions** of property rights receiving more attention (Wells on minimum tenure, Harding on temporal use justifying claims)

## Notable Gaps

1. **Limited work specifically on long-term renters' evolving rights** - Most work is either on homelessness or full ownership; middle category of long-term tenancy under-theorized
2. **Adverse possession in housing contexts** remains primarily in legal scholarship (Claeys, Harding) rather than mainstream philosophy
3. **Property pluralism** (Dagan) not yet fully applied to residential vs. other property types
4. **Temporal accumulation of rights** - little work on whether/how property rights strengthen with duration of occupancy

## Verification Notes

All papers included have been verified through web searches. DOIs obtained where available (most papers from 2000+ have DOIs; earlier papers often don't). Classic texts (Locke, Hegel, Nozick) included in standard editions. All citations cross-checked against multiple sources to ensure accuracy.

No papers were fabricated or included without verification. Where DOIs weren't available (particularly older articles like Waldron 1991), this is noted by absence of DOI field in BibTeX entry.
