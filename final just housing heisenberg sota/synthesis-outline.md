## Section 1: Introduction - The Temporal Puzzle of Housing as a Located Good
**Word Target**: 500-600 words
**Key Papers**: Hirsch 1976, Walzer 1983, Stilz 2013/2019, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024, Hsieh & Moretti 2019

**Content**:
- **Opening**: Housing is fundamentally different from fungible goods assumed by standard distributive justice theories
  - Cannot be redistributed like income or moved like personal property
  - Value inseparable from location (Hirsch's positional goods)
  - Urban economics confirms: agglomeration creates 10-30% wage premiums, $2+ trillion in concentrated land value
- **The core puzzle**: Competing temporal claims create distinctive justice problem
  - Incumbents: past occupancy, place attachment, community investment, located life plans
  - Newcomers: current housing need, equal access to opportunity, non-discrimination
  - Future generations: claims to housing in productive cities
- **Theoretical challenge**: Standard frameworks inadequate
  - Rawlsian distributive justice treats goods as fungible - doesn't capture place-specificity
  - Property theory focuses on ownership - misses occupancy-based claims of renters
  - Historical justice addresses past wrongs - but how long do historical claims persist?
- **Empirical stakes**: Not marginal - housing constraints reduced US GDP 36% (1964-2009)
- **Preview**: Review organizes around three key debates
  1. Whether spatial justice is autonomous field or derivative of general principles
  2. Supersession debate - do changed circumstances override historical claims?
  3. Occupancy vs. property rights - what grounds temporal claims to place?

**Synthesis Goal**: Establish that temporal claims to located goods require distinctive theoretical treatment, not just application of existing frameworks

## Section 2: Located Goods and the Limits of Standard Distributive Justice
**Word Target**: 750-900 words
**Key Papers**: Rawls 1971, Dworkin 1981, Walzer 1983, Anderson 1999, Sen 1999, Soja 2010, Basta 2016, Moroni 2020, Israel & Frenkel 2018, Shelby 2016, Dummer & Neuhäuser 2025

**Content**:

**2.1 The Fungibility Assumption in Mainstream Theory**
- Rawls: primary goods as all-purpose means, location-neutral
- Dworkin: equality of resources via auction - assumes fungible bundles subject to envy test
- Problem: Housing is not fungible. Can't auction "good locations" without remainder - someone must live in less productive cities
- Spatial scarcity creates distinctive allocation problem

**2.2 Alternative Frameworks**
- **Walzer's pluralism**: Spheres of justice - different goods, different principles
  - Housing as distinct sphere with own distributive logic
  - Anti-dominance: wealth shouldn't automatically convert to housing access
  - But: doesn't specify which principles govern housing sphere
- **Capabilities approach** (Sen, Nussbaum, Basta 2016):
  - Same resources yield different capabilities in different places
  - "Spatial primary goods" (Basta) - location matters for converting resources to functionings
  - Israel & Frenkel: operationalize spatial justice via capabilities + Bourdieu's capitals
  - Dummer & Neuhäuser 2025: Housing has positional and relational dimensions beyond sufficiency
- **Relational egalitarianism** (Anderson, Scheffler):
  - Justice about social relations, not just distributions
  - Shelby 2016: segregated ghettos violate civic equality and reciprocity
  - Anderson 2010: integration imperative - segregation perpetuates inequality
  - Critique: Focus on outcomes (integrated neighborhoods) may conflict with incumbent protection

**2.3 Spatial Justice as Autonomous or Derivative?**
- **Autonomy view** (Soja 2010, Harvey 1973): Geography constitutes injustice, not just distributes it
  - Spatial arrangements actively produce inequality
  - "Right to the city" as collective democratic control
- **Derivative view** (Moroni 2020): Spatial justice applies general justice principles to geographic contexts
  - Institutional justice (property rules, zoning) is primary, not spatial patterns
  - Spatial outcomes reflect institutional frameworks
- **Synthesis need**: Located goods may require specific principles while remaining connected to general justice frameworks

**Key Debate**: Can mainstream distributive justice (Rawls, Dworkin, capabilities) accommodate located goods, or do we need autonomous "spatial justice" principles (Soja, Harvey)?

**Transition**: Even if we develop principles for distributing located goods, temporal dimension remains - how do claims evolve over time?

## Section 3: Temporal Justice and the Supersession Debate
**Word Target**: 800-1000 words
**Key Papers**: Waldron 1992, Thompson 2002, Butt 2009/2012, Meyer & Waligore 2022, Gosseries 2023, Goodin 2010, Bidadanure 2021, Truccone 2024, Caney 2014, Luoma & Moore 2024

**Content**:

**3.1 Waldron's Supersession Thesis**
- Core claim: Changed circumstances can morally supersede historical injustice
  - Distribution unjust at T1 may become not-unjust at T2 given population growth, environmental change, new needs
  - Paradigm: Indigenous land claims after centuries of settlement
- Application to housing: Does gentrification supersede earlier residents' historical claims?
  - Urban development, demographic change, economic transformation as "morally relevant changed circumstances"?

**3.2 Anti-Supersession Responses**
- **Thompson 2002**: Intergenerational obligations persist across political societies
  - Nations must keep commitments and repair injustices of predecessors
  - Displacement creates enduring moral debts even across generations
- **Butt 2009**: Three temporal connections create persistent obligations
  - Benefit (unjust enrichment), Entitlement (wrongful taking), Responsibility (institutional succession)
  - Current property distributions reflect past redlining, urban renewal, discriminatory lending
- **Meyer & Waligore 2022**: Sophisticated distinctions
  - Partial vs. full supersession
  - Dormant (for-the-time-being) vs. final (for-all-time) supersession
  - What counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances"?
- **Luoma & Moore 2024**: Occupancy theory handles rectification better than pure historical entitlement
  - Current occupancy generates claims even without clean historical title
  - But historical injustice still matters for determining rectification duties

**3.3 Diachronic vs. Synchronic Justice**
- **Goodin 2010**: Temporal justice - distribution of discretionary time, temporal autonomy
  - Housing affects life-course planning, not just current resources
  - Long commutes from affordable housing = temporal injustice (time poverty)
- **Bidadanure 2021**: Age-group justice requires both synchronic and diachronic evaluation
  - Some inequalities acceptable across life course but not between cohorts
  - Young adults priced out of urban housing: age-group inequality or generational injustice?
  - Depends whether temporary (life-stage) or permanent (cohort stratification)
- **Truccone 2024**: Must reconcile reparative (backward-looking) and distributive (forward-looking) justice
  - Not choose between them - integrate both
  - Housing policy must address both historical wrongs and current needs
- **Caney 2014**: Pure temporal discounting (future people matter less) is unjust discrimination
  - Future generations' housing needs matter equally to current displacement concerns
  - But: epistemic uncertainty about future (who will live where?)

**3.4 Path Dependency and Moral Lock-In**
- Past decisions constrain present options even if historical claims don't persist indefinitely
- Urban form shaped by highway investments (Baum-Snow 2007), zoning enacted decades ago
- Creates structural constraints on just allocation - can't easily reverse spatial lock-in
- Raises question: Does path dependency create obligations even absent historical injustice claims?

**Key Debate**: Do gentrification and neighborhood change constitute "morally relevant changed circumstances" that supersede incumbent claims? Or do historical displacement and community investment create persistent rights?

**Transition**: Beyond general temporal justice principles, specific theory of occupancy rights has emerged to address place-based claims...

## Section 4: Occupancy Rights and Place-Based Temporal Claims
**Word Target**: 800-1000 words
**Key Papers**: Stilz 2009/2013/2019/2024, Moore 2012/2015, Nine 2012/2022/2025, Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024, van Leeuwen 2025, Miller 2012, Pevnick 2011, Kolers 2009

**Content**:

**4.1 Stilz's Occupancy Theory**
- **Foundation** (Stilz 2009, 2019): Occupancy rights ground territorial claims
  - People develop "located life plans" - projects and relationships intertwined with specific places
  - Occupancy right = stable possession of geographical space needed for central life projects
  - Distinct from property (transferable) and from mere possession (revocable)
  - Three core values: occupancy (stability for projects), basic justice (fair institutions), collective self-determination
- **Anti-displacement** (Stilz 2013): Removal from place of occupancy is distinctive wrong
  - Severs connections constitutive of identity and agency
  - Disrupts ability to be author of one's life commitments
  - Established through temporal residence and participation in ongoing practices
- **Temporal dimension**: Occupancy strengthens over time through:
  - Deepening place attachment
  - Investment in place-specific projects
  - Formation of non-transferable relationships and commitments
- **Independence from historical title** (Stilz 2019): Crucially, occupancy rights can arise even after unjust dispossession
  - Current occupants have genuine claims despite neighborhood's unjust origins (redlining, etc.)
  - Helps address path dependency problem

**4.2 Self-Determination and Territorial Rights**
- **Moore 2015**: Political self-determination theory
  - Peoples (not just states) have territorial rights through legitimate occupancy
  - Collective moral rights of occupancy + individual residency rights + self-determination
  - Time matters: longer occupancy strengthens claims
  - Must balance past wrongs against present occupancy
- **Nine 2012, 2022**: Alternative "river model" - foundational territories
  - Territory emerges from interdependence in managing shared resource systems
  - Overlapping, nested jurisdictions rather than exclusive bounded units
  - Neighborhoods as foundational territories with overlapping claims
  - Challenges winner-take-all displacement logic
- **Miller 2012**: Nationalist account
  - National communities develop territorial claims through long-term occupancy and landscape shaping
  - Cultural integration with place grounds rights
  - Question: Does this extend to neighborhood-level cultural communities?

**4.3 Urban Applications: Gentrification and Displacement**
- **Huber & Wolkenstein 2018**: First systematic application to gentrification
  - "Located life plans" concept - human projects tied to spatial arrangements
  - Gentrification-driven displacement violates occupancy rights
  - Wrong distinct from distributive injustice - persists even with compensation
- **Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024**: Pluralistic place-based account (most recent, most detailed)
  - Three types of place-related rights gentrification violates:
    1. Rights to a home (secure shelter, private space)
    2. Rights of residency (stable political membership, participation)
    3. Place-based rights to community (valued social relationships tied to place)
  - Gentrification wrongs by disrupting multiple forms of attachment simultaneously
  - Temporal attachment deepens all three types of claims
- **van Leeuwen 2025**: Critical examination
  - Autonomy-based accounts face challenges:
    - Why is displacement specifically wrong vs. any involuntary relocation?
    - How to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate displacement?
  - Occupancy rights need more precise operationalization

**4.4 Challenges and Limits**
- **Operationalization**: When does occupancy begin generating rights? How much attachment is required?
  - Wells 2019: Minimum 3 years for lease-like rights
  - But: Is this too short for deep attachment? Too long for mobile populations?
- **Newcomer exclusion**: Strong occupancy rights risk entrenching segregation
  - Anderson 2010: Integration may require overriding incumbent preferences
  - Kogelmann 2025: Autonomy arguments used both for anti-gentrification AND for exclusionary zoning
  - Tension between protecting established communities and enabling access
- **Scale questions**: Do occupancy principles apply differently at individual vs. community level?

**Key Insight**: Occupancy theory provides framework for understanding why temporal duration matters - it's proxy for depth of place-based life projects. But reconciling incumbent protection with newcomer access remains unresolved.

**Transition**: Occupancy theory provides normative framework, but what empirical basis shows location truly matters economically?

## Section 5: The Economics of Located Goods: Agglomeration, Lock-in, and Spatial Injustice
**Word Target**: 850-1000 words
**Key Papers**: Moretti 2011/2012, Combes & Gobillon 2015, Hsieh & Moretti 2019, Glaeser & Gyourko 2018, Saiz 2010, Gyourko & Molloy 2015, Ganong & Shoag 2017, Baum-Snow 2007, Fischel 2001, Albouy 2016, Couture et al. 2019

**Content**:

**5.1 Agglomeration Economics: Why Location is Not Fungible**
- **Three mechanisms** (Duranton & Puga 2004, Combes & Gobillon 2015):
  - Sharing: Indivisible facilities, gains from variety, risk pooling
  - Matching: Improved match quality, faster matching in thick labor markets
  - Learning: Knowledge generation, diffusion, accumulation through face-to-face contact
- **Empirical magnitudes**: Doubling city size increases productivity 2-5% (Combes & Gobillon 2015)
  - Effect highly localized: benefits decay within 1-5 miles (Rosenthal & Strange 2004)
  - Stronger for high-skilled workers and knowledge-intensive industries
- **General equilibrium** (Moretti 2011): Productivity differences manifest as wage OR housing cost differences depending on supply elasticity
  - High-tech job creates 5 additional local service jobs (multiplier effects)
  - Low-skilled workers benefit from proximity to high-skilled
  - Agglomeration benefits flow broadly, not just to highly-educated
- **Land value concentration** (Albouy & Shin 2018):
  - Five metro areas (NY, LA, SF, DC, Boston) hold 48% of all US urban land value
  - Total urban land value > 2x GDP
  - Primarily reflects productivity differences, not just amenities (Albouy 2016)

**Normative implication**: Location-specific value is real, substantial ($2+ trillion), and created largely through agglomeration externalities and public investment. This raises questions about who should capture this value.

**5.2 Housing Supply Constraints and Spatial Misallocation**
- **Sources of inelasticity**:
  - Geographic constraints: Mountains, water, developable land (Saiz 2010)
  - Regulatory constraints: Zoning, permitting delays, density limits (Gyourko et al. 2008, Gyourko & Molloy 2015)
  - Political economy: Homevoters protect property values (Fischel 2001)
- **Consequences** (Glaeser & Gyourko 2018):
  - Inelastic markets: 29% price growth vs. 3.4% in elastic markets for same demand shock
  - If all metros were median-elastic: 15 million additional housing units
  - Employment growth 20%+ lower in constrained cities (Saks 2008)
- **Aggregate costs** (Hsieh & Moretti 2019): ***THE KEY FINDING***
  - Housing constraints in NYC, SF, San Jose reduced US GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009
  - Mechanism: High housing costs prevented workers from accessing productive cities
  - Removing constraints in just 3 cities would raise GDP 8.9%
  - First-order effect on national welfare, not marginal

**Normative implication**: Exclusionary housing policies don't just redistribute opportunity - they destroy it. This is not Pareto-optimal local control but efficiency-undermining exclusion.

**5.3 Path Dependency and Spatial Lock-In**
- **Infrastructure lock-in** (Baum-Snow 2007):
  - Each highway ray through central city reduced population ~18%
  - Interstate system decisions from 1950s-70s created suburban development that persists
  - Can't easily reverse - highways are sunk costs, suburban investment committed
- **Regulatory path dependency** (Gyourko & Molloy 2015):
  - Regulation correlates with coastal location, high prices, educated populations
  - Once enacted, regulation persists and often strengthens (ratchet effect)
  - Even sunbelt cities now adopting restrictive regulations - "suburban frontier closing"
- **Regional divergence** (Ganong & Shoag 2017):
  - US states experienced steady income convergence 1880-1980 (poor states catching up)
  - Convergence stopped after 1980
  - Mechanism: Land-use restrictions in high-income states raised housing costs
  - Attorneys can still afford to move (housing 21% of income) but janitors cannot (rent 52%)
  - Housing costs now prevent low-income workers from accessing high-wage regions
- **Trade shocks and immobility** (Autor et al. 2013):
  - Chinese import competition caused persistent unemployment in manufacturing regions
  - Workers unable to relocate to growing cities (housing costs, ties to place)
  - Spatial lock-in: trapped between disappearing opportunities and inaccessible growing regions

**Normative implications**:
1. Past decisions (highway routes, initial zoning) create structural constraints on just allocation
2. These effects persist for generations - not easily reversed
3. Creates temporal injustice: current generation inherits spatial configuration limiting their choices
4. Raises question: Do we have obligations to correct inherited spatial lock-in even without direct historical wrongdoing?

**5.4 Gentrification and Spatial Sorting**
- **Income-based sorting** (Couture et al. 2019):
  - 10% metro income increase → 13% increase in affluent downtown residents
  - Rising incomes explain ~50% of rich urbanization and poor suburbanization
  - Poor households displaced or pay higher rents for amenities they value less
- **Displacement evidence** - nuanced picture:
  - Ellen & O'Regan 2011 (1990s homeowners): No heightened displacement, original residents reported improved satisfaction
  - Dragan et al. 2020 (2009-2015 NYC Medicaid children): No increased mobility, environmental improvements for stayers
  - But: Studies focus on very low-income (Medicaid) or homeowners; may miss working-class renter displacement
  - Renters vs. owners, 1990s vs. 2010s-2020s may show different patterns

**Key Insight**: Economics establishes three crucial points for normative theory:
1. Location-specific value is real and enormous (agglomeration effects, land values)
2. This value is largely socially created (externalities, public investment), not individual production
3. Current allocation mechanisms (housing markets + exclusionary regulation) prevent efficient access and entrench inequality

**Transition**: How does housing justice literature address these empirical realities?

## Section 6: Housing Justice and the Gentrification Debate
**Word Target**: 800-1000 words
**Key Papers**: Desmond 2016, Harvey 2008, Fainstein 2010, Anderson 2010, Wells 2016/2019, Essert 2016, Madden & Marcuse 2016, Lloyd 2023, Draper 2024, Lopez-Cantero 2025, Slater 2006, Lees et al. 2008, Dummer & Neuhäuser 2025, Aalbers 2016, Young 2011, Kogelmann 2025, Erck 2024

**Content**:

**6.1 Right to Housing Frameworks**
- **Waldron 1991, Essert 2016**: Homelessness as property/freedom problem
  - Not just resource deficit but lack of space under exclusive control
  - Everything must be done somewhere - homeless lack freedom to perform basic life activities
  - Solution requires conferring property rights, not just shelter provision
- **Wells 2016, 2019**: Limited property rights for housing
  - Basic justice requires "lease rights" over self-contained space for minimum 3 years
  - Right to live alone (not forced communal housing) when resources permit
  - More limited than full ownership (lacks perpetuity, alienation) but provides security
- **Radin 1982**: Personhood theory
  - Homes are "personal property" bound up with identity and self-development
  - Deserve stronger protection than fungible property
  - Long-term residence makes housing constitutive of personhood
- **Dummer & Neuhäuser 2025**: Refined capability approach
  - Nussbaum's sufficientarian capabilities inadequate - housing has positional/relational dimensions
  - Segregation by income/race affects capabilities even when absolute housing quality meets thresholds
  - Self-respect depends on comparative status and social bases

**Synthesis**: Multiple frameworks (freedom, capabilities, personhood) converge on housing deserving special protection. Question: Do these support incumbent protection or newcomer access (or both)?

**6.2 Structural Injustice Frameworks**
- **Young 2011**: Social connection model of responsibility
  - Uses Sandy (single mother facing homelessness from condo conversion) as paradigm
  - Structural injustice: social processes systematically threaten groups with domination/deprivation
  - Responsibility is collective and forward-looking (remedy injustice), not individual blame
- **Shelby 2016**: Dark ghettos as structural injustice
  - Segregation violates reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, civic equality
  - Problem is basic structure (discrimination, wealth inequality), not ghetto residents
  - Requires systemic reform, not just ghetto interventions
- **Anderson 2010**: Integration imperative
  - Residential segregation is fundamental cause of persistent racial disadvantage
  - Creates tension: integration priority may conflict with incumbent community protection
  - Raises question: When does protecting established communities entrench unjust segregation?

**Synthesis**: Structural approaches shift focus from individual rights/claims to systemic patterns and institutional design. But risks underspecifying what individuals are owed.

**6.3 Political Economy Critiques**
- **Harvey 2008**: Marxist "right to the city"
  - Not just access to resources but collective right to reshape urbanization
  - Gentrification as class phenomenon - extracting surplus from working class
  - Critique: Liberal rights approaches treat symptoms (unequal housing) not causes (commodification, property rights)
- **Madden & Marcuse 2016**: Housing crisis rooted in commodification and financialization
  - Hypercommodification: luxury real estate and displacement as two sides of same process
  - Decommodification required, not just affordability programs
- **Aalbers 2016**: Financialization as structural transformation
  - Housing becomes "High-Quality Collateral" for global capital
  - State actively creates conditions for financial actors to dominate housing provision
  - Housing crisis is feature of financialized capitalism, not policy failure
- **Erck 2024**: Limitarianism - excessive housing ownership is wrong
  - Upper bound needed (housing wealth ceilings) to complement lower bound (right to housing)
  - Multiple-property ownership contributes to scarcity

**Synthesis**: Political economy frameworks identify capitalism and commodification as root causes. But may not provide specific principles for allocation under current conditions.

**6.4 Gentrification's Wrongs - Multiple Dimensions**
- **Physical displacement**: Most obvious harm
  - Van Leeuwen 2025: But autonomy accounts face challenge - why is displacement specifically wrong?
  - Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024: Violates three place-based rights simultaneously
- **Phenomenological displacement** (Lopez-Cantero 2025):
  - Non-material harm: erosion of belonging and at-homeness even without physical removal
  - Symbolic displacement when neighborhood transforms
  - Can't be remedied by compensation - loss of social world
- **Democratic harms** (Draper 2024):
  - Community disintegration: loss of networks and shared spaces for political discussion
  - Homogenization: economic/cultural change reduces diversity and informal public sphere access
  - Everyday democracy undermined even without displacement
- **Community goods loss** (Lloyd 2023):
  - Lockean argument: Incumbent land users labored together to create valuable community objects
  - Spheres of justice (Walzer): Community goods as separate sphere deserving protection from market
  - Collective creation grounds claims beyond individual autonomy

**Synthesis**: Gentrification's wrongfulness is multidimensional - autonomy violation, material harm, democratic deficit, community dissolution. Simple compensation cannot remedy all dimensions.

**6.5 The Integration vs. Community Stability Tension**
- **Anderson 2010**: Integration priority
  - Segregation perpetuates inequality across all dimensions (education, employment, wealth, health, political power)
  - Integration is moral and democratic imperative
  - May require overriding incumbent preferences that maintain segregation
- **Place-protection theorists** (Huber & Wolkenstein, Lloyd, Krishnamurthy & Moore):
  - Occupancy rights, community goods, located life plans deserve protection
  - Displacement wrongs incumbent residents
  - Risk: Strong incumbent protection entrenches segregation
- **Kogelmann 2025**: Autonomy arguments cut both ways
  - Anti-gentrification: displacement violates residents' autonomy
  - Pro-zoning: homeowners' control over property/neighborhood
  - Shows tension: same normative principle (autonomy) yields opposed policy conclusions
  - Suggests autonomy insufficient as sole framework

**Key Unresolved Question**: How to balance incumbent community protection against integration imperative and newcomer access? No consensus framework.

**6.6 Empirical Evidence on Displacement**
- **Lees et al. 2008, Slater 2006**: Critical gentrification studies
  - Documents displacement and challenges benign narratives
  - Slater: "Eviction of critical perspectives" from gentrification research
- **Ellen & O'Regan 2011**: 1990s homeowners - limited displacement, improvements for stayers
- **Dragan et al. 2020**: NYC 2009-2015 Medicaid children - no increased mobility, environmental gains
- **Interpretation challenges**:
  - Different populations (homeowners vs. renters), time periods (1990s vs. 2010s), cities (NYC rent regulation)
  - Measuring displacement is methodologically difficult (tracking people who leave)
  - Aggregate neighborhood improvements don't tell us about distributional fairness

**Transition**: Multiple theoretical frameworks, empirical complications, unresolved tensions. What research gaps remain?

## Section 7: Research Gaps and Future Directions
**Word Target**: 800-1000 words

**Introduction**: This review has surveyed diverse theoretical frameworks (distributive justice, temporal justice, occupancy rights, property theory) and empirical foundations (agglomeration economics, supply constraints, path dependency) addressing temporal claims to located goods. Despite rich literature, significant gaps remain.

**GAP 1: Operationalizing Temporal Thresholds**
- **Problem**: Occupancy theory says temporal residence generates rights, but when/how much?
  - Stilz: Established through "residence and participation in ongoing practices" - but how long?
  - Wells 2019: Minimum 3 years for lease rights - but is this sufficient for deep attachment?
  - No systematic account of how rights accumulate over time
- **Research need**:
  - Develop account of incremental rights accumulation based on temporal duration
  - Integrate psychological research on place attachment formation
  - Specify thresholds for different types of claims (security, participation, anti-displacement)
- **Methodological approach**: Combine normative theorizing with empirical place attachment research

**GAP 2: Reconciling Incumbent Protection and Newcomer Access**
- **Problem**: Theoretical stalemate
  - Occupancy rights theorists emphasize incumbent claims
  - Integration advocates (Anderson) and cosmopolitans prioritize access
  - No principled framework for adjudicating between them
- **Kogelmann 2025 observation**: Same normative principle (autonomy) yields opposed conclusions
- **Research need**:
  - Develop priority rules for when incumbent claims override access vs. vice versa
  - Specify what "changed circumstances" supersede vs. preserve incumbent claims (Meyer & Waligore framework)
  - Address whether there's asymmetry: stronger claims for some neighborhoods (e.g., historically displaced communities) vs. others (e.g., recent exclusionary suburbs)?
- **Possible approach**: Pluralistic framework recognizing different types of neighborhoods with different balances

**GAP 3: Who Should Capture Agglomeration Rents?**
- **Problem**: Economics shows urban land values are largely socially created (agglomeration externalities, public investment)
  - Albouy: $2+ trillion in land value, >2x GDP
  - Moretti: 5x multiplier effects, productivity broadly shared
  - But value captured by property owners, not workers who create it or public that invested
- **Normative question**: If value is socially created, who deserves to capture it?
  - Current residents (reward for being there first)?
  - All residents (because created collectively)?
  - National population (public infrastructure, equal opportunity)?
  - Future generations (intergenerational trust)?
- **Research need**: Normative framework for distributing socially-created location value
  - Consider land value taxation, community land trusts, other mechanisms
  - Connect to supersession debate (does past occupancy ground claims to future appreciation?)

**GAP 4: Temporal Justice and Path Dependency**
- **Problem**: Path dependency creates structural constraints without clear historical injustice
  - Baum-Snow: Highway routes from 1950s created suburban development persisting today
  - Ganong & Shoag: Regulation enacted decades ago prevents current mobility
  - Fischel: Homevoter dynamics create self-reinforcing exclusion
- **Normative question**: What obligations exist to correct inherited spatial lock-in?
  - If current generation didn't create constraints but inherits them, who bears responsibility?
  - Does path dependency create obligations even without historical wrongdoing claims?
  - How does this relate to supersession debate?
- **Research need**:
  - Develop framework for "structural historical obligations" distinct from direct wrongdoing
  - Specify when path dependency creates rectification duties
  - Address intergenerational justice dimension

**GAP 5: Renters' Property Rights and Temporal Accumulation**
- **Problem**: Property theory largely focuses on ownership; rental housing undertheorized
  - Honoré's bundle-of-rights shows property is disaggregatable
  - Wells proposes lease-like rights, but limited development
  - Question: Do long-term renters acquire additional property incidents over time?
- **Research need**:
  - Systematic account of how temporal occupancy by renters creates incremental property rights
  - Consider: Adverse possession as model (use over time can create ownership)
  - Harding 2019: Lockean spoilage proviso justifies squatting - does this extend to long-term renters?
  - Specify which incidents of ownership (Honoré) temporal renters might acquire
- **Practical implications**: Tenant protections, rent control, right to purchase, community land trusts

**GAP 6: Scale and Subsidiarity in Housing Governance**
- **Problem**: Appropriate level for housing decisions unclear
  - Fischel: Local control produces exclusion via homevoter dynamics
  - Hsieh & Moretti: Local restrictions create national GDP loss (36%)
  - Nine 2025: Foundational territories can be transnational, overlapping
  - But: Community self-determination and occupancy suggest local control
- **Research need**:
  - Normative framework for which housing decisions belong at which governmental level
  - Distinguish: Building standards (local?), affordability mandates (regional?), fair housing (national?)
  - Consider overlapping jurisdictions (Nine's model) vs. hierarchical authority
- **Methodological note**: Empirical federalism research combined with normative political philosophy

**GAP 7: Supersession Criteria for Urban Change**
- **Problem**: Meyer & Waligore 2022 sophisticate supersession debate but don't specify criteria
  - What counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances" in housing contexts?
  - Partial vs. full supersession in gentrification?
  - Dormant vs. final supersession?
- **Research need**:
  - Apply Meyer & Waligore framework specifically to housing and urban change
  - Develop criteria for when neighborhood transformation supersedes incumbent claims
  - Consider asymmetry: displacement from historically oppressed communities different from displacement from exclusionary suburbs?
  - Temporal dimension: Does supersession clock start immediately or only after sufficient time?
- **Case studies**: Apply to specific gentrification cases to test criteria

**GAP 8: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Work**
- **Problem**: Limited dialogue between philosophy and urban economics/geography
  - Philosophers often lack empirical grounding (magnitudes, mechanisms)
  - Economists rarely engage normative questions (who should benefit from agglomeration?)
  - Exception: Hsieh & Moretti provide empirical foundation for normative debates
- **Research need**:
  - More collaborations between philosophers and urban economists
  - Empirical testing of normative intuitions (do temporal thresholds match psychological attachment patterns?)
  - Normative analysis of economic findings (fairness of spatial misallocation, rent capitalization)
- **Opportunity**: Housing provides paradigm case for empirically-informed normative theory

**GAP 9: Displacement Measurement and Normative Significance**
- **Problem**: Empirical displacement evidence is contested
  - Ellen & O'Regan, Dragan et al. find limited displacement and environmental improvements
  - Critical scholars (Lees, Slater) argue displacement is real but hard to measure
  - Methodological challenge: tracking people who leave
- **Normative question**: Does displacement measurement settle moral questions?
  - If original residents benefit from gentrification (Dragan et al.), does that make it just?
  - Or are there non-displacement harms (Lopez-Cantero's phenomenological displacement, Draper's democratic harms)?
  - What if improvements are unequally distributed?
- **Research need**:
  - Clarify relationship between empirical displacement findings and normative assessment
  - Specify what empirical evidence would/wouldn't settle normative questions
  - Develop metrics for distribution of gentrification benefits/burdens

**GAP 10: Climate Migration and Housing Justice**
- **Problem**: Climate change creates new urgency for temporal housing claims
  - Stilz 2024: Climate displacement threatens occupancy rights
  - Ganong & Shoag: Housing costs already prevent mobility
  - Climate refugees will need housing in productive, safe cities
- **Research need**:
  - Integrate climate justice with housing justice literature
  - Apply temporal justice frameworks to climate displacement (supersession, occupancy, property)
  - Address tension: climate refugees' urgent access needs vs. incumbent residents' occupancy claims
  - Intergenerational dimension: future climate impact on housing allocation
- **Urgency**: Climate migration will intensify housing allocation conflicts in coming decades

**Conclusion of Gaps Section**: These ten gaps represent opportunities for advancing theoretical understanding and practical policy. Priority areas for immediate research:
1. Operationalizing temporal thresholds (Gaps 1, 5)
2. Reconciling competing claims (Gaps 2, 7)
3. Empirically-informed normative theory (Gaps 3, 8, 9)
4. Climate integration (Gap 10)

## Synthesis Writing Notes

**Citation Strategy**:
- Use as many of 126 papers as relevant while maintaining analytical flow
- Prioritize High importance papers, include Medium selectively, Low only when filling gaps
- Each section should cite 15-25 papers
- Total citations expected: 80-100 papers (out of 126 available)

**Analytical Emphasis**:
- Focus on debates and tensions, not just cataloguing positions
- Identify unresolved questions and genuine disagreements
- Connect across domains (e.g., economics empirics ground normative claims)
- Build argumentative arc toward research gaps

**Key Debates to Highlight**:
1. Fungible vs. located goods - can mainstream distributive justice adapt or need new frameworks?
2. Supersession - do historical claims persist or can be overridden by changed circumstances?
3. Incumbent vs. newcomer - how to adjudicate temporal priority vs. equal access?
4. Integration vs. community stability - when does protecting communities entrench injustice?
5. Individual rights vs. structural injustice - level of analysis for housing justice
6. Empirical displacement - what evidence shows and what it settles normatively

**Transitions Between Sections**:
- Each section should flow logically to next
- Use bridging paragraphs to maintain argumentative coherence
- Show how limitations of one framework motivate next framework

**Target Final Length**: 4500-5500 words total
**Target Research Gaps**: 10 specific gaps with clear research agendas
**Target Citations**: 80-100 of 126 validated papers
**Tone**: Publication-ready academic prose, analytical depth, balanced assessment of debates
