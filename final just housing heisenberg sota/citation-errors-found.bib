CITATION ERRORS FOUND DURING VALIDATION
VALIDATION_DATE: 2025-11-14
TOTAL_ERRORS: 3 entries
====================================================================

These entries contain citation errors discovered during validation.
All papers exist and are verifiable, but the BibTeX metadata is
incorrect in the listed domain files.

NOTE: These are NOT unverified sources - all papers are real and
published. The errors are metadata issues (wrong author names, wrong
publication type, wrong page numbers, etc.).

ACTIONS REQUIRED:
1. Domain 1: DELETE duplicate dummer2025housing entry
2. Domain 2: REPLACE bidadanure2021justice with correct book entry
3. Domain 2: UPDATE lippertrasmussen2025intergenerational metadata

DO NOT import this file to Zotero - make corrections to domain files instead.

  isbn = {9780198792185},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory of age-group justice combining complete life egalitarianism, lifespan prudence, and relational egalitarianism. Some inequalities between age groups matter independently of their diachronic impact - relational reasons for equality at each life stage. Distinguishes temporary age-group inequalities (acceptable if everyone experiences them across complete life) from generational inequalities (problematic when temporary inequalities become permanent for cohorts, as after 2008 recession). Temporal perspective essential: justice assessment requires both synchronic (moment-in-time) and diachronic (across lifespan) evaluation. RELEVANCE: Housing allocation has profound age-group dimensions. Young adults priced out of urban housing face both age-group inequality (synchronic) and potential generational inequality if they never recover access (diachronic). Elderly longtime residents facing displacement lose life-stage appropriate housing. Bidadanure's framework suggests housing justice must consider: (1) fair distribution across age groups at given time, (2) fair distribution across complete lives, (3) relational equality at each life stage. Temporal framing matters: policy benefiting young today may be prudent life-course investment, but systematic exclusion of cohort is unjust. The project should assess whether housing inequality between age groups reflects acceptable life-course variation or unjust generational stratification. POSITION: Age-group justice requires both complete-life diachronic equality and moment-in-time relational equality.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether relational egalitarianism can handle intergenerational justice given temporal non-overlap. Argument from Temporal Non-Overlap: if social relations are crucial for justice (relational egalitarianism), but we don't socially relate to non-overlapping future generations, then relational egalitarianism provides incomplete justice theory. Defends relational egalitarianism by arguing temporal non-overlap doesn't preclude relevant relationships. However, acknowledges tension: standard relational accounts emphasize reciprocal relationships, but future people can't reciprocate. Examines scope and time-frame of egalitarian justice. RELEVANCE: Displacement involves temporal non-overlap. Former residents no longer present in neighborhood don't overlap with current/future residents. Can relational justice framework handle their claims? If justice requires actual relationships, do displaced people lose claims once they leave? Or do past relationships create enduring obligations? Housing project faces this puzzle: gentrification disrupts actual relationships (people scatter), but claims seem to persist. Lippert-Rasmussen's analysis suggests need for justice theory that handles both: relational dimensions (actual communities) and non-relational dimensions (obligations to non-overlapping past/future residents). Temporal framing matters: should we assess housing justice at moment-in-time (who's currently here?) or across time (who was here, who will be here?). POSITION: Temporal non-overlap creates theoretical challenge for relational egalitarianism requiring modification to handle intergenerational justice.},
