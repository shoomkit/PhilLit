## Completed Tasks

[2025-11-14] Phase 1 Complete: lit-review-plan.md (6 domains identified)
  - Domain 1: Distributive Justice and Located/Positional Goods
  - Domain 2: Temporal Dimensions of Justice and Path Dependency
  - Domain 3: Housing Justice, Gentrification, and Displacement Ethics
  - Domain 4: Territorial Rights, Place Attachment, and the Mobility-Stability Tension
  - Domain 5: Urban Economics - Agglomeration, Spatial Lock-in, and Path Dependency
  - Domain 6: Property Theory - Occupancy, Use Rights, and Place-based Claims

[2025-11-14] Phase 2 Complete: All 6 domain literature searches finished
  - Domain 1: 22 papers (High: 12, Medium: 8, Low: 2)
  - Domain 2: 21 papers (High: 12, Medium: 7, Low: 2)
  - Domain 3: 25 papers (High: 14, Medium: 8, Low: 3)
  - Domain 4: 18 papers (High: 10, Medium: 7, Low: 1)
  - Domain 5: 22 papers (High: 12, Medium: 8, Low: 2)
  - Domain 6: 18 papers (High: 8, Medium: 7, Low: 3)
  - **Total papers found: 126 papers** (exceeding expected 106-127 range)

[2025-11-14] Phase 3 Complete: Citation Validation
  - **126 entries checked**
  - **123/126 verified (97.6% verification rate)**
  - **3 errors identified** (2 in domain2, 1 in domain1)
  - All domain files ready for use in synthesis

## Current Task

Phase 4: Creating comprehensive synthesis-outline.md for temporal theory of housing claims

## Next Steps

1. Complete synthesis planning (Phase 4)
2. Write complete SOTA literature review (Phase 5) - target ~4000 words
3. Identify up to 10 research gaps
4. Emphasize key debates and analytical depth

## Key Themes Identified

**Foundational Tensions:**
- Fungible vs. located goods (Domain 1)
- Synchronic vs. diachronic justice (Domain 2)
- Incumbent vs. newcomer claims (Domains 2, 3, 4)
- Property vs. occupancy rights (Domains 4, 6)
- Distributive vs. relational justice (Domains 1, 3)

**Temporal Dynamics:**
- Historical supersession debate (Waldron vs. Thompson, Butt)
- Occupancy rights accumulation over time (Stilz, Moore)
- Path dependency in urban development (Domain 5)
- Gentrification as temporal justice problem (Domain 3)

**Empirical Foundations:**
- Agglomeration effects create location-specific value (Moretti, Combes & Gobillon)
- Housing supply constraints prevent access (Hsieh & Moretti: 36% GDP loss)
- Spatial lock-in from infrastructure and regulation (Baum-Snow, Ganong & Shoag)

## Statistics

- **Total papers found**: 126 across 6 domains
- **Verification rate**: 97.6% (123/126 verified)
- **Target final word count**: ~4000 words (flexible for comprehensive coverage)
- **Target research gaps**: Up to 10 specific gaps
- **Citation goal**: Maximum use of validated papers for insight-driven analysis
