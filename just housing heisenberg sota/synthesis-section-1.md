## Section 1: Introduction - The Temporal Puzzle of Housing as a Located Good

Housing is fundamentally different from the fungible goods assumed by standard theories of distributive justice. Unlike income that can be redistributed or personal property that can be moved, housing value is inseparable from location. This insight, developed by Fred Hirsch's (1976) analysis of "positional goods," reveals a crucial feature of spatial resources: they cannot simply be expanded to meet demand. A good school, safe neighborhood, or proximity to employment opportunities exists in a specific place—if everyone could access the best locations, those locations would lose their value. Urban economics confirms this intuition with striking empirical magnitudes: agglomeration economies create wage premiums of 10-30% in productive cities (Combes and Gobillon 2015), while five metropolitan areas alone—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Boston—hold 48% of all US urban land value, exceeding $2 trillion (Albouy and Shin 2018). These are not marginal differences but fundamental economic realities that shape life opportunities.

This non-fungibility creates a distinctive justice problem when temporal claims conflict. Consider the competing claims that arise in gentrifying neighborhoods: longtime residents assert rights based on past occupancy, place attachment accumulated through years of residence, investment in community institutions, and life plans built around specific spatial arrangements (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018). Newcomers counter with claims based on current housing need, equal access to opportunity-rich locations, and rights to non-discriminatory housing allocation. Future generations assert claims to housing in productive cities where employment and opportunity concentrate. Each claim appears prima facie legitimate, yet not all can be satisfied given spatial scarcity. Standard distributive justice frameworks struggle to adjudicate among these temporally-structured claims.

The theoretical challenge runs deep. Rawlsian distributive justice treats primary goods as all-purpose means that can be redistributed across society (Rawls 1971), but this framework assumes goods are fungible—location-neutral resources that any rational person values regardless of life plan. Housing defies this assumption. One cannot simply transfer "good location" from San Francisco to Detroit; the value is intrinsically tied to place. Property theory focuses on ownership rights and legitimate acquisition (Locke 1988, Nozick 1974), but this misses occupancy-based claims of renters who constitute the majority in many urban areas yet lack ownership. Historical justice theories address past wrongs and rectification (Waldron 1992, Thompson 2002, Butt 2009), but leave unresolved how long historical claims persist and when changed circumstances might supersede them. Should historical displacement from a neighborhood create permanent claims, or do demographic transformation and economic development eventually override such claims?

The empirical stakes are not marginal. Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) landmark study demonstrates that housing supply constraints in just three cities—New York, San Francisco, and San Jose—reduced US GDP growth by 36% between 1964 and 2009. The mechanism is straightforward but devastating: exclusionary zoning and land use regulations raised housing costs in high-productivity cities, preventing workers from migrating to where they would be more productive. This is not merely an efficiency loss; it is a justice issue affecting who can access location-specific opportunities. Regional income convergence—the process by which poor states caught up to rich states from 1880-1980—halted after 1980 precisely because housing costs in high-income states created barriers preventing low-skilled workers from migrating to opportunity (Ganong and Shoag 2017). Attorneys can still afford to move to expensive coastal cities where housing costs 21% of their income, but janitors cannot when rent consumes 52% of earnings.

This review organizes the literature around three key debates that structure contemporary scholarship. First, the autonomy versus derivative status of spatial justice: must we develop distinctive principles for located goods, or can mainstream distributive frameworks (Rawls, Dworkin, Sen) be extended to accommodate spatial concerns? Proponents of autonomous spatial justice (Soja 2010, Harvey 1973) argue geography itself produces inequality requiring independent normative analysis, while critics contend spatial justice merely applies general principles to geographic contexts (Moroni 2020). Second, the supersession debate: do historical injustices create persistent obligations that survive changing circumstances, or can demographic shifts and economic transformation morally supersede earlier claims? Waldron's (1992) supersession thesis has sparked decades of debate, with recent work by Meyer and Waligore (2022) and Truccone (2024) developing sophisticated frameworks for when and how supersession might apply. Third, the incumbent versus newcomer tension: how should we balance occupancy-based rights protecting established residents (Stilz 2009, 2013, 2019; Moore 2015; Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) against access rights enabling newcomers to pursue opportunities in productive cities (Anderson 2010)?

These debates are not merely academic. Housing policy must navigate the temporal dimension of place-based claims: who has legitimate expectations to remain in a neighborhood? What duties do communities have to accommodate newcomers? How should we weigh past investment against current need and future opportunity? This review establishes that temporal claims to located goods require distinctive theoretical treatment, not merely application of existing distributive frameworks. The non-fungibility of location, the path dependency of urban spatial configurations, and the empirical magnitude of exclusion's costs together demand normative analysis that takes time, place, and the persistence of historical arrangements seriously.
