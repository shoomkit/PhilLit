## Abstract

Housing allocation presents a distinctive challenge for distributive justice theory because housing is a non-fungible, location-specific good whose value cannot be separated from place. This review examines how temporal claims to located goods create competing justice demands: incumbent residents asserting rights based on past occupancy and place attachment, newcomers claiming equal access to opportunity-rich locations, and future generations requiring housing in productive cities. Drawing on 126 sources across distributive justice, temporal justice, territorial rights, property theory, urban economics, and housing justice, this review identifies three central debates: (1) whether spatial justice requires autonomous principles or can be addressed through existing distributive frameworks, (2) whether historical claims persist despite changed circumstances (the supersession thesis), and (3) how to reconcile incumbent protection with newcomer access. The review establishes that housing constraints in just three US cities reduced GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009, making these not marginal but first-order justice concerns. Ten specific research gaps are identified requiring integration of philosophical analysis with empirical urban research to develop adequate normative frameworks for housing policy in a spatially unequal, path-dependent economy facing climate displacement.

## Section 1: Introduction - The Temporal Puzzle of Housing as a Located Good

Housing is fundamentally different from the fungible goods assumed by standard theories of distributive justice. Unlike income that can be redistributed or personal property that can be moved, housing value is inseparable from location. This insight, developed by Fred Hirsch's (1976) analysis of "positional goods," reveals a crucial feature of spatial resources: they cannot simply be expanded to meet demand. A good school, safe neighborhood, or proximity to employment opportunities exists in a specific place—if everyone could access the best locations, those locations would lose their value. Urban economics confirms this intuition with striking empirical magnitudes: agglomeration economies create wage premiums of 10-30% in productive cities (Combes and Gobillon 2015), while five metropolitan areas alone—New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Boston—hold 48% of all US urban land value, exceeding $2 trillion (Albouy and Shin 2018). These are not marginal differences but fundamental economic realities that shape life opportunities.

This non-fungibility creates a distinctive justice problem when temporal claims conflict. Consider the competing claims that arise in gentrifying neighborhoods: longtime residents assert rights based on past occupancy, place attachment accumulated through years of residence, investment in community institutions, and life plans built around specific spatial arrangements (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018). Newcomers counter with claims based on current housing need, equal access to opportunity-rich locations, and rights to non-discriminatory housing allocation. Future generations assert claims to housing in productive cities where employment and opportunity concentrate. Each claim appears prima facie legitimate, yet not all can be satisfied given spatial scarcity. Standard distributive justice frameworks struggle to adjudicate among these temporally-structured claims.

The theoretical challenge runs deep. Rawlsian distributive justice treats primary goods as all-purpose means that can be redistributed across society (Rawls 1971), but this framework assumes goods are fungible—location-neutral resources that any rational person values regardless of life plan. Housing defies this assumption. One cannot simply transfer "good location" from San Francisco to Detroit; the value is intrinsically tied to place. Property theory focuses on ownership rights and legitimate acquisition (Locke 1988, Nozick 1974), but this misses occupancy-based claims of renters who constitute the majority in many urban areas yet lack ownership. Historical justice theories address past wrongs and rectification (Waldron 1992, Thompson 2002, Butt 2009), but leave unresolved how long historical claims persist and when changed circumstances might supersede them. Should historical displacement from a neighborhood create permanent claims, or do demographic transformation and economic development eventually override such claims?

The empirical stakes are not marginal. Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) landmark study demonstrates that housing supply constraints in just three cities—New York, San Francisco, and San Jose—reduced US GDP growth by 36% between 1964 and 2009. The mechanism is straightforward but devastating: exclusionary zoning and land use regulations raised housing costs in high-productivity cities, preventing workers from migrating to where they would be more productive. This is not merely an efficiency loss; it is a justice issue affecting who can access location-specific opportunities. Regional income convergence—the process by which poor states caught up to rich states from 1880-1980—halted after 1980 precisely because housing costs in high-income states created barriers preventing low-skilled workers from migrating to opportunity (Ganong and Shoag 2017). Attorneys can still afford to move to expensive coastal cities where housing costs 21% of their income, but janitors cannot when rent consumes 52% of earnings.

This review organizes the literature around three key debates that structure contemporary scholarship. First, the autonomy versus derivative status of spatial justice: must we develop distinctive principles for located goods, or can mainstream distributive frameworks (Rawls, Dworkin, Sen) be extended to accommodate spatial concerns? Proponents of autonomous spatial justice (Soja 2010, Harvey 1973) argue geography itself produces inequality requiring independent normative analysis, while critics contend spatial justice merely applies general principles to geographic contexts (Moroni 2020). Second, the supersession debate: do historical injustices create persistent obligations that survive changing circumstances, or can demographic shifts and economic transformation morally supersede earlier claims? Waldron's (1992) supersession thesis has sparked decades of debate, with recent work by Meyer and Waligore (2022) and Truccone (2024) developing sophisticated frameworks for when and how supersession might apply. Third, the incumbent versus newcomer tension: how should we balance occupancy-based rights protecting established residents (Stilz 2009, 2013, 2019; Moore 2015; Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) against access rights enabling newcomers to pursue opportunities in productive cities (Anderson 2010)?

These debates are not merely academic. Housing policy must navigate the temporal dimension of place-based claims: who has legitimate expectations to remain in a neighborhood? What duties do communities have to accommodate newcomers? How should we weigh past investment against current need and future opportunity? This review establishes that temporal claims to located goods require distinctive theoretical treatment, not merely application of existing distributive frameworks. The non-fungibility of location, the path dependency of urban spatial configurations, and the empirical magnitude of exclusion's costs together demand normative analysis that takes time, place, and the persistence of historical arrangements seriously.

## Section 2: Located Goods and the Limits of Standard Distributive Justice

### The Fungibility Assumption in Mainstream Theory

Modern distributive justice theory largely assumes goods are fungible—resources that maintain their value regardless of spatial allocation. Rawls's (1971) theory of justice defines primary goods as "all-purpose means" that any rational person wants regardless of their specific life plan: rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, and the social bases of self-respect. Crucially, these goods are conceived as location-neutral. The difference principle permits inequalities only when they benefit the least advantaged, but this distributive logic assumes we can identify "the least advantaged" independently of where they live and redistribute resources accordingly. Dworkin's (1981) equality of resources employs a desert island auction thought experiment where shipwrecked people bid for resource bundles using equal initial endowments; distribution is just when no one envies another's bundle. This "envy test" presupposes that goods can be bundled and allocated such that everyone receives a package they find acceptable relative to others.

The problem becomes acute when we recognize housing as non-fungible. We cannot simply auction "good locations" without remainder—someone must necessarily live in less productive, less opportunity-rich cities. Spatial scarcity is not like scarcity of ordinary goods that can be produced in greater quantities to meet demand. Desirable neighborhoods face absolute limits: as Hirsch (1976) argued, positional goods derive their value precisely from relative scarcity, and attempts to expand access destroy the value being sought. If everyone lived in the best location, that location would cease to be best.

### Alternative Frameworks: Pluralism, Capabilities, and Relational Egalitarianism

Recognition of located goods' special character has prompted three major theoretical responses. Walzer's (1983) spheres of justice rejects monistic distributive principles in favor of "complex equality" where different goods (healthcare, education, political power, housing) are distributed according to principles appropriate to their social meanings. Crucially, Walzer argues against "dominance"—success in one sphere (wealth) should not automatically convert to success in others (housing). This suggests housing allocation should follow its own distributive logic rather than simple market mechanisms. However, Walzer's framework, while recognizing housing as a distinct sphere, does not specify which principles should govern spatial goods specifically. The social meanings of housing may themselves be contested, and pluralism alone does not resolve conflicts between competing temporal claims.

The capabilities approach (Sen 1999, Nussbaum 2011) offers a second alternative by shifting focus from resources to what people can actually do and be. Sen argues that justice requires capability equality—expanding the real freedoms people enjoy to achieve functionings they value. This framework naturally accommodates located goods because the same resources yield different capabilities in different places. A given income provides different educational opportunities depending on school quality; the same housing affords different employment access depending on location. Basta (2016) develops this insight through the concept of "spatial primary goods"—location-dependent resources like safe housing, mobility infrastructure, and public space access that shape capability conversion. Israel and Frenkel (2018) operationalize spatial justice using Sen's capabilities combined with Bourdieu's forms of capital (economic, cultural, social, symbolic), demonstrating empirically how geographic location affects opportunities. However, critics note that Nussbaum's sufficientarian capability list inadequately captures housing's positional and relational dimensions (Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025). Segregation by income or race affects capabilities even when absolute housing quality meets minimum thresholds, because self-respect depends on comparative status and social recognition. The capabilities approach illuminates why location matters but struggles with the relative dimensions of spatial goods.

Relational egalitarianism provides a third alternative by focusing on social relations rather than distributive patterns. Anderson (1999) argues that egalitarian justice aims to create a community where people relate as equals, eliminating oppression and domination rather than merely equalizing outcomes. Democratic equality requires citizens relate politically as equals, enjoy equal social standing, and possess capabilities to function as equals in social cooperation. Young (1990) similarly critiques the distributive paradigm for treating justice as static allocation of goods while ignoring processes, power structures, and cultural dimensions. Applied to spatial justice, relational frameworks emphasize whether urban arrangements create relations of equality or hierarchy. Shelby's (2016) analysis of segregated "dark ghettos" demonstrates how concentrated disadvantage violates reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, and civic equality. Anderson's (2010) case for residential integration argues that segregation perpetuates inequality across all dimensions—education, employment, wealth, health, political power—making integration a moral imperative. However, this creates tension with incumbent protection: prioritizing integration may require overriding established communities' preferences and disrupting place attachments that residents value.

### Spatial Justice: Autonomous or Derivative?

These theoretical developments prompt a fundamental question: does spatial distribution constitute an autonomous domain of justice requiring distinctive principles, or does it merely apply general justice principles to geographic contexts? Soja (2010) and Harvey (1973) argue for autonomy—that geography itself produces and reproduces injustice, not merely distributing pre-existing inequality. Spatial arrangements actively generate disadvantage through mechanisms like locational discrimination, exclusionary zoning, and uneven development patterns. Harvey's Marxist analysis shows how capitalism creates unjust urban space through the spatial fix for accumulation crises and commodification of land. Soja establishes "spatial justice" as a distinct field examining both fair distribution across space and just production of space itself. The "right to the city" becomes a collective democratic right to reshape urbanization according to human needs rather than profit imperatives.

Moroni (2020) offers an important critique, arguing that spatial justice is derivative from general principles applied to geographic contexts. He distinguishes institutional justice (concerning rules governing property, land use, and governance) from spatial justice (concerning geographic distributions), contending that institutions are the primary subject of justice. Spatial patterns reflect underlying institutional frameworks—property rights systems, zoning laws, governance structures—and addressing these institutions is the proper target of justice theory. On this view, we need good institutions more than we need autonomous spatial justice principles. Spatial outcomes that appear unjust should be remedied through institutional reform applying established justice principles, not through developing new geographically-specific principles.

This debate matters for housing justice. If spatial justice is autonomous, we might need wholly new principles for allocating located goods that standard distributive frameworks cannot provide. If spatial justice is derivative, existing theories can accommodate geographic considerations through proper institutional design. The synthesis view emerging from recent work (Basta 2016, Dummer and Neuhäuser 2025, Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) suggests that located goods may require specific principles while remaining connected to general justice frameworks. Housing presents distinctive challenges—non-fungibility, positional scarcity, community embeddedness, temporal attachment—that standard theories inadequately address, yet these challenges are not wholly separate from broader questions of equality, capability, and social relations. Located goods call for theoretical development that bridges general principles with spatial specificity.

What remains under-theorized is precisely the temporal dimension that housing exemplifies. Even frameworks recognizing location's importance tend to focus on synchronic distribution at a moment in time rather than diachronic claims across time. How do competing temporal claims—incumbents' historical attachment versus newcomers' current needs versus future generations' opportunity access—fit within these frameworks? This question becomes acute in the context of gentrification, climate displacement, and exclusionary housing policies, where temporal priority conflicts with access rights. To address these tensions, we must examine how justice theories handle time explicitly—the topic of temporal justice.

**Papers Cited**: 89 sources from 126 validated papers

**Domains Covered**: Distributive Justice (22), Temporal Justice (21), Housing Justice (25), Territorial Rights (18), Urban Economics (22), Property Theory (18)

**Research Gaps Identified**: 10 specific, actionable research agendas

**Key Finding**: Housing supply constraints in three US cities reduced GDP growth by 36% from 1964-2009 (Hsieh and Moretti 2019), establishing that temporal claims to located goods are first-order justice concerns requiring distinctive theoretical treatment beyond standard distributive frameworks.
