====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The territorial rights literature asks what justifies a state's (or other political entity's) jurisdiction over a particular geographical territory. Recent scholarship has moved beyond state-level analysis to examine sub-state territorial claims, including neighborhood-level occupancy rights in gentrification contexts. Major theoretical traditions include: (1) nationalist theories grounding rights in cultural nations' relationships with homelands (Miller, Meisels); (2) self-determination theories connecting territorial rights to peoples' capacity for self-governance and occupancy (Moore, Stilz); (3) place-based or "river model" theories emphasizing ecological features and dense social relationships (Nine, Ochoa Espejo); and (4) associative ownership theories based on contributions to political institutions (Pevnick). A parallel literature on the philosophy of place (Malpas, Casey) provides phenomenological foundations for understanding the normative significance of place attachment, arguing that human being is inextricably bound to place and that this attachment grounds moral claims.

The mobility-stability tension emerges in debates about migration rights versus rights to remain in place. Cosmopolitan theorists (Benhabib) emphasize universal hospitality and porous borders, while communitarians stress the moral significance of rootedness and local attachments. Recent work has applied territorial rights frameworks to urban gentrification, arguing that residents have occupancy rights against displacement (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024). Climate displacement raises urgent questions about whether territorial rights include rights to remain when environmental change threatens habitability (Stilz 2024).

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is directly relevant to housing justice and temporal claims research because it addresses whether long-term residence generates moral claims to remain in a place. If occupancy theory is correct that people develop place-based life projects deserving protection, then temporal duration of residence becomes morally significant for housing policy. The literature provides sophisticated frameworks for thinking about neighborhood-level territorial claims, not just state-level borders. The tension between mobility (freedom to move) and stability (freedom to stay put) maps onto housing displacement debates where some emphasize economic mobility while others stress community rootedness and the right to stay put.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen an "urban turn" in territorial rights theory, with philosophers applying occupancy rights frameworks to gentrification and neighborhood change (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024, Draper 2024). Climate displacement has prompted new work on territorial justice when places become uninhabitable (Stilz 2024). A 2025 special issue in Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy advances "second wave" territorial rights theory engaging gentrification, Indigenous land rights, and foundational territories for resource management (Nine 2025). There is growing interest in place-based rights as distinct from property rights, with emphasis on how displacement harms autonomy by disrupting place-dependent life plans.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Most territorial rights theory focuses on state-level or Indigenous peoples' claims, with limited work on intermediate scales like cities and neighborhoods. Few theorists have operationalized "occupancy" or "attachment" in ways that guide policy. The relationship between temporal duration and strength of territorial claim remains under-theorized. Little work bridges phenomenological accounts of place (Malpas, Casey) with normative political theory, despite potential synergies. The tension between cosmopolitan mobility rights and localist stability rights needs more systematic treatment, especially regarding housing.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
Focus on Stilz's occupancy theory (2009, 2019, 2024) as the core philosophical framework, particularly her account of how place-based life projects ground territorial claims. Contrast self-determination theories (Moore, Stilz) with place-based "river model" approaches (Nine, Ochoa Espejo). The recent gentrification literature (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018, Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024) shows how territorial rights theory applies to housing, making it essential for the state-of-the-art review. Phenomenological work (Malpas, Casey) provides deeper grounding for why place matters morally but needs integration with normative theory. The mobility-stability tension (Kotef 2015, Benhabib 2006) frames a core dilemma for housing justice.

Defends spatially-defined political units but argues states' rights to control borders and natural resources are much more limited than commonly assumed. Occupancy rights are grounded in individuals' interests in security for central life commitments and being agent in charge of controlling/revising these commitments. RELEVANCE: Most systematic philosophical defense of occupancy-based territorial rights. Directly relevant to housing justice because it grounds territorial claims in place-based life projects and stable possession, concepts applicable to neighborhood-level claims. Her limited defense of border control and resource rights has implications for housing policy and local exclusion. Winner of multiple awards, widely debated in recent literature.

Just responses should prioritize mandatory global taxation for in situ adaptation, allowing people to remain in their territories. When relocation becomes inevitable, outlines principles for just relocation regimes. Loss suffered by displaced people cannot be fully redressed by migration to another place because occupancy rights are place-specific. RELEVANCE: Applies occupancy theory to contemporary crisis of climate-induced displacement, showing how place-based life projects create moral claims to remain. Directly relevant to housing justice and displacement debates—if climate change can generate duties to help people stay in place, this suggests framework for thinking about gentrification-induced displacement. Demonstrates occupancy rights are not merely property rights but protect autonomy through stable possession of specific places.

Argues gentrification wrongs residents by disrupting multiple forms of place attachment simultaneously. Previous accounts focusing only on displacement or economic harms miss full scope of place-related harms. RELEVANCE: Directly applies territorial rights and place attachment theory to urban housing context. Demonstrates how occupancy theory and self-determination frameworks extend to neighborhood level. Highly relevant to housing justice project because it articulates specific place-based rights violated by gentrification and grounds these in philosophical literature on territory.

Territorial rights must be universally justified since they affect everybody. Argues territorial rights arise from collective management of shared resource systems rather than national identity or state formation. Emphasizes interdependence and overlapping resource domains. Won American Philosophical Association Book Prize 2013. Critiques "desert island model" of discrete, bounded territories. RELEVANCE: Provides alternative to occupancy and self-determination theories by grounding territorial rights in resource management needs. Her emphasis on interdependence and overlapping domains applies to urban contexts where neighborhoods share infrastructure and resources. Challenges assumption that territorial units must be discrete and bounded, relevant to thinking about nested scales of territorial authority (city, neighborhood, region).

Grounds in robust interdependence of individuals and groups within spatially interconnected resource domains. Residents must collectively manage domains through novel jurisdictional units. Part of "river model" approach to territory. RELEVANCE: Extends territorial rights theory to sub-state and cross-border scales, directly relevant to urban/neighborhood governance. Shows how resource interdependence can ground territorial authority at multiple overlapping scales.

Defends moderate position between open borders cosmopolitanism and absolute sovereignty, arguing associative ties generate territorial rights but not unlimited rights. RELEVANCE: Offers contribution-based rather than occupancy-based account of territorial rights. Relevant to housing justice debates about longtime residents' claims—if contributions to community institutions ground territorial claims, then temporal duration matters as proxy for contribution.

RELEVANCE: Provides cosmopolitan corrective to nationalist and self-determination theories of territorial rights. Relevant to housing justice because it questions whether territorial rights at any scale can be absolute—local communities cannot claim unlimited territorial control if this violates broader justice requirements.

Territory emerges from local socio-natural relations and institutions where people perform place-specific duties. People don't own territory; rather territory emerges from relational networks. Emphasizes porosity, interdependence, and relationality. RELEVANCE: Radical reconceptualization of territorial rights moving from ownership to relationality. Highly relevant to urban contexts where neighborhoods are interdependent through infrastructure, economy, social networks.

Tension between cosmopolitanism and sovereignty can be mitigated through democratic iterations. RELEVANCE: Represents cosmopolitan challenge to territorial rights theories emphasizing boundedness and exclusion. Her emphasis on hospitality and porous borders contrasts with territorial theories defending border control. Relevant to housing justice mobility-stability tension—cosmopolitan view emphasizes freedom of movement while territorial theories emphasize right to remain.

Colonial regimes justified through rationality-stability series. RELEVANCE: Critical analysis of mobility-stability tension central to territorial rights and housing justice debates. Shows how liberal tradition simultaneously celebrates mobility as freedom and restricts it along exclusionary lines. Relevant to housing displacement debates where some emphasize economic mobility (moving for opportunities) while others stress right to stability (remaining in place).
