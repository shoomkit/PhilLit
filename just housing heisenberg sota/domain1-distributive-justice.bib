====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
Distributive justice concerns how benefits and burdens should be allocated
among members of society. The mainstream tradition from Rawls to Sen focuses
on abstract principles and fungible goods (primary goods, resources, capabilities).
However, spatially-embedded goods—housing, neighborhood amenities, access to
public services—pose distinctive challenges. These goods are non-fungible
(location matters), positional (relative standing matters), and relational
(connected to community and identity). Three key debates structure this domain:
(1) whether spatial distribution is derivative of general distributive principles
or requires independent analysis; (2) how positional and located goods affect
traditional equality principles; (3) whether relational approaches (Anderson,
Young) better capture spatial justice than resourcist frameworks (Rawls, Dworkin).

Recent work (2010-2025) has increasingly recognized that "spatial justice" is
not merely applied ethics but raises foundational questions about what goods
we distribute, to whom, and according to what principles. Key developments
include: the emergence of spatial justice as a distinct field (Soja 2010),
capabilities-based approaches to housing and place (Basta 2016, Dummer 2025),
and critiques of standard distributive frameworks for ignoring geography
(Shelby 2016, Dawkins 2021). The field bridges political philosophy, urban
planning, geography, and critical theory.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides essential theoretical frameworks for analyzing housing
justice and temporal claims. The distinction between fungible and located goods
is central to understanding why housing allocation differs from income
redistribution. Walzer's spheres of justice and Anderson's relational equality
offer alternatives to Rawlsian distributive frameworks that may better capture
the non-fungible, community-embedded nature of housing. Recent work on spatial
justice (Moroni 2020, Israel & Frenkel 2018) connects geographic distribution
to broader questions of equality of opportunity. The capabilities approach
(Sen, Nussbaum, Basta) provides tools for operationalizing housing justice
beyond simple resource allocation.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The last decade has seen substantial work connecting distributive justice to
spatial considerations. Key trends: (1) operationalization of spatial justice
in planning practice (2024); (2) housing-specific justice frameworks combining
capabilities and relational equality (Dummer 2025, Dawkins 2021); (3) critiques
of urban segregation as systemic injustice (Shelby 2016); (4) recognition that
geography itself produces inequality requiring normative analysis (Israel &
Frenkel 2018, Stilz 2019). The field has moved beyond viewing spatial justice
as merely applied distributive justice to recognizing place-based concerns as
raising distinctive philosophical questions.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited philosophical work explicitly theorizes the non-fungibility of located
goods and its implications for distributive principles. Few papers bridge
analytic political philosophy and critical geography traditions. Temporal
dimensions of housing claims (historical injustice, displacement, gentrification)
remain under-theorized in mainstream distributive justice. The relationship
between positional goods theory and spatial justice needs development. More
work needed on allocation mechanisms for scarce spatial resources beyond market
or bureaucratic distribution.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For synthesis, prioritize: (1) Foundational contrast between Rawlsian primary
goods and spatially-embedded goods (Rawls 1971, Walzer 1983, Basta 2016);
(2) Relational vs. distributive equality frameworks (Anderson 1999, Young 1990,
Scheffler 2003) as alternatives for spatial justice; (3) Recent work explicitly
on spatial/housing justice (Shelby 2016, Dawkins 2021, Dummer 2025, Moroni
2020, Soja 2010); (4) Positional goods and allocation mechanisms (Hirsch 1976,
Elster 1992). Key tension: Can standard distributive frameworks accommodate
located goods, or do we need distinctive "spatial justice" principles?

  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1971},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops justice as fairness with two principles: equal basic liberties and the difference principle allowing inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. Defines primary goods as all-purpose means (rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, self-respect) that any rational person wants regardless of life plan. Argues justice concerns the basic structure of society and fair distribution of these primary goods. RELEVANCE: Foundational framework for distributive justice but treats goods as fungible and location-neutral. The primary goods approach struggles with spatially-embedded goods like housing where location fundamentally affects value and cannot be redistributed like income. Our project examines whether Rawlsian framework can accommodate non-fungible, place-based goods or requires modification.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Rejects single universal principle of justice in favor of "complex equality" where different social goods (healthcare, education, political power, money) are distributed according to different principles appropriate to their social meanings. Argues against "dominance" where success in one sphere (e.g., wealth) converts to success in others. No good x should be distributed merely because one possesses good y. Different communities may interpret goods differently. RELEVANCE: Offers pluralist alternative to Rawlsian uniformity, directly relevant to housing as a distinct sphere with its own distributive logic. Walzer's recognition that some goods have meanings tied to community and cannot be reduced to abstract resources provides theoretical support for treating spatially-embedded goods distinctively. However, leaves open which principles govern housing/spatial goods specifically. POSITION: Pluralist justice, complex equality, communitarian social meanings, anti-dominance.},

Uses desert island auction thought experiment where shipwrecked people bid for resources using equal initial endowments; distribution is equal when no one envies another's bundle. Distinguishes option luck (risks deliberately taken) from brute luck (random misfortune), arguing equality requires compensating for brute luck disadvantages but not option luck. Resources not welfare should be equalized. RELEVANCE: Influential resourcist approach but assumes goods are fungible and tradeable through market mechanisms. Housing and location create envy-test complications: even with equal budgets, spatial scarcity means not everyone can occupy desirable locations. Our project explores whether resource equality can accommodate positional/located goods or requires supplementation.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques reduction of justice to distributive justice, arguing this paradigm treats justice as static pattern of goods allocation while ignoring processes, decision-making structures, division of labor, and culture. Identifies five faces of oppression (exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, cultural imperialism, violence) that cannot be reduced to distributive dimensions. Argues for justice as enablement of self-development and self-determination, requiring attention to political participation, recognition, and social structures beyond distribution. RELEVANCE: Foundational critique of distributive paradigm highly relevant to spatial justice. Young argues that focusing only on who gets what ignores how urban space is produced, who decides land use, whose cultures are recognized in public space. Her framework suggests housing justice requires examining power structures, political participation in planning, and recognition of diverse communities, not just fair allocation.

  doi = {10.1086/233897},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Critiques luck egalitarianism for focusing on distribution of non-relational goods among individuals rather than social relations. Argues proper aim of egalitarian justice is creating community where people relate as equals, eliminating oppression rather than equalizing brute luck effects. Democratic equality requires citizens relate as equals (political equality), equal standing (social equality), and capabilities to function as equals. Opposes pity-based redistribution, favors dignity-preserving social insurance and opportunity provision. RELEVANCE: Relational egalitarianism offers alternative framework for spatial justice beyond allocating housing as resource. Anderson suggests focus on whether urban arrangements create relations of equality or hierarchy, stigma, domination. Relevant to segregation, concentrated poverty, exclusionary zoning as creating relational inequality. Our project can draw on relational framework to argue housing justice concerns social relations in communities, not just resource distribution.

@book{sen1999development,
  author = {Sen, Amartya},
  title = {Development as Freedom},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {1999},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues development should be understood as expansion of substantive freedoms (capabilities) people enjoy, not merely economic growth or income. Capabilities are real freedoms to achieve functionings (beings and doings) one has reason to value. Distinguishes capabilities (what one can do/be) from functionings (actual achievements) and commodities (resources). Justice requires capability equality, not welfare or resource equality, because what matters is what people can actually do with resources given conversion factors (personal, social, environmental). RELEVANCE: Capabilities approach widely applied to spatial justice and housing. Unlike resourcist theories, capabilities framework can capture how place affects ability to convert resources into functionings—same income yields different capabilities in different neighborhoods (access to jobs, schools, safety). Basta (2016), Dummer (2025), and others use capabilities for housing justice. Our project can draw on Sen to argue temporal claims connect to capabilities: displacement destroys established capabilities regardless of compensation.

  title = {Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops capabilities approach with specific list of ten central human capabilities (life, bodily health, bodily integrity, senses/imagination/thought, emotions, practical reason, affiliation, other species, play, control over environment) required for life worthy of human dignity. Unlike Sen, argues for substantive universal list grounded in human dignity. Capabilities are what people are able to do and be, not just resources they have. Governments must ensure all meet capability thresholds as matter of basic justice and human rights. RELEVANCE: Nussbaum's list includes "control over one's environment" (both political participation in governance and material control, including land and property), directly relevant to housing and spatial justice. However, critics (including Dummer 2025) argue her list inadequately captures housing-specific concerns and lacks relational elements important for positional goods. Her threshold approach raises questions about spatial inequality above thresholds. Provides framework for housing as basic entitlement but may need supplementation for place-specific justice.

@book{hirsch1976social,
  author = {Hirsch, Fred},
  title = {Social Limits to Growth},
  publisher = {Harvard University Press},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  year = {1976},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces concept of "positional goods" whose value depends on relative position in distribution, not absolute quantity. As economies grow and incomes rise, increasing proportion of goods are positional—their utility depends on others not having them (elite education, scenic views, suburban neighborhoods, status goods). Unlike material goods which can be expanded, positional goods face absolute scarcity—if everyone has them, no one benefits. This creates "zero-sum" competition and social limits to growth that economic expansion cannot overcome. Distributive conflicts intensify as positional goods become more important. RELEVANCE: Foundational for understanding housing as positional good. Desirable neighborhoods are inherently scarce—cannot simply produce more "good locations." If housing has positional elements, standard distributive principles assuming expandable goods may fail. Hirsch's analysis suggests housing justice faces distinctive challenges from positional scarcity. Our project can draw on positional goods theory to explain why temporal claims (established position in desirable location) create justice issues beyond resource distribution. Recent work (2025) re-examines Hirsch's insights for distributive justice implications. POSITION: Positional goods theory, social limits to growth, scarcity, zero-sum competition.},

  address = {New York},
  year = {1992},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes principles and procedures institutions actually use to allocate scarce goods (college admissions, organ transplants, military conscription, worker layoffs) and necessary burdens. Distinguishes "local justice" (context-specific allocation principles) from "global justice" (society-wide distributive principles). Shows how institutions choose among equality, equity (merit/desert), efficiency, and need as allocation criteria, and how these interact. Allocation procedures may aggregate or balance principles differently. Argues actual allocation mechanisms often poorly match stated principles and may worsen inequalities. RELEVANCE: Directly relevant to housing allocation mechanisms. Elster shows how different allocation principles (lottery, queue, need, merit, market) apply to scarce non-divisible goods. Housing allocation uses multiple mechanisms (market, public housing waitlists, zoning, historical occupancy) each with different justice implications. His analysis of preference-formation and procedure-principle gaps illuminates housing policy debates. Our project can use Elster's framework to analyze temporal claims as one allocation principle (first-come priority, established occupancy) competing with others.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues that justice has a geography and that spatial distribution of resources, services, and access is a basic human right. Develops concept of "spatial justice" as distinct from social justice, focusing on fair distribution across space and just production of space itself. Shows how locational discrimination creates unjust geographies through urban planning, zoning, redlining, and spatial structures of privilege. Draws on Lefebvre and Harvey to argue space is socially produced and political. Uses Los Angeles case studies to demonstrate spatial injustice and struggles for spatial justice. RELEVANCE: Foundational work establishing spatial justice as distinct field. Soja argues geography is not merely backdrop to justice but constitutive—spatial arrangements themselves produce and reproduce injustice. Directly relevant to housing justice as spatial justice. However, Soja's framework remains largely descriptive and political; philosophical foundations for specifically spatial distributive principles remain underdeveloped.

  year = {1973},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Marxist analysis of how capitalism produces unjust urban space through uneven development, spatial fixes for capital accumulation crises, and commodification of land and housing. Argues urban spatial form reflects and reproduces class relations and capital accumulation imperatives. Justice requires examining not just distribution of goods but production of space itself and underlying property relations. Later work develops "right to the city" concept from Lefebvre—collective right to reshape urban space according to human needs not profit. RELEVANCE: Foundational critical geography text arguing spatial arrangements are products of capitalist political economy, not natural or neutral. Housing justice requires examining property relations, speculation, and capital flows, not just allocation principles. Harvey's framework suggests limits of liberal distributive justice for addressing spatial inequality rooted in capitalism. Our project must engage with critique that distributive approaches treat symptoms (unequal housing) not causes (commodification, property rights).

  address = {Ithaca},
  year = {2010},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops normative theory of urban justice based on three principles: equity (fair distribution), diversity (social/economic mixing, not segregation), and democracy (meaningful participation). Critiques communicative planning paradigm for assuming procedural fairness yields substantive justice without addressing structural inequalities. Argues capitalist cities can be made more just through progressive planning even without revolution. Synthesizes Rawls, Young, Sen, Harvey, and Nussbaum for urban context, proposing pragmatic progressive reform. RELEVANCE: Influential urban planning application of distributive justice theories. Fainstein recognizes tension among her three principles and need for balancing. Her equity principle covers housing allocation but diversity and democracy add non-distributive dimensions. Framework is explicitly spatial and urban, bridging philosophy and planning. Useful for our project's engagement with housing policy.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes racially segregated, economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods ("dark ghettos") as symptoms of systemic injustice in American social structure, not merely unfortunate outcomes or cultural pathologies. Applies Rawlsian justice framework to argue ghettos violate principles of reciprocity, fair equality of opportunity, and civic equality. Residents have civic duty to improve conditions but not to self-reform per mainstream respectability politics—injustice lies in basic structure. Segregation per se is morally neutral; injustice is the concentrated disadvantage and limited opportunities it enables. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated philosophical analysis of spatial injustice, segregation, and concentrated poverty. Shelby shows how distributive justice principles apply to geographic concentration of disadvantage. Directly relevant to housing justice and temporal claims—displacement from gentrifying ghettos raises questions about residents' claims to place despite neighborhood's injustice. Shelby's framework treats spatial arrangements as part of basic structure subject to justice principles. However, focuses more on obligations than entitlements; less developed theory of positive housing rights or allocation principles.

  author = {Stilz, Anna},
  title = {Territorial Sovereignty: A Philosophical Exploration},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2019},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops Kantian theory of territorial rights based on individual autonomy requiring protection of three territorial interests: occupancy (stable use of land), basic justice (effective law), and self-determination (collective governance). Legitimate states have territorial rights when they implement law governing property, subjects have legitimate occupancy claims, state rules in name of people protecting rights and participation, and state is not usurper. Territorial rights ground claims against displacement and support territorial jurisdiction. Recent work (2024) applies framework to climate displacement. RELEVANCE: Provides philosophical foundation for occupancy rights and claims against displacement. Stilz's occupancy interest grounds moral significance of established residence beyond property ownership. Relevant to temporal dimension of housing claims—long-term occupancy creates justice-relevant interests even without ownership. However, Stilz focuses on state territory and self-determination, not intra-state housing distribution.

  pages = {68--93},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues contemporary justice struggles require both redistribution (economic justice) and recognition (cultural justice). Redistribution addresses economic injustice (exploitation, marginalization) through political-economic restructuring. Recognition addresses cultural injustice (cultural domination, non-recognition, disrespect) through cultural change. Some groups face primarily redistribution issues (class), others primarily recognition issues (sexuality), many face both (race, gender). Proposes "participatory parity" as normative framework—justice requires social arrangements permitting all to participate as peers. Later adds representation (political voice) as third dimension. RELEVANCE: Fraser's two-dimensional (later three-dimensional) justice framework is widely applied to spatial justice. Housing involves both redistribution (who gets housing resources) and recognition (whose neighborhoods are valued, whose communities count). Segregation and urban inequality have both economic and cultural dimensions. Relevant to our project's analysis of housing beyond pure distribution—community recognition, voice in planning, cultural respect matter.

  title = {Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale: The Moral Limits of Markets},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2010},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes when and why certain markets are "noxious"—morally objectionable even if voluntary and welfare-improving. Develops four-parameter framework: markets are problematic when they involve (1) vulnerability of participants, (2) weak agency (deception, coercion, limited understanding), (3) extremely harmful individual outcomes, or (4) extremely harmful social outcomes (reinforcing inequality or discrimination). Examines prostitution, commercial surrogacy, child labor, kidney sales. Some goods' social meanings or distribution methods matter morally, not just final allocations. RELEVANCE: Satz's framework for special goods and market limits is relevant to housing commodification debates. Housing markets may score problematically on vulnerability (desperation sales), harmful outcomes (homelessness, segregation), and social harms (concentrated disadvantage). Her framework suggests pure market allocation of housing may be noxious even if Pareto-improving. Relevant to our project's concern with whether housing is special good requiring non-market allocation principles. However, Satz focuses on banning markets, less on alternative allocation mechanisms.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends luck egalitarianism against Rawls's constructivism and difference principle. Argues justice fundamentally concerns eliminating inequalities due to brute luck (circumstances beyond control), not merely improving worst-off position. Critiques Rawls for (1) allowing inequalities that don't benefit worst-off (incentive argument) when talented could work harder from justice not self-interest, (2) conflating justice with optimal regulation, (3) limiting justice to basic structure not personal choices. Justice is fact-independent, not constructed from procedures. Argues for pure equality uncompromised by incentive concerns. RELEVANCE: Cohen represents pure luck egalitarian position on distributive justice—neutralize luck, not just help worst-off. Relevant to housing justice debates about whether spatial inequality due to circumstances (where one is born) is unjust requiring correction, or acceptable if markets improve overall access. Cohen would critique housing inequality from brute luck (birthplace, family location) even if some inequality improves access overall. However, luck egalitarianism faces challenges with non-fungible located goods where equal resources don't eliminate luck-based positional inequality. POSITION: Luck egalitarianism, critique of Rawls, fact-independent justice, pure equality, personal responsibility.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues egalitarianism's fundamental concern is establishing society of equals where people relate as equals, not primarily distributional pattern. Critiques luck egalitarianism's focus on neutralizing brute luck as misunderstanding egalitarianism's point. Relational view asks whether social arrangements are congruent with idea of society of equals—do institutions and practices enable equal standing, mutual respect, reciprocity? Distributive patterns matter derivatively as they affect social relations. Develops relational egalitarian alternative emphasizing status equality over distributional equality. RELEVANCE: Scheffler's relational egalitarianism (with Anderson, Young) offers alternative to distributive paradigm for spatial justice. Housing justice would concern whether residential patterns create relations of equality or hierarchy, stigma, exclusion. Segregation violates relational equality even if resource distribution seems fair. Relevant to our project's examination of housing beyond distribution—community relations, status, social integration matter. However, relational approach needs specification for determining which inequalities undermine equal standing in spatial contexts.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Systematic review of how justice is conceptualized in spatial planning literature. Identifies distributive justice (equality as marker, applied to resources and opportunities distribution), procedural justice (participation, transparency), and recognitional justice (respect for diversity, marginalized voices) as main dimensions. Notes spatial planning often uses "equality" without clarifying what kind or equality of what. Discusses Basta's (2016) concept of spatial primary goods. Argues planning literature needs more conceptual precision about justice frameworks and their spatial applications. RELEVANCE: Recent (2025) systematic review showing state of justice discourse in planning. Confirms gap between philosophical precision and planning application of justice concepts. Shows distributive, procedural, and recognitional justice all appear in spatial planning but often unclearly. Relevant to our project's need to clarify conceptual foundations for housing justice. Identifies Basta's spatial primary goods as important concept. Demonstrates that spatial planning grapples with multiple justice dimensions simultaneously, supporting multidimensional approach to housing justice.
