====================================================================

DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The temporal dimension of justice addresses how justice principles apply across time, including obligations between past, present, and future generations who may not coexist. This rapidly developing field encompasses several interconnected strands: (1) diachronic vs. synchronic justice - whether justice should be assessed at a single time-slice or across the entire course of lives/societies; (2) historical injustice and rectification - whether and how past wrongs generate present obligations, including the "supersession thesis" that changing circumstances can alter what justice requires; (3) intergenerational justice - what present generations owe to future (and past) people, complicated by the non-identity problem; (4) path dependency - how historical choices constrain present options and create temporal lock-in effects; (5) temporal priority principles - how to weight past occupancy versus current need versus future opportunity in allocating scarce located goods like housing and territory.

Key debates include: Waldron's supersession thesis (1992) versus critics arguing historical claims persist despite changed circumstances; Rawlsian time-slice principles versus historical entitlement theories (Nozick); person-affecting versus impersonal approaches to future generations; backward-looking (reparative) versus forward-looking (distributive) justice. Recent work (2015-2025) has applied these frameworks to climate justice, territorial rights, gentrification, indigenous land claims, and colonial reparations. The field has evolved from abstract philosophical puzzles to urgent practical applications, with significant empirical and normative integration.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain is CENTRAL to the housing justice research project. The core challenge - adjudicating between incumbent residents' claims based on past occupancy versus newcomers' claims based on present/future need - is precisely a temporal justice problem. The project requires principles for: (1) how to weight historical attachment and investment versus current housing need; (2) whether historical injustices (redlining, urban renewal, displacement) create persistent claims or can be superseded; (3) how path dependency constrains just housing allocation (e.g., neighborhoods shaped by past discrimination); (4) temporal framing of housing rights (moment-in-time vs. life-course vs. intergenerational). The supersession debate directly addresses whether gentrification-induced displacement wrongs can be rectified or are overtaken by changed circumstances. Occupancy rights theory provides conceptual tools for understanding place-based claims that accumulate over time.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:
The field has seen explosive growth 2015-2025 with major monographs on territorial justice (Moore 2015, Stilz 2019, Nine 2022), intergenerational justice (Bidadanure 2021, Gosseries 2023, Truccone 2024), and climate justice (Caney's work 2014-2024). The supersession thesis has been comprehensively debated through Meyer & Waligore's 2022 special issue and 2023 book. Critical innovations include: Stilz's defense of occupancy rights independent of historical title; Bidadanure's integration of age-group justice with diachronic evaluation; Krishnamurthy & Moore's 2024 application to gentrification; Truccone's 2024 synthesis addressing post-colonial and climate injustices; growing attention to relational egalitarianism's temporal limits (Lippert-Rasmussen 2025). Empirical turn includes neuroscience of temporal discounting, behavioral economics of intertemporal choice, and climate science urgency.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Limited direct application to urban housing allocation (Krishnamurthy & Moore 2024 is exception). Few works integrate temporal justice with located goods theory - most focus on fungible resources or abstract territory. Underdeveloped empirical operationalization of philosophical concepts like "reasons-responsiveness over time" or "occupancy rights thresholds." Little engagement with short-term rental markets, housing financialization, or demographic transitions. Insufficient attention to intersectionality - how temporal claims interact with race, class, and migration status over time. Need for more work on institutional design for temporal justice (beyond climate assemblies). Path dependency remains more descriptive (legal/economic) than normative (philosophical).

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:
For the literature review, prioritize: (1) Waldron (1992) and Meyer & Waligore (2022) on supersession as conceptual foundation; (2) Goodin (2010) on temporal justice framework; (3) Gosseries (2023) and Thompson (2002) on intergenerational obligations; (4) Stilz (2013, 2019) and Moore (2015) on occupancy and territorial rights; (5) Krishnamurthy & Moore (2024) as direct application to gentrification. Key tension: backward-looking historical claims versus forward-looking distributive justice - housing project must navigate this. Distinguish pure historical entitlement (Nozick, problematic for displacement) from occupancy-based claims (Stilz, more promising) from pure distribution (Rawls, ignores attachment). Consider how path dependency creates moral constraints on distributive justice even if historical claims don't persist indefinitely.

KEY_POSITIONS:
- Historical supersession: 5 papers - Waldron's thesis that changed circumstances can supersede historical claims
- Anti-supersession/persistent claims: 4 papers - Meyer, Thompson, Butt arguing historical injustices create enduring obligations
- Intergenerational justice theories: 4 papers - Gosseries, Caney, Bidadanure on obligations across time
- Occupancy rights theory: 3 papers - Stilz, Moore, Nine on place-based temporal claims
- Temporal framing/diachronic justice: 3 papers - Goodin, Truccone on how time affects justice assessment
- Applications (climate, territory, gentrification): 2 papers - Recent applied work

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Advances the "supersession thesis" - if a historical injustice occurs at time T1 leading to an unjust situation, morally relevant changes in circumstances can occur such that at time T2 justice does not require (and may prohibit) rectification to the original situation. Uses indigenous land claims as paradigm case, arguing population increases and environmental changes mean historical entitlements can no longer be justified relative to contemporary needs. The thesis holds that a distribution of resources that was unjustly established may become a just (or not unjust) distribution in the present given changed circumstances. RELEVANCE: Foundational to temporal justice debates and directly applicable to housing displacement. If supersession holds, incumbent residents' claims based on past occupancy could be overridden by newcomers' current needs when circumstances change sufficiently (e.g., urban development, population growth). However, if supersession fails, historical displacement wrongs create persistent claims. The housing project must address whether gentrification-induced displacement can supersede earlier residents' claims or whether those claims endure. POSITION: Historical injustice can be superseded by changed circumstances, limiting scope of rectificatory justice.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Introduction to special issue critically assessing Waldron's supersession thesis. Distinguishes between partial and full supersession, and between dormant supersession (for-the-time-being) and final supersession (for-all-time). Contributors examine Waldron's later writings on sovereignty, group identity, and treaties, drawing on settler colonial theory and Indigenous perspectives. Argues supersession debate must address: (1) what counts as morally relevant changed circumstances, (2) whether Indigenous peoples' territorial claims can be superseded differently than property claims, (3) how group identity and continuity affect temporal claims. RELEVANCE: Provides sophisticated conceptual apparatus for analyzing temporal claims in housing. Partial/full and dormant/final distinctions apply to displacement: Can gentrification partially supersede but not fully eliminate incumbent claims? Can supersession be dormant (claims reassert if circumstances change again)? Essential for operationalizing temporal priority principles - the project needs criteria for "morally relevant changed circumstances" in urban housing contexts.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive treatment of what present generations owe to future and past generations. Central challenge is temporal non-overlap - generations existing at different times cannot reciprocate, cooperate, or contract. Defends both person-affecting and impersonal considerations for intergenerational obligations. Addresses diachronic notions of harm where actions don't make specific individuals worse off but affect overall well-being of future people. Examines temporal dimension requiring institutions sensitive to time, distinguishing between obligations to determinate future people versus indeterminate future people (non-identity problem). RELEVANCE: Housing allocation involves intergenerational claims - current residents versus future residents, children who will grow up in neighborhoods, legacy for next generation. Gosseries' framework helps assess whether housing justice is only about existing people or includes obligations to future community members. The non-overlap problem applies to displaced former residents who no longer exist in neighborhood versus future newcomers. Temporal sensitivity requirement suggests housing policy must consider long-term community development, not just current allocation. POSITION: Intergenerational justice requires both person-affecting and impersonal principles, with institutions designed for temporal sensitivity.},

  number = {1},
  pages = {1--16},
  doi = {10.1017/S0047279409003231},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Introduces concept of "temporal justice" - distributive justice should extend beyond monetary resources to include time, specifically discretionary time (time over which one has autonomous control after necessary tasks). Magnitude of gap between discretionary time enjoyed by best and worst off is measure of temporal injustice. Argues justice requires considering not just what resources people have but also when they can use them and how much control they have over timing. Shows substantial variation across countries (larger gaps in US/Australia, smaller in Finland/Sweden). RELEVANCE: Housing has profound temporal justice implications. Long commutes from affordable housing reduce discretionary time. Displacement disrupts temporal rhythms of community participation and family life. Gentrification often forces time-poverty trade-offs (more hours worked farther from home to afford rising rents). Housing stability provides temporal security for long-term planning. The project should integrate temporal justice framework - housing allocation affects not just what people have but their control over time and life-course planning. Temporal framing shapes justice assessments: moment-in-time versus life-course versus intergenerational. POSITION: Justice extends to temporal dimension - distribution of discretionary time and temporal autonomy matter morally.},

  author = {Thompson, Janna},
  title = {Taking Responsibility for the Past: Reparation and Historical Injustice},
  publisher = {Polity Press},
  address = {Cambridge},
  year = {2002},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends robust obligations to repair historical injustices against supersession arguments. Current generations of political societies have obligations to repair injustices committed by predecessors because maintaining a just political society requires each generation to keep commitments and repair injustices of predecessors. Uses intergenerational ties within nations and family lines to establish links between current obligations and past injustice. Argues that justice requires not just forward-looking distribution but backward-looking rectification - historical wrongs create enduring moral debts. Examines apology, reparations, and restorative justice for slavery, colonialism, and indigenous dispossession. RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to historical housing injustices (redlining, urban renewal, discriminatory lending, forced displacement). If Thompson is right, communities facing current gentrification may have persistent claims based on past displacement, even if circumstances have changed. Intergenerational family ties mean descendants of displaced residents have standing for reparations. The project must address whether housing policy should be purely forward-looking (distributive) or must incorporate backward-looking (reparative) elements. Thompson's framework suggests current housing allocation cannot ignore legacy of past injustices.

  number = {4},
  pages = {324--356},
  doi = {10.1111/papa.12024},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory of occupancy rights - people's preinstitutional moral claims to specific geographical places where they permanently reside, participate in ongoing practices, and are immune from removal. Occupancy rights are temporally acquired through residence and life-planning but don't depend on historically "clean" title - can be established even after unjust dispossession. Distinguishes occupancy (location-specific) from property (transferable). Argues removal from one's place of occupancy is serious wrong even without full ownership. Present occupancy generates moral claims independent of how the occupancy began. RELEVANCE: Powerful framework for housing justice and gentrification. Longtime residents acquire occupancy rights through residence, community participation, life-planning around place, even if they rent rather than own. Displacement violates these rights. Crucially, occupancy rights can arise despite unjust past (neighborhood shaped by redlining) - current residents' claims don't require perfect historical title. This helps address path dependency: even if neighborhood resulted from injustice, current occupants have genuine claims. The project can use occupancy rights to explain wrongness of gentrification displacement independent of property ownership. Temporal dimension: occupancy strengthens over time through deepening attachment and investment. POSITION: Place-based occupancy rights ground anti-displacement claims, established through temporal residence independent of historical title.},

  year = {2015},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190222246.001.0001},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends political self-determination theory of territorial rights. Peoples (not states or cultural nations) have rights to territories through legitimate occupancy - members residing in territory and planning lives around relationship to it. Three foundations: individual moral rights of residency, collective moral rights of occupancy, and peoples' rights of self-determination. Occupancy generates jurisdiction rights. Addresses corrective justice for historical territorial injustices, arguing past wrongs must be balanced against present occupancy claims. Time matters: longer occupancy strengthens claims, but passage of time doesn't automatically erase injustice. RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to urban neighborhoods as territories. Residential communities constitute "peoples" with collective self-determination interests. Long-term residents have both individual residency rights and collective occupancy rights to their neighborhood. Gentrification threatens territorial self-determination - community loses control over neighborhood's future. Moore's framework for historical injustice applies to redlining, urban renewal: past wrongs matter but must be weighed against present occupants' claims. The project can adapt territorial rights theory from nations to neighborhoods, examining how communities acquire jurisdictional claims through temporal occupancy. Path dependency: historical injustices shape territorial boundaries and occupancy patterns.

  doi = {10.1093/oso/9780198833536.001.0001},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive defense of territorial states system based on three values: occupancy, basic justice, and collective self-determination. Develops detailed account of occupancy rights: right to permanently reside, participate in ongoing practices, immunity from removal, and return if temporarily absent. Crucially argues present occupancy rights don't depend on historically clean title - can arise after dispossession. Discusses "layered" territorial rights when multiple groups have claims. Addresses expulsion, return, and resettlement across time. Temporal dimension central: occupancy establishes over time, but unjust past doesn't necessarily invalidate present claims. RELEVANCE: Expanded framework for housing justice. Occupancy rights include participation in social/cultural/economic practices - exactly what gentrification disrupts. Immunity from removal and right of return directly address displacement. "Layered rights" concept helps analyze neighborhoods with multiple temporal claimants (displaced former residents, current residents, potential newcomers). Stilz's argument that unjust origins don't vitiate present occupancy applies to path dependency in housing: neighborhoods shaped by discrimination can still ground legitimate occupancy claims by current residents. The project benefits from Stilz's sophisticated treatment of temporal complexity in territorial claims. POSITION: Occupancy rights are core to territorial justice, established through time, relatively independent of historical injustice in origins.},

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  address = {Oxford},
  year = {2021},
  isbn = {9780198792185},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops theory of age-group justice combining complete life egalitarianism, lifespan prudence, and relational egalitarianism. Some inequalities between age groups matter independently of their diachronic impact - relational reasons for equality at each life stage. Distinguishes temporary age-group inequalities (acceptable if everyone experiences them across complete life) from generational inequalities (problematic when temporary inequalities become permanent for cohorts, as after 2008 recession). Temporal perspective essential: justice assessment requires both synchronic (moment-in-time) and diachronic (across lifespan) evaluation. RELEVANCE: Housing allocation has profound age-group dimensions. Young adults priced out of urban housing face both age-group inequality (synchronic) and potential generational inequality if they never recover access (diachronic). Elderly longtime residents facing displacement lose life-stage appropriate housing. Bidadanure's framework suggests housing justice must consider: (1) fair distribution across age groups at given time, (2) fair distribution across complete lives, (3) relational equality at each life stage. Temporal framing matters: policy benefiting young today may be prudent life-course investment, but systematic exclusion of cohort is unjust. The project should assess whether housing inequality between age groups reflects acceptable life-course variation or unjust generational stratification. POSITION: Age-group justice requires both complete-life diachronic equality and moment-in-time relational equality.},

  pages = {320--342},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X14542566},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines three kinds of discounting for intergenerational climate obligations: pure time discounting (discounting future people simply because they exist later), growth discounting (discounting because future people will be wealthier), and opportunity cost discounting (discounting because resources could be invested for higher returns). Argues none justify delaying aggressive climate mitigation. Pure time discounting is unjust discrimination based on when people are alive. Temporal location should not affect moral weight. Analyzes "harmful short-termism" in politics - mismatch between timespan of climate problem and temporal horizons of citizens/politicians. RELEVANCE: Temporal discounting applies to housing justice. Should future residents' housing needs be discounted compared to current residents' attachment? Caney's argument against temporal discrimination suggests not - future generations' need for affordable housing matters equally to current displacement concerns. However, epistemic uncertainty about future (who will live where, what housing needs will be) complicates this. Short-termism in housing policy parallels climate: political incentives favor current homeowners over future renters, creating generational inequity. The project should examine temporal discounting in housing allocation - do we systematically underweight future housing needs and overweight present occupancy claims? POSITION: Pure temporal discounting is morally arbitrary - when people exist doesn't affect their moral status or claims.},

  doi = {10.1177/0964663911435932},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines rectification of colonial injustices, arguing against simple supersession. Colonialism created three morally relevant connections to past: benefit (contemporary states benefited from colonial exploitation), entitlement (resources were wrongfully taken), and responsibility (current political communities succeeded colonial powers). Even without direct causal benefit, responsibility-based claims persist. Historical injustice raises distinct theoretical problems requiring temporal analysis. Distinguishes between compensation (making victims whole) and restitution (returning what was taken). Passage of time complicates but doesn't eliminate rectificatory duties. RELEVANCE: Framework applies to historical housing injustices. Contemporary property distributions reflect past redlining, urban renewal, discriminatory lending - current homeowners/developers benefit from unjust system. Communities that were redlined have entitlement claims to what was denied. Political jurisdictions (cities, housing authorities) bear responsibility as successors to institutions that perpetrated injustice. The project must address whether rectificatory justice requires: (1) compensation for past displacement, (2) restitution of housing/neighborhoods, (3) symbolic reparations, or (4) structural reform. Butt's analysis of benefit, entitlement, and responsibility provides framework for tracing temporal connections from historical housing wrongs to present claims.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops comprehensive theory of rectificatory justice between nations based on three morally relevant connections to past: benefit (unjust enrichment), entitlement (wrongful taking), and responsibility (succession to wrongdoing institutions). Argues historical injustice persists across time through these connections, generating duties for contemporary affluent states to world's poorest peoples. Distinguishes restitution (returning specific items) from compensation (equivalent value). Examines how passage of time affects claims: delayed compensation must account for interest/opportunity costs; supersession requires very strong changed circumstances. Addresses non-identity problem: even if specific victims no longer exist, communities/peoples persist with claims. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated framework for temporal dimension of rectificatory justice applicable to housing. Urban housing wealth reflects historical injustice (segregation, redlining, contract buying, urban renewal) - current property owners benefit from unjust system even without directly causing harm. Displaced communities and their descendants have entitlement claims. Cities/housing authorities bear responsibility as successor institutions. The project needs principles for: how much weight to give rectification versus current distribution, how to compensate for delayed justice (displaced residents lost decades of asset appreciation), when changed circumstances supersede claims. Butt's benefit/entitlement/responsibility trichotomy provides structure for analyzing temporal claims.

  number = {4},
  pages = {383--399},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends national responsibility for historical injustice. Nations are collective agents with temporal continuity - they share past history and inherit benefits from previous generations, so current members can be collectively responsible for past actions. Develops "correspondence model" - redress should correspond to nature of original injustice. Three sources of remedial responsibility: remedying one's nation's past injustices, addressing failures in fair cooperation, and responding to poverty itself. Historical injustices create enduring obligations that don't simply fade with time. National identity provides intergenerational continuity making temporal responsibility possible. RELEVANCE: Framework extends to cities/neighborhoods as collective agents with temporal continuity. Current urban residents inherit benefits from past policies (homeownership subsidies, infrastructure investment) and bear responsibility for past injustices (redlining, displacement). Correspondence model suggests appropriate redress depends on injury type: forced removal requires right of return or housing priority, wealth extraction requires monetary reparations, community destruction requires rebuilding institutions. The project can analyze cities as temporally extended agents with collective responsibility for housing injustices. Temporal dimension: cities persist across generations with continuous identity, enabling responsibility across time. Challenges: how to allocate responsibility when urban populations turn over?

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes colonialism not as violation of territorial property rights but as objectionable form of political relation. Colonial wrongs: (1) forcing people into political associations non-consensually, and (2) establishing association terms through unequal, non-reciprocal power. Even if colonialism brought benefits, the relational wrong persists - justice requires equal standing in determining collective political life. Historical aspect: colonial relationships established in past continue shaping present political structures and economic relations. Past domination creates present structural inequality. Temporal dimension: relational injustice doesn't simply end when formal colonialism ends; legacy persists in institutions and material conditions. RELEVANCE: Gentrification as relational injustice paralleling colonialism. Longtime residents forced into new "political association" (neighborhood governance, community character) they didn't consent to, with terms set by powerful newcomers/developers rather than equal negotiation. Even if gentrification brings benefits (investment, services), the relational wrong remains - displacement of existing community, loss of self-determination over neighborhood future. Ypi's framework suggests housing justice requires not just fair distribution but equal standing in decisions about community. Temporal dimension: historical displacement creates persistent relational inequality - communities lack power to shape neighborhood because past injustice excluded them from political/economic institutions. POSITION: Injustice is fundamentally relational - domination and exclusion from equal participation - with temporal persistence in structures.},

  doi = {10.1163/17455243-20244117},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops pluralistic account of wrongness of gentrification based on three place-related rights: (1) rights to a home (secure shelter for core life activities), (2) rights of residency (stable membership in political community with participation rights), and (3) place-based rights to community (connection to specific neighborhood's social/cultural practices). Gentrification violates all three simultaneously. Place-attachment has temporal dimension - deepens over time through lived experience, relationships, and investment. Displacement severs these temporal connections. Framework addresses standard objections: not just about property ownership (renters have place-rights), not purely distributive (relational and participatory dimensions), not contingent on community homogeneity. RELEVANCE: Most directly applicable paper to housing justice project! Provides philosophical framework specifically for gentrification wrong. Three place-rights map onto temporal dimensions: home rights (stable shelter over time), residency rights (temporal membership in community), community rights (participation in ongoing practices). Temporal aspect central: long-term residence strengthens all three types of claims through deeper attachment, thicker relationships, greater investment. The project can use this framework to explain why displacement wrongs even long-term renters (residency and community rights), why it matters even if displaced find equivalent housing elsewhere (place-specificity), and how temporal occupancy grounds moral claims independent of property ownership. Critical for operationalizing temporal justice in housing context. POSITION: Gentrification wrongs by violating temporally-accrued place-based rights to home, residency, and community.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Compares historical entitlement theory (Simmons) with occupancy/self-determination theory (Moore, Stilz) for addressing historical territorial injustices, using Indigenous land theft as case. Examines three problems: Continuity Problem (are current claimants same agents as original victims?), Particularity Problem (why this specific land rather than equivalent territory?), Distributive Justice Problem (how to balance historical claims against current needs?). Argues occupancy/self-determination theory better addresses all three, but historical title theory can be modified. Key insight: current occupancy generates claims even without clean historical title, but historical injustice still matters for rectification. Temporal dimension: passage of time affects but doesn't erase injustice claims. RELEVANCE: Directly applicable to housing displacement. Continuity Problem: are current neighborhood residents/descendants "same" as those displaced decades ago? Particularity Problem: why do displaced residents need to return to specific neighborhood rather than equivalent housing elsewhere? (Answer: place-specific attachment and community). Distributive Justice Problem: how to balance displaced residents' historical claims against current residents' occupancy claims and newcomers' housing needs? The project must navigate this three-way temporal tension. Luoma & Moore's preference for occupancy theory over pure historical title suggests housing justice should focus on current attachment/residency rather than tracing chains of historical entitlement, but with special weight for rectifying past displacement.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Comprehensive examination of temporal dimension in justice theory. Core question: should historical injustices always be repaired? Argues that circumstances change over time affecting justice (supersession), but repairing historical injustices can and must be reconciled with distributive justice imperatives. Examines supersession thesis in two contexts: post-colonial injustices against Latin American indigenous peoples and climate burden distribution. Four aspects of historical injustice: (1) temporal dimension of justice itself, (2) connection between current claimants/duty-bearers and original victims/perpetrators, (3) how changed circumstances affect justice requirements, (4) appropriate forms of reparation. Defends reconciliation of reparative and distributive justice rather than choosing between them. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated synthesis directly applicable to housing justice temporal dilemmas. Housing faces exactly Truccone's core tension: reconciling backward-looking claims (displaced residents deserve rectification) with forward-looking distributive justice (newcomers need affordable housing). Truccone's four-aspect framework structures analysis: (1) How does time itself affect housing justice assessment? (2) What connections link current actors to past displacement? (3) When do changed circumstances (neighborhood transformation, demographic shifts) alter justice requirements? (4) What forms of housing reparation are appropriate (return, compensation, priority access)? Critical insight: don't simply choose reparative vs. distributive - integrate both. The project needs principles for this integration in housing context. POSITION: Temporal justice requires reconciling, not choosing between, reparative (backward-looking) and distributive (forward-looking) justice.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends "river model" of territorial rights based on interdependence and overlapping claims rather than exclusive sovereignty. Groups are spatially interconnected through shared resources (rivers, urban areas), requiring collective management through nested and overlapping jurisdictions. Develops "functional autonomy" concept - self-determination measured by performance of specific political functions rather than exclusive territorial control. Foundational territories established around geographical interdependence may overlap existing state boundaries. Temporal dimension: territories emerge through ongoing resource management relationships over time, not just historical title. RELEVANCE: Innovative framework for urban housing. Neighborhoods are paradigmatic overlapping territories - multiple groups (longtime residents, recent arrivals, commuters, landlords, city-wide community) have legitimate but overlapping claims based on different relationships to place. Exclusive territorial control by any single group is neither feasible nor just. Temporal claims vary: longtime residents have deep occupancy claims, newcomers have housing needs and emerging attachment, city has jurisdiction, landlords have property interests. Nine's functional autonomy suggests each group should have self-determination for specific functions rather than total control. Housing project could develop "overlapping housing rights" framework: different stakeholders with different temporal depths of claim exercising different types of authority (residency decisions, community character, development planning, resource allocation). Challenges winner-take-all displacement logic. POSITION: Territorial rights should be overlapping and nested rather than exclusive, based on functional interdependence over time.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines whether relational egalitarianism can handle intergenerational justice given temporal non-overlap. Argument from Temporal Non-Overlap: if social relations are crucial for justice (relational egalitarianism), but we don't socially relate to non-overlapping future generations, then relational egalitarianism provides incomplete justice theory. Defends relational egalitarianism by arguing temporal non-overlap doesn't preclude relevant relationships. However, acknowledges tension: standard relational accounts emphasize reciprocal relationships, but future people can't reciprocate. Examines scope and time-frame of egalitarian justice. RELEVANCE: Displacement involves temporal non-overlap. Former residents no longer present in neighborhood don't overlap with current/future residents. Can relational justice framework handle their claims? If justice requires actual relationships, do displaced people lose claims once they leave? Or do past relationships create enduring obligations? Housing project faces this puzzle: gentrification disrupts actual relationships (people scatter), but claims seem to persist. Lippert-Rasmussen's analysis suggests need for justice theory that handles both: relational dimensions (actual communities) and non-relational dimensions (obligations to non-overlapping past/future residents). Temporal framing matters: should we assess housing justice at moment-in-time (who's currently here?) or across time (who was here, who will be here?). POSITION: Temporal non-overlap creates theoretical challenge for relational egalitarianism requiring modification to handle intergenerational justice.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11158-025-09741-y},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines temporal indeterminacy in normative reasoning - the way time itself affects what justice requires. Justice principles don't simply apply timelessly; their content and demands shift based on temporal framing and rhythm. Normative reasoning operates at different temporal scales (moment-to-moment, life-course, intergenerational) producing different assessments. "Rhythm" metaphor captures how justice claims pulse and vary with temporal perspective. Addresses how to integrate synchronic (snapshot) and diachronic (across-time) evaluation. Temporal indeterminacy means same situation can yield different justice assessments depending on time-frame adopted. RELEVANCE: Housing justice exhibits profound temporal indeterminacy. Assess at single moment: newcomers need housing now. Assess across life-course: longtime residents have decades of investment. Assess intergenerationally: displaced communities lost generational wealth accumulation. Different time-frames support different claims. The housing project must address this temporal indeterminacy - not just which claims win but what temporal frame(s) are appropriate for assessment. Cockburn's "rhythm" metaphor helps understand how displacement disrupts temporal patterns of community life. Short-term fluctuations (new residents moving in) differ from long-term trends (systematic demographic replacement). Policy must navigate multiple temporal scales simultaneously. Critical methodological insight for integrating synchronic housing needs with diachronic occupancy claims. POSITION: Justice reasoning involves temporal indeterminacy - different time-frames produce different normative assessments requiring integration.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "pluralist internationalism" theory of global justice emphasizing humanity's collective ownership of earth. All humans in present generation AND across generations have symmetrical claims to earth's resources and spaces. Common ownership holds each person has equal opportunity to satisfy basic needs from collectively owned resources. These resources "exist independently of human contributions" - we didn't create them. Provides insights into obligations to future generations and climate change. Non-relational grounds of justice based on shared ownership of planet across time. RELEVANCE: Urban land is quintessential collectively owned resource. Location value (most housing value) is socially created and inherited across generations, not individual contribution. Risse's framework suggests current residents don't have absolute claims to exclude newcomers from urban land - it's collective inheritance. However, occupancy creates legitimate claims to specific parcels. Tension: collective ownership supports newcomer access (they co-own earth), but temporal occupancy supports incumbent protection. Intergenerational dimension: current generation doesn't simply inherit cities from past but holds them in trust for future. Housing project must balance: (1) collective ownership (no one created urban land), (2) occupancy rights (temporal residence creates claims), (3) intergenerational trust (obligations to future residents). Risse's symmetrical claims across generations challenges pure incumbency preference. POSITION: Global justice based on collective ownership of earth across generations, creating symmetrical claims for all persons present and future.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Challenges doctrine of permanent sovereignty over natural resources. States may regulate access to resources and determine exploitation, but shouldn't have exclusive control over income generated - should be redistributed to equalize access to well-being. Natural resources "exist independently of human contributions" so no historical entitlement justifies permanent exclusive control. Global equality demands dispersing resource rights away from nation-state. Even if state acquired territory justly, doesn't follow that it has permanent sovereignty over resource benefits. Temporal dimension: "permanent" sovereignty problematic - circumstances change, populations change, justice requirements change. RELEVANCE: Urban land is natural resource - location value not created by any individual. Armstrong's critique of permanent sovereignty challenges permanent exclusion of newcomers from valuable urban locations based solely on incumbency. If natural resources should be shared for global equality, urban land should be accessible to those needing housing, not permanently controlled by current residents/owners. However, occupancy creates legitimate claims beyond pure resource extraction. Temporal tension: Armstrong challenges historical entitlement giving permanent control, but occupancy builds over time creating strengthening claims. Housing project must navigate: natural resource dimension (land should be shared) versus occupancy dimension (residence creates place-specific claims). Armstrong's framework suggests pure exclusion of newcomers based on incumbent territorial control is unjustifiable, but doesn't address occupancy rights specifically. POSITION: Natural resources shouldn't be under permanent sovereign control but shared for global equality, challenging historical entitlement claims.},
