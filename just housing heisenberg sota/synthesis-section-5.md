## Section 5: The Economics of Located Goods: Agglomeration, Lock-in, and Spatial Injustice

### Agglomeration Economics: Why Location is Not Fungible

Urban economics provides the empirical foundation demonstrating that location-specific value is real, substantial, and irreducible. Agglomeration economies—productivity gains from geographic concentration—operate through three fundamental mechanisms (Duranton and Puga 2004). First, sharing: cities enable sharing of indivisible facilities, gains from variety in suppliers and services, and risk pooling in labor markets. Second, matching: thick urban labor markets improve match quality between workers and jobs, and accelerate the matching process through greater numbers of potential partners. Third, learning: dense urban environments facilitate knowledge generation, diffusion, and accumulation through face-to-face contact that cannot be replicated through telecommunications.

The empirical magnitudes establish that these mechanisms create first-order economic effects. Combes and Gobillon's (2015) comprehensive synthesis, using sophisticated identification strategies to address worker sorting and reverse causality, finds that doubling city population increases wages by 2-5% after controlling for selection effects. These agglomeration benefits are highly localized: Rosenthal and Strange (2004) document that productivity gains decay rapidly with distance, concentrated within 1-5 miles rather than spreading across entire metropolitan areas. The effects are stronger for high-skilled workers and knowledge-intensive industries, but Moretti (2011) demonstrates that low-skilled workers also benefit substantially from proximity to high-skilled workers through local multiplier effects—each high-tech job creates approximately five additional local service jobs, spreading productivity gains broadly within cities.

The distribution of these gains is profoundly unequal. Albouy and Shin's (2018) measurement of metropolitan land values reveals extraordinary concentration: five metro areas (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston) hold 48% of all US urban land value despite representing much smaller shares of population or GDP. Total urban land values exceed twice national GDP, reflecting both productivity differences and quality-of-life amenities. Crucially, Albouy (2016) demonstrates that wage and housing cost differences primarily reflect productivity rather than amenities—high housing costs in San Francisco mainly capitalize higher wages from agglomeration, not just pleasant weather. This matters normatively because productivity-based land values arguably result from positive externalities and public investment, raising questions about whether current residents can legitimately claim exclusive rights to value they did not individually create.

Moretti's (2011) general equilibrium framework reveals how housing supply elasticity determines whether agglomeration benefits manifest as population growth or price increases. In cities with elastic housing supply, demand shocks from productivity growth create building booms—more people can access opportunity-rich locations. In cities with inelastic supply, the same productivity growth generates housing price increases that prevent access, concentrating benefits among existing residents who capture gains through property appreciation rather than sharing them through population growth. This mechanism directly links housing policy to distributional justice: exclusionary regulation transforms agglomeration economies from potentially broadly-shared opportunities into private gains for incumbent property owners.

### Housing Supply Constraints and Spatial Misallocation

Geographic and regulatory constraints combine to create housing supply inelasticity in precisely the most productive cities. Saiz's (2010) analysis using satellite data to measure developable land shows that geographic features—steep slopes exceeding 15 degrees, oceans, wetlands—strongly predict supply inelasticity. The most constrained markets (San Francisco, Miami, New York) face severe natural limits. However, regulation interacts with geography: land-constrained cities tend to adopt stricter regulations, amplifying natural scarcity. Gyourko et al.'s (2008) Wharton Residential Land Use Regulatory Index documents substantial variation in regulatory stringency across 2,000+ jurisdictions, with highly regulated communities featuring multiple approval entities, strict density controls, substantial impact fees, and permitting processes exceeding six months. Importantly, regulation is not randomly distributed—it correlates with coastal location, high home prices, educated populations, and slow historical growth, suggesting endogenous political economy dynamics.

The consequences are severe. Glaeser and Gyourko (2018) demonstrate that supply elasticity determines how urban success manifests: during the 1980s boom, the most inelastic metro areas saw 29% price growth versus only 3.4% in the most elastic markets for equivalent demand shocks. Employment responds less in supply-constrained locations: Saks (2008) finds employment growth approximately 20% lower in highly regulated places compared to unconstrained markets facing equal labor demand shocks. If all metropolitan areas were as elastic as the median, the US housing stock would be 15 million units larger (Glaeser and Gyourko 2018).

Hsieh and Moretti's (2019) landmark study quantifies the aggregate economic costs of spatial misallocation. Using a spatial equilibrium model with 220 metropolitan areas from 1964-2009, they show that housing supply constraints in just three cities—New York, San Francisco, and San Jose—reduced US GDP growth by 36% over this 45-year period. The mechanism is direct: high-productivity cities adopted stringent zoning and land use regulations limiting housing supply, which raised housing costs and prevented workers from migrating to where they would be more productive. Lowering constraints in these three cities to the median would increase GDP by 8.9%. This is not a marginal efficiency loss but a first-order drag on national economic growth and individual opportunity. Workers who would thrive in productive urban environments cannot access them due to exclusionary housing policies.

Gyourko and Molloy's (2015) comprehensive review establishes that regulation's political economy primarily reflects homeowner interests protecting property values—the "homevoter hypothesis" (Fischel 2001). Homeowners dominate local government because, unlike diversified corporate shareholders, they hold most wealth in single illiquid assets making them intensely focused on local policies affecting home values. They rationally support restrictive zoning that raises property values by limiting supply, even though this imposes substantial costs on would-be residents and aggregate welfare. Once enacted, regulation tends to persist and strengthen—a ratchet effect where restrictions become institutionally entrenched. The regulatory frontier is closing: even sunbelt cities historically known for elastic supply are now adopting restrictive regulations, potentially worsening affordability nationwide.

### Path Dependency and Spatial Lock-In

Past decisions create persistent spatial configurations that constrain present justice even when those decisions were not themselves unjust. Baum-Snow's (2007) analysis using planned 1947 Interstate Highway routes as exogenous variation demonstrates that each highway ray passing through a central city reduced its population by approximately 18%. The Interstate System enabled suburbanization by reducing commuting costs, and this suburban development pattern persists today despite changing preferences for urban living. The infrastructure cannot easily be removed, suburban investments are sunk, and spatial lock-in makes reversing these patterns extraordinarily difficult and expensive.

Regulatory path dependency compounds infrastructure lock-in. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) document that regulation, once adopted, rarely relaxes and often strengthens. High-income coastal states that adopted strict land use controls in the 1970s-80s have maintained and expanded those regulations. This creates temporal injustice: current generations inherit regulatory frameworks enacted before they could vote, limiting their housing options in productive cities.

Ganong and Shoag's (2017) analysis reveals the distributional consequences of spatial lock-in. US states experienced steady income convergence from 1880-1980 at approximately 1.8% annually as workers migrated from low-wage to high-wage states. This century-long convergence stopped after 1980. The mechanism: land-use restrictions in high-income states raised housing costs, creating barriers preventing low-skilled workers from migrating to opportunity while high-skilled workers could still afford to move. Migration from low-wage to high-wage states drove 40-75% of historical convergence, but after 1980, high housing costs make this mobility worthwhile only for high-earners. Attorneys can afford to move to expensive coastal cities where housing consumes 21% of income, but janitors cannot when rent would consume 52% of earnings. This asymmetry means housing costs now prevent precisely those workers who would benefit most from accessing high-wage regions, exacerbating rather than reducing inequality.

Autor et al.'s (2013) analysis of Chinese import competition's local labor market effects demonstrates spatial lock-in's persistence. Manufacturing job losses from trade created large persistent effects on unemployment, labor force participation, and wages in exposed commuting zones. Transfer payments (unemployment insurance, disability, retirement benefits, healthcare assistance) rose sharply in trade-exposed areas, indicating that adjustment costs are substantial and long-lasting. Workers in declining regions face barriers relocating to growing areas—partly due to housing costs in growing cities (Ganong and Shoag 2017), partly due to place attachment and community ties. They are trapped between disappearing opportunities in manufacturing regions and inaccessible opportunities in expensive coastal cities.

### Gentrification, Sorting, and Displacement Evidence

Couture et al.'s (2019) analysis of income-based spatial sorting shows how rising incomes manifest geographically. A 10% metropolitan income increase associates with a 13% increase in affluent households living in downtown areas. Rising incomes of the rich explain approximately 50% of the "rich urbanization" and "poor suburbanization" patterns observed since 1980. Poor households either face displacement or pay higher rents for amenities they value less than wealthier incoming residents value them. Income inequality drives spatial sorting with distributional consequences concentrated on lower-income households.

The empirical evidence on gentrification-induced displacement is more nuanced than simple narratives suggest. Ellen and O'Regan (2011), tracking individual homeowners through 1990s neighborhood change using confidential Census data, find no heightened displacement of original residents, even among the most vulnerable. Income gains came from higher-income in-migration, selective exit of lower-income residents, and income gains by original residents. Importantly, original residents reported greater neighborhood satisfaction improvements than those in persistently low-income areas. Dragan et al. (2020), using longitudinal NYC Medicaid records tracking low-income children from 2009-2015, similarly find no evidence that gentrification meaningfully increases mobility rates, though moves that do occur tend to be longer-distance. Children starting in gentrifying areas experience larger residential environment improvements (lower poverty rates, better schools) than counterparts in persistently low-SES areas.

However, these findings require careful interpretation. Both studies focus on either homeowners (Ellen and O'Regan) or very low-income Medicaid-eligible families (Dragan et al.), potentially missing displacement of working-class renters who are neither homeowners nor poor enough for Medicaid. The time periods (1990s, 2009-2015) and location (NYC with rent regulation) may not generalize to more recent gentrification waves in less-regulated markets. Methodological challenges persist: tracking people who leave neighborhoods is inherently difficult, potentially biasing against finding displacement. Aggregate neighborhood improvements do not address whether benefits are fairly distributed or whether more egalitarian improvements were possible. The critical gentrification studies tradition (Lees et al. 2008, Slater 2006) argues that displacement research has been marginalized as attention shifted to gentrification's benefits, creating an "eviction of critical perspectives" that mirrors the physical eviction of low-income residents.

### Normative Implications

The economic evidence establishes three crucial points for normative theory. First, location-specific value is real and enormous. Agglomeration effects create productivity gains of 2-5% from doubling city size, concentrated urban land values exceed $2 trillion, and wage premiums in productive cities reach 10-30%. This is not speculation or noise but fundamental economic reality making location non-fungible. Second, this value is largely socially created rather than individually produced. Agglomeration arises from positive externalities of density, public infrastructure investment, and thick labor markets—not from individual landowners' efforts. This raises questions about who legitimately claims these gains. Third, current allocation mechanisms—housing markets operating under exclusionary regulation—prevent efficient access and entrench inequality. Housing constraints reduced US GDP growth by 36% while halting regional income convergence and blocking low-income mobility to opportunity.

These findings transform the normative landscape for housing justice. Exclusionary housing policies are not merely redistributive (transferring opportunity from newcomers to incumbents) but destructive (preventing value creation and aggregate opportunity). The efficiency losses (36% GDP reduction) suggest these policies are not Pareto-optimal local control but welfare-destroying exclusion. The distributional pattern (blocking low-skilled workers while accommodating high-skilled) exacerbates inequality rather than simply reflecting market outcomes. The path dependency (regulations from decades ago constraining current mobility) creates temporal injustice where present generations inherit spatial configurations limiting their choices. How housing justice philosophy engages with these empirical realities is the subject of the next section.
