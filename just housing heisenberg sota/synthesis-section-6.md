## Section 6: Housing Justice and the Gentrification Debate

### Right to Housing Frameworks

Philosophical work on housing justice has developed multiple frameworks for why housing deserves special protection beyond ordinary market goods. Waldron's (1991) foundational analysis establishes homelessness as a freedom problem rather than merely resource deficit. Everything that is done must be done somewhere, and no one is free to perform an action unless there is somewhere they are free to perform it. Homeless people lack freedom because they have no space under exclusive control where basic life activities can be performed without permission. Private property and restrictive public space rules combine to make exercise of basic freedoms effectively impossible for those without housing. Essert (2016) develops this insight, arguing that homelessness should be understood as lack of property rights—specifically, lack of any territorial security. The solution requires conferring property rights, not just providing shelter, because property rights uniquely solve the domination and dependence problem by creating a sphere of exclusive control.

Wells's (2016, 2019) Rawlsian framework proposes limited property rights for housing that look more like lease rights than full ownership. Basic justice requires "lease rights" over self-contained living space for minimum three years duration. The right includes living alone (not forced into communal housing) when resources permit. This is more limited than traditional ownership—lacking perpetual duration and alienation rights—but provides the security necessary for life planning. The three-year temporal threshold ensures sufficient stability while remaining more realistic than claims to indefinite ownership. Wells's proposal demonstrates how property theory can ground housing security without requiring full ownership, particularly relevant for tenant protections in rental markets where most urban low-income residents live.

Radin's (1982) personhood theory provides philosophical foundation for why homes deserve stronger property protections than fungible goods. Certain property is "personal"—bound up with identity and self-development—deserving more robust legal protection than "fungible" property held purely instrumentally. Homes are paradigmatic personal property because of their constitutive role in self-development, relationships, and life projects. Long-term residence makes housing personal property meriting enhanced protection against dispossession. This framework supports tenant protections grounded not in welfare or efficiency but in property's relationship to personhood.

Dummer and Neuhäuser's (2025) refined capabilities approach addresses limitations in Nussbaum's sufficientarian framework. Housing has positional and relational dimensions beyond absolute quality thresholds. Segregation by income or race affects capabilities even when housing meets minimum standards because self-respect depends on comparative status and social bases of recognition. Concentrated poverty undermines capabilities through peer effects, reduced access to opportunity networks, and stigmatization, regardless of individual housing unit quality. This relational turn in capabilities theory connects to Anderson's (1999) democratic equality framework, suggesting housing justice requires not just minimum provision but attention to how residential patterns enable or undermine equal social relations.

### Structural Injustice Frameworks

Young's (2011) social connection model shifts focus from individual rights to systemic patterns. Her paradigmatic case is Sandy, a single mother facing homelessness when her building converts to condominiums. Sandy's homelessness results from many actors' actions constituting housing markets and policy contexts, with none doing anything particularly reprehensible individually. Structural injustice exists when social processes systematically threaten groups with domination or deprivation while enabling others' expanded opportunities. All who contribute to structural processes producing injustice have political responsibility to remedy it—responsibility that is collective, forward-looking, and focused on changing structures rather than assigning individual blame.

Shelby's (2016) analysis of "dark ghettos" applies Rawlsian justice principles to spatial structures. Racially segregated, economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods constitute symptoms of systemic injustice in America's basic structure, not cultural pathologies or mere unfortunate outcomes. Segregated ghettos violate reciprocity (mutual benefit from social cooperation), fair equality of opportunity (equal prospects for those with equal talents and motivation), and civic equality (relating as political equals). The injustice lies in basic institutional structures—discrimination in labor and housing markets, segregated education, wealth inequality—not in ghetto residents themselves. Shelby's framework treats spatial arrangements as fundamental components of society's basic structure subject to justice principles, requiring systemic reform rather than targeted neighborhood interventions.

Anderson's (2010) integration imperative establishes residential segregation as the fundamental cause of persistent African American disadvantage across virtually all well-being dimensions. Integration is both moral and democratic imperative because segregation perpetuates inequality in education, employment, wealth accumulation, health, and political power through multiple interlocking mechanisms. This creates profound tension with community protection arguments: achieving integration may require overriding incumbent preferences, disrupting established communities, and enabling neighborhood demographic change that longtime residents resist. Anderson's empirical case for integration's importance is compelling, but it conflicts directly with occupancy rights frameworks emphasizing incumbent protection.

### Political Economy Critiques

Harvey's (2008) Marxist "right to the city" fundamentally challenges liberal rights frameworks. Urbanization under capitalism systematically extracts surplus from working classes while control over urban development lies with capital and property speculators. The right to the city is not merely access to urban resources but an "active right to make the city different"—a collective right to reshape urbanization processes democratically according to human needs rather than profit imperatives. Gentrification represents class dispossession, extracting value from working-class neighborhoods while displacing residents to serve capital accumulation. Liberal rights approaches, Harvey argues, treat symptoms (unequal housing access) without addressing causes (commodification, property relations, capitalism itself).

Madden and Marcuse's (2016) analysis frames housing crisis as rooted in commodification and financialization, not policy failures. "Hypercommodification" makes luxury real estate and displacement two sides of the same process—both serve financial speculation and capital accumulation. Housing crisis is a feature of financialized capitalism, not a bug fixable through policy tweaks. Decommodification—removing housing from market logic—is required, not just affordability programs that leave market mechanisms intact. Aalbers (2016) extends this analysis, showing how financialization represents structural transformation where housing becomes "High-Quality Collateral" for global capital. States actively create conditions for financial actors to dominate housing provision through "regulated deregulation," restructuring to favor finance over residents. Dancygier and Saunders (2025) provide empirical evidence that publics recognize this: Germans experiencing housing financialization express fundamental rejection of treating housing as speculative asset, viewing it instead as social right and holding states responsible for provision.

Erck's (2024) limitarian approach applies Robeyns's framework to housing: it is morally wrong to have too much housing while others lack enough. Multiple-property ownership by individuals and corporations contributes to housing scarcity and unaffordability. Housing wealth ceilings would complement lower-bound rights to housing, constraining excessive accumulation. This approach addresses housing justice from the upper bound—limiting hoarding—rather than only ensuring minimum provision, connecting to financialization critiques of housing as speculative asset.

### Gentrification's Multidimensional Wrongfulness

Recent work identifies multiple dimensions of gentrification's harm beyond simple displacement. Physical displacement—forced relocation of residents—is the most obvious harm. Krishnamurthy and Moore (2024) show how gentrification violates three place-based rights simultaneously: rights to a home (secure shelter), rights of residency (stable political membership), and place-based rights to community (valued relationships tied to place). This pluralistic account explains why displacement harms even when residents receive compensation—the three rights cannot be satisfied by money or equivalent housing elsewhere.

Lopez-Cantero's (2025) phenomenological displacement concept captures non-material harms affecting residents who remain physically but experience erosion of belonging and at-homeness. Symbolic displacement occurs when neighborhood transformation—familiar places closing, social networks dissolving, cultural markers disappearing—destroys the social world residents valued even without forcing them to move. These experiential losses constitute injustice inadequately addressed through compensation or even anti-displacement policies that keep residents in place physically while their neighborhood transforms around them.

Draper's (2024) democratic theory critique identifies gentrification's political harms: undermining everyday democratic communication. Gentrification damages democracy through two mechanisms. Community disintegration in low-income enclaves eliminates social networks and shared spaces for informal political discussion among longtime residents. Homogenization in mixed-income areas reduces diversity of perspectives and limits informal public sphere access as economic and cultural change favors affluent newcomers' preferences. Democratic harm occurs even without physical displacement—gentrification damages the informal political culture and deliberative capacity essential to democratic citizenship.

Lloyd's (2023) Lockean argument grounds incumbent claims in collective labor creating community goods. Long-term residents have labored together to create valuable community objects—social networks, cultural institutions, mutual aid relationships, neighborhood practices. Gentrification appropriates these collectively-created goods for newcomers' benefit without compensating creators. Extending Walzer's spheres of justice, Lloyd argues community goods constitute a separate sphere deserving protection from market dominance. This collective creation framework provides grounds for incumbent claims beyond individual autonomy or property, emphasizing shared investment over time.

### The Integration-Community Stability Tension

The deepest unresolved tension in housing justice literature concerns reconciling integration imperatives with community protection. Anderson's (2010) integration priority argues that segregation perpetuates inequality across all dimensions—education, employment, wealth, health, political power. Residential integration is morally and democratically necessary even when it requires overriding incumbent preferences that maintain segregation. Breaking down segregated patterns justifies policies enabling neighborhood demographic change including gentrification that brings mixed-income residents into formerly low-income areas.

Place-protection theorists (Huber and Wolkenstein 2018, Lloyd 2023, Krishnamurthy and Moore 2024) emphasize that occupancy rights, community goods, and located life plans deserve protection from displacement. Gentrification wrongs incumbent residents by disrupting place-based attachments and community relationships built over time. However, strong incumbent protection risks entrenching segregation when protected communities are racially or economically homogeneous. If residents have rights to preserve neighborhood character and resist demographic change, how can integration occur?

Kogelmann's (2025) analysis reveals that autonomy arguments generate this tension. Anti-gentrification advocates cite displacement's autonomy violations—forced relocation disrupts residents' capacity to pursue chosen life plans. Pro-zoning advocates cite homeowners' autonomy to control their property and neighborhood character—exclusionary zoning protects residents' choices about community composition. The same normative principle (autonomy) yields opposed policy conclusions (anti-displacement protection vs. exclusionary zoning), suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate the incumbent-newcomer conflict. This reveals a fundamental theoretical gap: we lack principles for determining when incumbent autonomy interests override access rights and vice versa.

### Empirical Complexity and Normative Assessment

The empirical evidence on displacement reviewed in Section 5 complicates normative assessment. If original low-income residents often remain in gentrifying neighborhoods and report improved satisfaction (Ellen and O'Regan 2011, Dragan et al. 2020), does this vindicate gentrification against displacement critiques? The answer is complex. First, even if many residents benefit from remaining, those who are displaced still suffer wrongful harm—aggregate improvements don't justify individual injustices. Second, non-displacement harms (phenomenological displacement, democratic damage, community dissolution) persist even when residents remain physically. Third, empirical studies may miss displacement of working-class renters, focusing on very low-income (Medicaid) or homeowners while the middle is squeezed out. Fourth, normative assessment cannot reduce to preference satisfaction—residents might adapt preferences to limited options (adaptive preferences problem), or improvements might be unequally distributed within staying populations.

The housing justice literature reveals rich normative frameworks but persistent theoretical gaps. Multiple dimensions of injustice (distributive, recognitional, procedural, relational, structural) apply to housing simultaneously, yet we lack principles for integrating them. Temporal claims create especially difficult tradeoffs: incumbent occupancy versus newcomer access, historical claims versus current needs, community stability versus integration imperatives. Different frameworks (rights-based, capabilities, structural injustice, political economy) identify different problems and generate different solutions. What research gaps remain, and how might they be addressed? Section 7 synthesizes these into a forward-looking research agenda.
