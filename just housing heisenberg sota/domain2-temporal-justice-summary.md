## Executive Summary

This domain is **CENTRAL** to the housing justice research project. The core challenge—adjudicating between incumbent residents' claims based on past occupancy versus newcomers' claims based on present/future need—is precisely a temporal justice problem. The literature provides sophisticated conceptual frameworks for analyzing how justice applies across time, how historical injustices persist or supersede, and how temporal attachment generates moral claims.

**Key insight:** The field has moved from abstract philosophical puzzles to urgent practical applications (climate justice, territorial rights, gentrification) with significant recent work (2015-2025) directly applicable to housing.

## Key Papers and Arguments

### Foundational Works on Supersession (Historical Claims Over Time)

**1. Waldron (1992) - "Superseding Historic Injustice"** [CRITICAL]
- **The supersession thesis:** Changed circumstances can make rectification of historical injustice unjust or impermissible
- **Example:** Indigenous land claims may be superseded by population growth and changed resource needs
- **Housing application:** If true, incumbent residents' claims could be superseded by newcomers' housing needs
- **Status:** Highly influential but contested; sets terms of debate

**2. Meyer & Waligore (2022) - Special Issue on Supersession** [CRITICAL]
- **Refines supersession:** Distinguishes partial/full, dormant/final supersession
- **Critical assessments:** Includes Indigenous perspectives, settler colonial theory critiques
- **Housing application:** Provides nuanced framework for analyzing when displacement wrongs persist vs. when circumstances have changed enough to alter justice requirements
- **Key insight:** Don't simply ask "does supersession hold?" but "what kind, under what conditions, for how long?"

**3. Thompson (2002) - "Taking Responsibility for the Past"** [ANTI-SUPERSESSION]
- **Core argument:** Historical injustices create enduring obligations across generations
- **Mechanism:** Political societies must repair predecessors' injustices to maintain justice
- **Housing application:** Past displacement (redlining, urban renewal) creates persistent claims for current descendants
- **Position:** Robust anti-supersession—history doesn't fade away with changed circumstances

### Occupancy Rights Theory (Temporal Attachment to Place)

**4. Stilz (2013, 2019) - Occupancy Rights** [CRITICAL FOR HOUSING]
- **Core concept:** People have moral claims to places where they reside, participate, and plan lives
- **Key feature:** Rights don't depend on historically "clean" title—can arise even after unjust origins
- **Temporal dimension:** Occupancy strengthens over time through deepening attachment
- **Housing application:** Longtime renters have genuine occupancy rights even without ownership; displacement is wrong because it violates these place-based temporal claims
- **Critical innovation:** Separates occupancy (location-specific, temporally acquired) from property (transferable, ownership-based)

**5. Moore (2015) - "A Political Theory of Territory"** [CRITICAL FOR HOUSING]
- **Core argument:** Peoples acquire territorial rights through legitimate occupancy and self-determination
- **Three foundations:** Individual residency rights + collective occupancy rights + self-determination
- **Temporal aspect:** Longer occupancy strengthens claims, but time doesn't automatically erase past injustice
- **Housing application:** Neighborhoods as territories; residential communities have collective self-determination interests; gentrification threatens territorial control

**6. Krishnamurthy & Moore (2024) - "What Makes Gentrification Wrong?"** [MOST DIRECTLY RELEVANT!]
- **Three place-based rights violated:** (1) home, (2) residency, (3) community
- **Temporal dimension:** All three rights strengthen over time through lived experience, relationships, investment
- **Housing application:** DIRECTLY addresses gentrification philosophically; provides framework specifically for displacement wrongs
- **Critical insight:** Not just about property/distribution—about place-specific rights that accrue temporally

### Intergenerational Justice (Obligations Across Time)

**7. Gosseries (2023) - "What Is Intergenerational Justice?"** [COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK]
- **Central challenge:** Temporal non-overlap—generations don't coexist, can't reciprocate
- **Non-identity problem:** Future people's identities depend on our actions
- **Housing application:** Housing policy affects not just current residents but future generations (who will live in neighborhoods, legacy of communities)

**8. Caney (2014) - Climate Justice and Temporal Discounting**
- **Core argument:** Pure temporal discounting is morally arbitrary—when people exist doesn't affect their moral status
- **Housing application:** Future residents' needs shouldn't be discounted compared to current residents' attachment
- **Challenge:** Epistemic uncertainty about future (who will live where?) complicates this

**9. Bidadanure (2021) - Age-Group Justice**
- **Framework:** Combines complete-life egalitarianism with moment-in-time relational equality
- **Key distinction:** Temporary age-group inequalities (everyone experiences across life) vs. generational inequalities (cohort permanently disadvantaged)
- **Housing application:** Young adults priced out face both types; assessment requires both synchronic and diachronic evaluation

### Rectification and Historical Injustice

**10. Butt (2009, 2012) - Rectifying International Injustice**
- **Three temporal connections:** Benefit (current actors gained from past injustice), entitlement (wrongful taking), responsibility (succession to wrongdoing institutions)
- **Housing application:** Current property values reflect historical injustice; displaced communities have entitlement claims; cities bear institutional responsibility
- **Practical framework:** Distinguishes restitution (return what was taken) from compensation (equivalent value)

**11. Luoma & Moore (2024) - "Rectifying Historical Territorial Injustices"**
- **Three problems:** Continuity (are current claimants same agents?), Particularity (why this specific place?), Distributive Justice (balance historical claims vs. current needs?)
- **Housing application:** Displaced residents vs. current occupants vs. newcomers—three-way temporal tension
- **Recommendation:** Occupancy theory better than pure historical entitlement, but rectification still required

**12. Truccone (2024) - "The Temporal Dimension of Justice"** [SYNTHETIC]
- **Core question:** Should historical injustices always be repaired?
- **Answer:** Reconcile reparative (backward-looking) and distributive (forward-looking) justice—don't choose between them
- **Four aspects:** (1) temporal dimension itself, (2) connections between current/past actors, (3) changed circumstances, (4) appropriate reparation forms
- **Housing application:** Don't simply choose displaced residents' claims vs. newcomers' needs—integrate both

### Other Important Works

**13. Goodin (2010) - Temporal Justice**
- Introduces "temporal justice" concept—justice extends to time/discretionary time
- Housing affects temporal autonomy (commute times, life-course planning, temporal security)

**14. Miller (2007) - National Responsibility**
- Collective agents (nations, cities) have temporal continuity enabling historical responsibility
- Cities bear responsibility for past housing injustices as continuous institutions

**15. Ypi (2013) - "What's Wrong with Colonialism"**
- Injustice as relational—domination and exclusion from equal participation
- Gentrification as relational wrong (forced into new association without consent)

**16. Nine (2022) - "Sharing Territories"**
- Overlapping territorial claims rather than exclusive sovereignty
- Multiple groups with different temporal depths of claim can share governance

## Major Theoretical Positions Identified

### 1. Historical Supersession (5 papers)
**Representatives:** Waldron (1992), Armstrong (2015)
**Core claim:** Changed circumstances can supersede historical injustice claims
**Housing implication:** Incumbent claims could be overridden by newcomer needs when circumstances change
**Status:** Influential but heavily contested

### 2. Anti-Supersession / Persistent Claims (4 papers)
**Representatives:** Thompson (2002), Butt (2009, 2012), Meyer & Waligore (2022)
**Core claim:** Historical injustices create enduring obligations across generations
**Housing implication:** Past displacement creates persistent claims even if neighborhood has changed
**Status:** Strong philosophical arguments, practically challenging

### 3. Occupancy Rights Theory (3 papers)
**Representatives:** Stilz (2013, 2019), Moore (2015), Krishnamurthy & Moore (2024)
**Core claim:** Temporal residence creates place-based moral claims independent of property ownership
**Housing implication:** Longtime residents (even renters) have occupancy rights; displacement wrongs them
**Status:** Rapidly developing, most promising for housing justice

### 4. Intergenerational Justice Theories (4 papers)
**Representatives:** Gosseries (2023), Caney (2014), Bidadanure (2021), Lippert-Rasmussen (2025)
**Core claim:** Justice spans generations; temporal location doesn't affect moral status
**Housing implication:** Must consider future residents' needs, not just current occupants
**Status:** Well-developed but abstract; needs housing-specific application

### 5. Temporal Framing / Diachronic Justice (3 papers)
**Representatives:** Goodin (2010), Truccone (2024), Cockburn (2025)
**Core claim:** How we frame time (moment vs. life-course vs. intergenerational) affects justice assessment
**Housing implication:** Housing justice looks different at different temporal scales
**Status:** Emerging methodological insight about temporal indeterminacy

### 6. Reconciliation Approaches (2 papers)
**Representatives:** Truccone (2024), Luoma & Moore (2024)
**Core claim:** Integrate backward-looking (reparative) and forward-looking (distributive) justice
**Housing implication:** Don't simply choose incumbents vs. newcomers—find principles for balancing
**Status:** Promising synthetic approach but underdeveloped operationally

## Gaps and Future Research Needs

### 1. Limited Urban Housing Application
**Gap:** Only Krishnamurthy & Moore (2024) directly addresses gentrification philosophically
**Need:** More work applying temporal justice frameworks to urban housing, rental markets, neighborhood change
**Opportunity:** Luoma & Moore (2024) on territorial injustice could extend to neighborhoods as territories

### 2. Temporal Justice + Located Goods Integration
**Gap:** Most work focuses on fungible resources (money, climate emissions) or abstract territory
**Need:** Specific treatment of how temporal justice applies to non-fungible, location-specific goods like housing
**Challenge:** Place-specificity creates particular claims (can't just compensate with equivalent elsewhere)

### 3. Empirical Operationalization
**Gap:** Philosophical concepts (occupancy rights, reasons-responsiveness, superseding circumstances) remain abstract
**Need:** Empirical criteria for when occupancy generates rights, what counts as "changed circumstances," threshold questions
**Opportunity:** The housing project's neuroimaging approach could inform temporal attachment measurement

### 4. Path Dependency - Normative Theory Underdeveloped
**Gap:** "Path dependency" used descriptively (legal, economic) but limited normative philosophical analysis
**Need:** When does path dependency create moral constraints? When should we break path-dependent patterns?
**Housing application:** Neighborhoods shaped by discriminatory policies—does path dependency create obligation to maintain community or obligation to transform?

### 5. Institutional Design for Temporal Justice
**Gap:** Rich theory, but limited practical mechanisms for implementing temporal justice
**Need:** Institutional innovations beyond climate assemblies—how to structure housing governance for temporal sensitivity?
**Examples needed:** Participatory budgeting across time horizons, representation for future residents, mechanisms for balancing temporal claims

### 6. Intersectionality and Temporal Claims
**Gap:** Limited attention to how temporal claims interact with race, class, migration status over time
**Need:** How do racialized displacement patterns affect temporal justice? Do migrants have different temporal claims than multi-generational residents?
**Critical question:** Does temporal priority (first-in-time) reinforce existing privilege or provide redress?

### 7. Short-term Rentals, Financialization, Demographic Change
**Gap:** Literature focuses on traditional territory/intergenerational issues, not contemporary housing dynamics
**Need:** How does platform capitalism (Airbnb) affect occupancy rights? What about housing as financial asset?
**New questions:** Temporal claims when neighborhoods rapidly flip, investors replace residents, digital nomads cycle through

## Connections to Other Domains

### Domain 1: Distributive Justice Foundations
**Connection:** Temporal dimension challenges pure time-slice principles (Rawls); historical entitlement theories (Nozick) require temporal analysis
**Integration needed:** How do sufficientarianism, prioritarianism, egalitarianism apply across time?

### Domain 3: Property Rights and Ownership
**Connection:** Occupancy rights distinct from but related to property; temporal acquisition of claims
**Tension:** Property (transferable) vs. occupancy (place-specific, temporally acquired)

### Domain 4: Community, Belonging, Displacement
**Connection:** Temporal dimension explains why displacement is distinctively wrong—severs accumulated connections
**Integration:** Relational goods (community) have temporal depth; disruption isn't just loss of current state but foreclosure of future

### Domain 5: Responsibility and Agency
**Connection:** Collective responsibility across time (Miller); temporal continuity of agents (cities, communities)
**Question:** Who bears responsibility for historical housing injustice when populations turn over?

## Key Insights for Housing Justice Project

### 1. Temporal Framing is Normatively Non-Neutral
Different time horizons support different conclusions. Housing justice assessment must explicitly choose or integrate:
- **Moment-in-time:** Newcomers need housing now (distributive priority)
- **Life-course:** Longtime residents have decades of investment (occupancy priority)
- **Intergenerational:** Displaced communities lost generational wealth (reparative priority)

### 2. Occupancy Rights Theory Most Promising
Stilz and Moore's occupancy framework provides strongest philosophical foundation for anti-displacement claims because:
- Doesn't require property ownership (protects renters)
- Independent of historical title (survives path dependency)
- Temporally acquired (explains why long-term residents have stronger claims)
- Place-specific (can't be satisfied with equivalent housing elsewhere)

### 3. Supersession Cannot Be Ignored
Even if we reject full supersession, the question persists: When do changed circumstances alter justice requirements?
- **Housing needs it:** Can't simply say "past claims always win"—must address changed demographics, housing crises, newcomer needs
- **Framework from Meyer & Waligore:** Partial supersession (some but not all claims persist), dormant supersession (claims can reassert)

### 4. Reconciliation Over Choice
Truccone's insight critical: Don't choose backward-looking (reparative) vs. forward-looking (distributive)—integrate both
- **Housing application:** Policies must simultaneously: (1) protect longtime residents from displacement, (2) provide newcomer access to opportunity-rich neighborhoods, (3) rectify historical injustices
- **Challenge:** Operationalizing this reconciliation—what specific policies achieve integration?

### 5. Three-Way Temporal Tension
Luoma & Moore identify the core problem:
1. **Historical claims:** Displaced former residents and descendants
2. **Current occupancy:** Longtime current residents
3. **Distributive needs:** Newcomers needing housing access

Housing justice must navigate all three, not just two-way incumbent vs. newcomer.

## Next Steps for Synthesis

1. **Integrate with Domain 1 (distributive justice):** How do temporal considerations modify Rawlsian, prioritarian, sufficientarian principles?

2. **Connect to Domain 4 (community/displacement):** Temporal depth explains special wrong of displacement—operationalize this

3. **Develop operational framework:** From abstract philosophy to housing policy—what specific principles emerge from temporal justice literature?

4. **Address three-way tension:** Historical claims + current occupancy + distributive needs—what weighting principles?

5. **Path dependency normative analysis:** When do historically unjust patterns create moral constraints vs. obligations to transform?

This domain provides essential conceptual infrastructure for the housing justice project's core challenge: adjudicating temporal claims across past, present, and future.
