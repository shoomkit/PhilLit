## Section 3: Temporal Justice and the Supersession Debate

### Waldron's Supersession Thesis

The temporal dimension of justice concerns how obligations and entitlements evolve across time. Waldron's (1992) "supersession thesis" provides the conceptual foundation for these debates: if a historical injustice occurs at time T1 creating an unjust distribution, morally relevant changes in circumstances can occur such that at time T2, justice no longer requires (and may prohibit) rectification to the original distribution. Waldron uses indigenous land claims as his paradigm case. Centuries after colonial dispossession, population has grown dramatically, environments have changed, and new generations with their own legitimate needs have emerged. Under these altered circumstances, restoring original territorial distributions might create new injustices by displacing current occupants who bear no responsibility for historical wrongs. The thesis holds that what was unjust at T1 may become not-unjust (or differently-unjust) at T2, not because the original wrong disappears or is forgiven, but because circumstances change what justice requires going forward.

Applied to housing, supersession raises profound questions. Does gentrification-induced displacement constitute "morally relevant changed circumstances" that supersede earlier residents' historical claims? When urban neighborhoods undergo demographic transformation, economic development, or infrastructure investment, do these changes override occupancy rights established through decades of residence? Alternatively, might displacement itself constitute an injustice creating new historical claims? The supersession debate directly addresses whether temporal priority in housing allocation has persistent moral weight or can be overridden when circumstances evolve.

### Anti-Supersession Responses and the Persistence of Historical Claims

Critics have developed sophisticated responses challenging Waldron's thesis. Thompson (2002) defends robust intergenerational obligations within political societies. Nations as temporally extended entities must keep commitments and repair injustices of predecessors; each generation inherits both benefits and burdens from the past. Displacement—whether through colonial dispossession or urban renewal—creates enduring moral debts that persist across generations. The moral relationship between political communities and affected populations does not simply decay with time. Thompson's framework suggests that historical housing injustices (redlining, contract buying, forced displacement, discriminatory lending) create persistent rectificatory obligations for contemporary cities and housing authorities, regardless of how much time has passed or how circumstances have changed.

Butt (2009, 2012) develops a more nuanced framework identifying three temporal connections that sustain rectificatory obligations across time: benefit (unjust enrichment where current parties profit from past wrongs), entitlement (wrongful taking where resources were illegitimately appropriated), and responsibility (institutional succession where current entities inherit obligations of predecessor institutions). Each connection generates distinct rectificatory duties even when direct causation is attenuated. Contemporary property distributions reflect accumulated injustice: current homeowners benefit from decades of discriminatory policies that channeled wealth to white suburban neighborhoods, displaced communities have entitlement claims to what was wrongfully taken, and cities bear responsibility as successors to institutions that perpetrated urban renewal and redlining. Butt's trichotomy provides analytical framework for tracing how historical wrongs generate present obligations even when specific victims and perpetrators no longer exist.

Meyer and Waligore's (2022) sophisticated conceptual analysis refines the supersession debate through crucial distinctions. They differentiate partial supersession (some but not all rectificatory claims are overridden) from full supersession (historical claims entirely disappear), and dormant supersession (claims temporarily inactive but can reassert if circumstances change again) from final supersession (claims permanently extinguished). These distinctions reveal supersession's complexity: perhaps gentrification partially supersedes incumbent claims (weakening them without eliminating them entirely), or produces dormant supersession where claims might reassert if neighborhood circumstances change again. The framework raises critical empirical and normative questions: what counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances"? How do we distinguish changes that legitimately supersede claims from those that merely make rectification inconvenient? The analytical apparatus provides tools for thinking through temporal housing claims with precision, but leaves the substantive criteria to be developed.

### Diachronic versus Synchronic Justice

Goodin's (2010) concept of "temporal justice" expands distributive justice beyond monetary resources to include time—specifically discretionary time over which individuals have autonomous control after necessary tasks. The magnitude of gaps between discretionary time enjoyed by best and worst off measures temporal injustice. This framework has direct housing implications: long commutes from affordable housing reduce discretionary time, gentrification-induced displacement disrupts temporal rhythms of community participation and family life, and housing stability provides temporal security for long-term planning. Housing allocation affects not merely what people have but their control over time and life-course trajectory. Should justice assessments focus on moment-in-time distributions (synchronic), life-course patterns (diachronic), or intergenerational comparisons?

Bidadanure (2021) develops age-group justice theory combining complete life egalitarianism, lifespan prudence, and relational egalitarianism. Some inequalities between age groups matter independently of their diachronic impact—relational reasons for equality exist at each life stage. She distinguishes temporary age-group inequalities (acceptable if everyone experiences them across their complete life) from generational inequalities (problematic when temporary inequalities become permanent cohort stratification). Applied to housing: young adults priced out of urban housing face both age-group inequality (synchronic comparison with older homeowners) and potential generational inequality (diachronic concern if they never recover access that previous generations enjoyed). Whether housing exclusion constitutes injustice depends on temporal framing: is it temporary life-stage variation where people eventually gain access, or permanent cohort stratification where entire generations are excluded from urban opportunities that their parents accessed? The temporal framing fundamentally shapes normative assessment.

Truccone's (2024) comprehensive treatment of temporal justice argues that circumstances change over time affecting what justice requires (acknowledging supersession's insight), but insists this must be reconciled with—not chosen over—reparative justice imperatives. The core challenge is integrating backward-looking concerns (repairing historical wrongs) with forward-looking priorities (meeting current and future needs). Applied to housing, this means reconciling displaced communities' historical claims with current residents' established attachments and future generations' housing needs. Truccone's four-aspect framework structures analysis: (1) how does time itself affect justice requirements? (2) what connections link current actors to past injustices? (3) when do changed circumstances alter obligations? (4) what forms of reparation are appropriate? His synthesis approach refuses the false choice between reparative and distributive justice, insisting both must be integrated in temporal justice frameworks.

### Path Dependency and Moral Lock-In

Beyond direct historical injustice claims, path dependency creates distinctive temporal constraints on justice. Past decisions constrain present options even when those decisions were not themselves unjust. Baum-Snow's (2007) finding that each Interstate Highway ray through a central city reduced its population approximately 18% demonstrates how 1950s-70s infrastructure investments created suburban development patterns persisting today. These highways cannot easily be removed, suburban investment is sunk, and spatial configurations are locked in. Similarly, zoning regulations enacted decades ago continue shaping current housing markets. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) document that regulation, once adopted, tends to persist and strengthen—a ratchet effect where restrictive policies become institutionally entrenched even as circumstances change.

This raises a distinct normative question: does path dependency create obligations even absent direct historical wrongdoing? When current generations inherit spatial configurations that limit their choices—highway networks from the 1960s, zoning from the 1970s, segregated neighborhood patterns from redlining—do they have obligations to correct inherited spatial lock-in? The moral status of path-dependent constraints differs from explicit historical injustice but still shapes current opportunity structures. Ganong and Shoag's (2017) demonstration that land-use restrictions halted regional income convergence after 1980 shows how past regulatory choices constrain present mobility and opportunity for those who had no voice in those decisions. This suggests a category of "structural historical obligations" distinct from direct rectification: duties to address how inherited spatial configurations limit present justice, regardless of whether those configurations resulted from wrongful intent.

### Temporal Discounting and Intergenerational Claims

Caney's (2014) analysis of climate justice provides conceptual resources for housing's temporal dimension. Pure time discounting—discounting future people's interests simply because they exist later—constitutes unjust discrimination based on when people are alive. Temporal location should not affect moral weight. Applied to housing: should future residents' needs be discounted compared to current residents' attachment? Future generations will need housing in productive cities just as current generations do, yet political systems systematically favor current residents' interests (protection of property values, neighborhood character) over future needs (affordable housing access, climate-safe locations). Caney's argument against temporal discrimination suggests this asymmetry is unjust. However, epistemic uncertainty about the future complicates this: we know current residents' attachments and needs with certainty but must speculate about who will live where and what their needs will be.

Gosseries' (2023) comprehensive treatment of intergenerational justice emphasizes the challenge of temporal non-overlap: generations existing at different times cannot reciprocate, cooperate, or contract with each other. Yet housing policy inherently involves intergenerational claims. Current exclusionary zoning shapes opportunity structures for generations not yet born. Climate change will displace millions, creating housing needs in safe cities where current residents resist newcomers (Stilz 2024). Luoma and Moore (2024) argue that occupancy theory better handles rectification than pure historical entitlement precisely because current occupancy generates claims even without clean historical title—but historical injustice still matters for determining rectification duties. The temporal complexity is irreducible: we must weigh current occupancy claims, historical displacement, and future housing needs simultaneously, each operating on different temporal scales with different epistemic accessibility.

The supersession debate reveals that temporal justice for housing cannot simply apply timeless principles. How we frame the temporal scope of analysis—moment-in-time, life-course, intergenerational—fundamentally affects what justice requires. Historical claims persist through connections (benefit, entitlement, responsibility) but may be partial, dormant, or conditional depending on changed circumstances. Path dependency creates structural constraints even without direct wrongdoing. These temporal complexities demand frameworks that explicitly integrate past, present, and future—a challenge that occupancy rights theory addresses by grounding claims in temporally-established attachment to place.
