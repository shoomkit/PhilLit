DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:

This domain examines the ethics of housing allocation, gentrification, and displacement through multiple lenses: political philosophy, urban studies, and applied ethics. The field has experienced rapid growth since 2010, driven by escalating housing crises in major cities and increasing philosophical attention to urban justice.

Key debates center on whether housing is a special good deserving protection from market forces, what makes displacement wrongful, and how to balance competing claims between incumbent residents (who have established place-based attachments and community ties) and newcomers (who seek access to opportunity-rich neighborhoods). Recent work (2020-2025) has increasingly focused on autonomy-based accounts of displacement harms, with philosophers arguing that gentrification violates "occupancy rights" grounded in people's "located life plans" (Huber & Wolkenstein 2018; van Leeuwen 2025).

The literature reveals sharp divisions between critical scholars who view gentrification as inherently unjust displacement and those who emphasize its potential benefits (neighborhood revitalization, reduced segregation, economic development). Philosophical accounts increasingly move beyond simple utilitarianism to examine non-material harms (loss of community, phenomenological displacement, erosion of democratic spaces) and structural injustice frameworks. The financialization of housing has emerged as a major concern, with scholars examining how treating housing as a speculative asset conflicts with housing as a human right.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:

Housing justice provides a crucial domain for analyzing temporal claims in resource allocation. The core tension is temporal: incumbents assert rights based on historical presence, place-attachment, and community-building labor, while newcomers assert rights based on equal access and non-discrimination. This directly addresses the research question of how temporal priority interacts with distributive justice principles. The displacement literature also connects to climate migration ethics, as rising housing costs in climate-safe cities create conflicts between climate refugees and existing residents.

RECENT_DEVELOPMENTS:

The 2020-2025 period shows explosive growth in philosophical engagement with housing. Multiple papers published in top philosophy journals (Philosophy & Public Affairs, Journal of Applied Philosophy, Politics Philosophy & Economics) provide sophisticated normative frameworks. The COVID-19 eviction moratorium sparked renewed debate about tenant rights and property claims. Housing financialization scholarship has matured into a distinct sub-field linking political economy to normative theory. The capability approach and limitarianism have been applied to housing, expanding beyond traditional rights-based accounts.

NOTABLE_GAPS:

Despite growth, several gaps remain: (1) Limited engagement with exclusionary zoning's ethical dimensions from a philosophical perspective (more policy than normative theory); (2) Insufficient attention to the temporal structure of housing claims - most work focuses on synchronic distribution rather than diachronic entitlements; (3) Little philosophical work directly addressing climate migration and housing justice intersections; (4) Under-theorized tension between integration (Anderson) and place-protection (Huber & Wolkenstein); (5) Minimal engagement with comparative justice across cities/nations.

SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE:

For synthesis, distinguish between three levels of analysis: (1) Individual rights (Wells, Essert, Huber & Wolkenstein on occupancy rights, autonomy, and place-attachment); (2) Community goods (Lloyd, Draper on democratic communication and collective creation); (3) Structural injustice (Young, Shelby, Anderson on systemic patterns). The tension between incumbent protection and newcomer access is central. Consider how different normative frameworks (libertarian property rights, capability approach, structural injustice, right to housing) generate different policy prescriptions. Desmond's empirical work on eviction provides crucial grounding for philosophical theorizing.

KEY_POSITIONS:

- Pro-occupancy rights / Anti-gentrification: 8 papers - Emphasize place-attachment, autonomy, located life plans, community creation as grounds for incumbent protection (Huber & Wolkenstein, van Leeuwen, Lloyd, Lopez-Cantero)
- Right to housing advocates: 5 papers - Housing as human right or basic capability requiring state provision (Wells, Dummer & Neuhäuser, Madden & Marcuse, Desmond)
- Structural injustice theorists: 4 papers - Focus on systemic patterns, segregation, and basic structure reform (Young, Shelby, Anderson, Slater)
- Market critics / Financialization scholars: 3 papers - Examine commodification and financial speculation as injustice sources (Aalbers, Dancygier, Madden & Marcuse)
- Liberty-based approaches: 2 papers - Property rights and freedom as central (Essert, Christmas)
- Limitarianism: 1 paper - Excessive housing ownership as wrongful (Erck)
- Integration advocates: 1 paper - Prioritize breaking down segregation (Anderson)

  author = {van Leeuwen, Bart},
  title = {What is Wrong with Gentrification-Related Displacement?},
  journal = {Philosophy \& Social Criticism},
  year = {2025},

  number = {2},
  pages = {189--210},
  doi = {10.1177/03091325241289546},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Recent theorists claim physical displacement due to gentrification violates personal autonomy by disrupting "place-based" or "located life-plans." Van Leeuwen critically examines these autonomy-based objections, arguing they face significant challenges in explaining why displacement specifically is wrongful (rather than any involuntary relocation) and in distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate displacement. The paper scrutinizes whether autonomy accounts adequately capture displacement's distinctive wrongfulness. RELEVANCE: Provides most recent (2025) critical analysis of dominant autonomy-based frameworks for understanding gentrification harms. Directly engages with the temporal dimension of housing claims by examining how established residence creates place-based projects that merit protection. The critique helps refine which displacement harms are genuinely wrongful versus which reflect general housing scarcity problems. Critical for understanding limits of incumbent-protection arguments. POSITION: Critical examination of pro-occupancy rights autonomy arguments; identifies theoretical gaps in displacement ethics.},

  doi = {10.1177/1470594X18766818},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Gentrification is problematic insofar as it violates city-dwellers' "occupancy rights" - rights grounded in the importance of being able to pursue one's "located life plans." Drawing on Anna Stilz's concept of territorial occupancy rights, they argue that long-term residents develop attachments, projects, and relationships rooted in specific places that deserve protection. Limiting gentrification's impact does not require halting it entirely, but does require policies protecting vulnerable residents' ability to stay. RELEVANCE: Foundational paper applying territorial rights theory to urban contexts. Introduces "located life plans" concept that dominates recent displacement ethics. Provides sophisticated autonomy-based framework for incumbent protection that goes beyond simple property rights or welfare concerns. The temporal dimension (established residence creates normative claims) is central. Essential for understanding philosophical case for anti-displacement policies.

  doi = {10.1080/07352166.2023.2216889},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Moves beyond displacement-focused critiques to examine gentrification's broader harms, particularly loss of access to goods conferred by thriving local community membership. Develops Lockean argument that incumbent land users' occupancy rights are grounded in community members having "labored together to create objects of value." Also extends Michael Walzer's spheres of justice to incorporate community goods as separate sphere deserving protection from market logic. Provides "theoretically ecumenical" case against gentrification appealing to multiple traditions. RELEVANCE: Addresses displacement debate's limitations by focusing on collective/community dimensions rather than only individual autonomy. The "joint labor" argument provides temporal grounding for incumbent claims distinct from mere residence duration. Relevant to project's concern with temporal priority in resource allocation - communities create value over time that grounds claims. Shows how gentrification harms transcend individual displacement to include community dissolution. POSITION: Pro-occupancy rights; community goods and collective creation as grounds for anti-gentrification stance.},

  number = {1},
  pages = {3--28},
  doi = {10.1177/1470594X251330912},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines tension where autonomy arguments are used both to justify exclusionary zoning (homeowners' control over their property/neighborhood) and to critique gentrification (displacement violates residents' autonomy). Kogelmann analyzes this contradiction, showing that many who articulate gentrification's wrongness through autonomy inhibition also rely on autonomy to defend zoning restrictions that contribute to housing scarcity and affordability crises. Explores whether coherent autonomy-based housing policy is possible. RELEVANCE: Directly addresses core tension in housing justice: incumbent vs. newcomer claims. Shows how autonomy arguments cut both ways - protecting current residents may violate would-be residents' autonomy. Relevant to project's temporal claims analysis: does prior residence create stronger autonomy protection than equal access rights? The zoning connection reveals how incumbent protection at neighborhood level creates injustice at city/regional level. Essential for understanding autonomy's limitations as sole normative framework. POSITION: Critical analysis of autonomy-based arguments; reveals internal tensions in incumbent-protection theories.},

@book{desmond2016evicted,
  author = {Desmond, Matthew},
  title = {Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City},
  publisher = {Crown Publishers},
  address = {New York},
  year = {2016},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Based on ethnographic research, Desmond argues eviction is a cause, not just consequence, of poverty. Eviction destabilizes families, disrupts children's education, leads to job loss, and traps people in cycles of housing instability and exploitation. Documents how landlords profit from poor neighborhoods through serial eviction of vulnerable tenants. Makes explicit moral case that stable, affordable housing is central to human flourishing and economic mobility, advocating for universal housing vouchers and stronger tenant protections. RELEVANCE: Provides empirical grounding for philosophical debates about housing rights and eviction ethics. Won 2017 Pulitzer Prize and transformed public discourse on housing instability. Desmond's work informs normative arguments about right to housing and tenant protection. The exploitation framework (extracting value from poor households) connects to financialization critiques. Founded Eviction Lab creating first national eviction database. Essential empirical foundation for housing justice philosophy.

  doi = {10.4159/9780674969971},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes urban ghettos not as problems requiring targeted intervention but as symptoms of systemic injustice in America's basic structure. Argues that structural racism, segregated education, wealth inequality, and discrimination in labor, housing, and lending markets are fundamental causes of ghetto conditions. Critiques ameliorative approaches that ignore these root causes, calling instead for basic structure reform. Views ghetto residents as moral agents responding to injustice, not passive victims or cultural pathologies. RELEVANCE: Essential for understanding housing segregation's relationship to justice. Shelby's basic structure focus connects to Young's structural injustice framework and Anderson's integration arguments. Shows how residential segregation concentrates disadvantage and perpetuates racial inequality across generations. The housing discrimination analysis is crucial for understanding historical and ongoing barriers to fair housing access. Temporal dimension: segregation's persistence reflects accumulated injustice requiring systemic remedy.

  title = {The Right to the City},
  journal = {New Left Review},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {53},
  pages = {23--40},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops Marxist conception of "right to the city" as collective right to reshape urbanization processes. Argues urbanization under capitalism extracts surplus from working class while control over urban development lies with capital and property speculators. Right to city is not merely access to urban resources but "an active right to make the city different" through collective power to reshape urbanization. Critiques how urban restructuring (gentrification, displacement) serves accumulation and dispossession rather than human needs. RELEVANCE: Provides radical political economy framework distinct from liberal rights approaches. Anti-capitalist perspective on housing commodification and gentrification as class phenomena. Harvey's emphasis on collective/democratic control over urban space contrasts with individual occupancy rights approaches. The "common right" framing challenges individualist housing justice theories. Essential for understanding left critiques of market-based housing provision and financialization. Influential in housing justice movements globally. POSITION: Marxist political economy; anti-capitalist right to city as collective democratic control over urbanization.},

  author = {Fainstein, Susan S.},
  title = {The Just City},
  publisher = {Cornell University Press},
  address = {Ithaca, NY},
  year = {2010},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops urban theory of justice based on three pillars: equity (material well-being and resource distribution), diversity (tolerance for difference and variety in built environment), and democracy (meaningful participation in decision-making). Critiques dominant "communicative planning" paradigm's assumption that inclusive deliberation yields just outcomes, arguing structural inequalities among actors prevent procedural fairness from ensuring substantive justice. Draws on Rawls, Sen, Young, Harvey, and Nussbaum to develop pragmatic egalitarian approach to urban planning within capitalism. RELEVANCE: Major work integrating political philosophy with urban planning theory. The equity focus connects to distributive justice in housing allocation, while diversity pillar relates to integration/segregation debates. Emphasis on combining material equity with diversity matters for housing justice - not just how much housing but what kinds of neighborhoods. Skepticism about procedural approaches relevant to NIMBY/participation debates. Essential framework for evaluating just housing policy beyond simple affordability metrics. POSITION: Egalitarian urban justice theory; prioritizes equity, diversity, democracy as mutually necessary conditions for just cities.},

  publisher = {Princeton University Press},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  year = {2010},
  doi = {10.1515/9781400836468},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues racial residential segregation is fundamental cause of persistent African American disadvantage across virtually all well-being measures. Integration is moral and democratic imperative because segregation perpetuates inequality in education, employment, wealth accumulation, health, and political power. Advocates for integrationist policies including housing integration, affirmative action, and institutional reforms to dismantle systemic segregation. Grounds argument in nonideal theory addressing actual injustice rather than ideal theory. Blends empirical social science with political philosophy. RELEVANCE: Provides counterpoint to place-protection arguments - Anderson prioritizes breaking down segregation over protecting established communities. Creates tension with occupancy rights theories that may entrench segregation by protecting incumbent preferences. Essential for understanding integration vs. incumbent-protection tradeoff. The empirical evidence linking segregation to inequality is crucial for assessing segregation's wrongfulness. Temporal dimension: segregation's historical creation through discrimination requires active desegregation, not just ending discrimination. POSITION: Pro-integration; prioritizes breaking down segregation as requirement of racial justice even when requiring neighborhood change.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Defends distinctive right to housing that includes right to live alone (not just in communal housing). When individuals must live communally due to resource lack, their basic rights are violated. Develops freedom-based account of housing rights that addresses minimalism concerns in existing philosophical literature on homelessness. Argues housing right goes beyond mere shelter to include conditions enabling privacy, autonomy, and capacity to develop intimate relationships. Connects to broader work on associative freedom and freedom to disassociate. RELEVANCE: Sophisticated philosophical defense of housing as special good deserving rights protection. The privacy/autonomy argument shows housing's distinctiveness compared to other needs. Wells's freedom framework provides alternative to welfare-based or capability-based housing rights arguments. Relevant to right to housing vs. market allocation debate. The "right to live alone" claim is ambitious and contested - does housing scarcity mean some must accept shared housing? Essential for understanding philosophical foundations of housing rights claims. POSITION: Right to housing based on freedom/autonomy; housing rights include privacy and living alone.},

  pages = {266--295},
  doi = {10.1111/papa.12080},
  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues homelessness is distinctive condition constituted by lack of property rights, not merely lack of goods. To be homeless is to be under others' power - dominated by or dependent on them regarding where one may be. Property rights are justifiable because they uniquely solve homelessness by providing secure control over space. Contra critics, property rights don't create homelessness; without property rights everyone would be homeless (lacking secure place to be). Develops account of homelessness as legal/rights phenomenon, not just material deprivation. RELEVANCE: Provides libertarian/property-rights defense of housing security through radically different framework than welfare or capability approaches. Essert's analysis challenges left critiques of property by arguing property rights are necessary for solving homelessness. The "power over where one may be" framing reframes housing justice as about domination/subordination rather than distribution. Relevant to understanding minimal vs. expansive housing rights. Shows how different normative starting points (property vs. welfare) generate different housing justice theories.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines "capabilitarian assumption" in housing studies that housing justice should be analyzed through capability approach. Argues Nussbaum's sufficientarian capability account is inadequate for housing justice because it neglects positional and relational elements of housing - where one lives matters relative to others, not just absolute housing quality. Develops refined capability approach incorporating positional goods and self-respect concerns. Housing location affects comparative status and social bases of self-respect, requiring distributional principles beyond sufficiency. RELEVANCE: Latest (2025) application of capability approach to housing with important refinements. Shows limits of absolute standards when housing is positional good - segregation by income/race affects capabilities even when housing meets minimum quality. Connects to Anderson's integration arguments and relational equality theories. The self-respect dimension links housing to fundamental capabilities for equal citizenship. Addresses gap in housing ethics regarding relative vs. absolute standards. Relevant to project's distributional justice concerns.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes global housing crisis through political economy lens, arguing crisis has deep structural roots in housing's commodification and financialization requiring radical response beyond policy tweaks. Examines luxury real estate and gentrification as two sides of hypercommodification coin. Documents anti-gentrification activism, squatting, and housing movements as responses to displacement and exclusion. Critiques housing provision under capitalism as serving powerful property sector rather than public interest, advocating decommodification and right to housing. RELEVANCE: Major work linking political economy analysis to housing justice activism. Provides critical perspective on housing commodification distinct from philosophical rights theories. The gentrification-as-class-dispossession framework connects to Harvey's right to city and structural critiques. Essential for understanding radical housing justice movements and decommodification demands. Shows limits of market-based solutions to housing crisis.

Documents gentrification's evolution from localized phenomenon to state-led urban policy. Provides critical perspective challenging narratives that minimize displacement or celebrate gentrification as neighborhood "improvement." Establishes gentrification studies as distinct field bridging urban geography, sociology, and planning. RELEVANCE: Foundational text in gentrification studies providing empirical and theoretical grounding for philosophical analyses. The displacement documentation counters claims that gentrification doesn't cause residential displacement. Essential background for understanding what gentrification is empirically before assessing its ethics philosophically. The critical perspective influenced subsequent political philosophy work. Slater's contribution establishes "critical gentrification studies" tradition. Comprehensive international scope shows gentrification as global phenomenon requiring normative analysis.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Argues gentrification can harm residents at personal and emotional level even without physical displacement. Develops concept of "phenomenological displacement" as non-material harm where neighborhood change erodes sense of belonging and at-homeness. Residents experience symbolic displacement when familiar places transform, social networks dissolve, and cultural markers disappear. These non-material harms constitute injustice even when residents aren't forced to move and may receive compensation. Expands displacement concept beyond physical removal. RELEVANCE: Important expansion of displacement ethics beyond residential removal to include staying-but-alienated residents. The phenomenological approach captures harms missed by material/welfare frameworks and pure autonomy accounts. Relevant to temporal claims analysis: long-term residents experience place attachment and belonging that newcomers disrupt even without eviction. Shows limits of compensation for gentrification harms - can't fully remedy loss of social world. Essential for comprehensive account of gentrification's wrongfulness.

Slater's methodological critique reveals how research framing affects normative conclusions - studies focusing on aggregate neighborhood outcomes often miss individual displacement harms. Essential for understanding why displacement measurement is contested and politically charged.

RELEVANCE: Novel application of limitarianism to housing justice. Most housing ethics focuses on minimum provision (right to housing, homelessness); Erck examines maximum permissible holdings. Relevant to temporal claims project: does prior acquisition justify keeping multiple properties when others lack one? The sufficiency/excess framework challenges pure market allocation. Connects to financialization critiques - corporate multiple-property ownership as speculation. Addresses housing scarcity from supply side by limiting hoarding. POSITION: Limitarian approach; housing wealth ceilings complement right to housing to constrain inequality.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Diagnoses novel problem with gentrification beyond displacement: it hinders valuable everyday democratic communication. Gentrification has this effect through two mechanisms: (1) community disintegration in enclaves where long-term residents lose social networks and shared spaces for informal political discussion; (2) homogenization in public spaces where economic/cultural change reduces diversity of perspectives and informal public sphere access. Democratic harm occurs even without physical displacement. RELEVANCE: Expands gentrification critique to democratic theory domain. Shows collective/political harms beyond individual autonomy violations or welfare losses. The everyday democracy framework captures how neighborhood change affects informal political culture and deliberation crucial to democratic citizenship. Relevant to Fainstein's democracy pillar and Young's communicative democracy. Temporal dimension: established communities develop democratic practices over time that gentrification disrupts. Novel contribution identifying distinctively political harm. POSITION: Democratic theory critique; gentrification undermines everyday democratic communication through disintegration and homogenization.},

Provides critical assessment of gentrification research across disciplines, theories, methodologies, and geographic contexts. Establishes gentrification as mature field with distinct theoretical traditions, empirical methods, and policy implications. Documents evolution from localized urban phenomenon to global process. United Nations now recognizes gentrification as human rights issue. RELEVANCE: Definitive reference work synthesizing gentrification scholarship circa 2018. Essential for understanding field's scope, major debates, and research directions. Provides interdisciplinary perspective bridging geography, sociology, planning, and philosophy. The UN human rights recognition validates normative concerns about gentrification. Shows how empirical research on gentrification patterns, causes, and effects informs philosophical normative analysis. Establishes empirical consensus philosophers can draw upon.

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Develops "social connection model" of responsibility for structural injustice. Uses Sandy, single mother facing homelessness when building converts to condos, as example of structural housing injustice. Sandy's homelessness results from many people's actions constituting housing market and policy context, with none doing anything particularly reprehensible. Structural injustice exists when social processes systematically threaten large groups with domination or capability deprivation while enabling others' domination or expanded opportunities. All who contribute to structural processes producing injustice have political responsibility to remedy it. RELEVANCE: Foundational structural injustice framework applied directly to housing. Alternative to individual rights or aggregate welfare approaches - focuses on systemic patterns and collective responsibility. The housing example shows how markets and institutions generate injustice without individual wrongdoing. Forward-looking responsibility model (remedy injustice) rather than backward-looking (assign blame). Connects to Shelby's basic structure analysis. Essential for understanding systemic vs. individual responsibility for housing injustice. POSITION: Structural injustice framework; collective responsibility for systemic patterns causing housing insecurity.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Analyzes how housing financialization since 1970s contributed to debt transformation with serious consequences for macroeconomic instability, widening inequality, and rise of populism. Housing shifted from consumption good to financial asset class. Examines connections between housing markets, financial markets, and political economy. State policies actively facilitated financialization through deregulation, subsidies for homeownership, and financial innovation. Housing financialization drives wealth inequality and economic vulnerability. RELEVANCE: Provides institutional political economy analysis linking housing to broader economic/political transformations. Shows how housing financialization isn't natural market evolution but political choice. Connects housing justice to inequality, economic stability, and democratic politics. Relevant to understanding structural constraints on housing justice within contemporary capitalism. The inequality effects matter for distributive justice concerns. Shows how housing policy affects macroeconomic outcomes, not just housing markets. POSITION: Critical political economy; housing financialization as driver of inequality and instability.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Examines political consequences of housing financialization using German public opinion data. Finds housing financialization generates political backlash not just about rising rents but reflecting fundamental rejection of "financialized capitalism" treating housing as speculative asset. Germans conceptualize housing as social right and hold state responsible for under-provision. Citizens don't view housing in purely market terms; perceptions of fairness and justice shape attitudes about state's housing role. Housing's basic need status under attack affects political preferences. RELEVANCE: Provides empirical evidence for normative claims about housing commodification's wrongfulness. The fairness/justice framing confirms citizens recognize housing as special good. Shows how housing financialization affects political legitimacy and democratic politics. Relevant to debates about housing as market good vs. social right - public opinion aligns with right-to-housing advocates. Connects housing justice to political stability and citizen-state relations. Important evidence that housing ethics matters politically. POSITION: Empirical study supporting housing as social right; financialization rejection reflects justice concerns.},

  note = {CORE ARGUMENT: Reviews place attachment literature and implications for community participation and planning. Place attachment involves affective bonds between people and places developing through repeated interaction, meaning-making, and identity formation. Attachment motivates community participation, environmental stewardship, and resistance to unwanted change. Planning must understand how people's emotional connections to places affect participation patterns, conflict, and policy acceptance. Strong place attachment can lead to both pro-social collective action and defensive exclusion. RELEVANCE: Provides psychological foundation for occupancy rights and located life plans arguments. Shows empirically how place attachment develops over time through residence and community engagement, grounding temporal priority claims. Relevant to understanding why displacement is harmful beyond material losses - severs attachment bonds. Also relevant to NIMBY dynamics where attachment motivates exclusion. The ambivalent effects (pro-social vs. defensive) matter for normative assessment. Essential background for philosophical arguments about place-based claims.

Applies framework to homelessness and displacement as paradigm cases. Evaluates competing approaches to remedying structural injustice. RELEVANCE: Comprehensive overview of structural injustice framework applicable to housing. Shows how Young's concept has been developed and contested in philosophical literature. Useful for understanding alternatives to individual-responsibility models in housing justice. The homelessness application connects directly to housing justice domain. Helps situate Shelby, Young, and structural approaches within broader theoretical landscape. Essential for understanding what "structural" means in housing justice contexts.
