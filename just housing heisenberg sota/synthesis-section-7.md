## Section 7: Research Gaps and Future Directions

This review has surveyed diverse theoretical frameworks—distributive justice, temporal justice, occupancy rights, property theory, urban economics, and housing justice—addressing temporal claims to located goods. Despite rich interdisciplinary literature, significant gaps remain that future research must address to develop adequate normative frameworks for housing allocation, gentrification ethics, and spatial justice.

### Gap 1: Operationalizing Temporal Thresholds for Occupancy Rights

Occupancy theory establishes that temporal residence generates moral claims, but provides insufficient guidance on when and how these rights accrue. Stilz (2009, 2013, 2019) argues occupancy rights establish through "residence and participation in ongoing practices" but does not specify duration thresholds. Wells (2019) proposes minimum three years for lease-like rights, but is this sufficient for the deep place attachment occupancy theory emphasizes, or too long for mobile populations who may need protection sooner? No systematic account exists of how rights accumulate incrementally over time.

**Research needed**: Develop a graded account of occupancy rights accumulation specifying thresholds for different types of claims. Perhaps basic security rights (protection from arbitrary eviction) emerge quickly (months), residency rights (participation in local governance) at intermediate durations (1-2 years), and full anti-displacement rights (protection from gentrification-induced removal) after extended occupancy (3+ years). Integration with psychological research on place attachment formation could provide empirical grounding. Cross-cultural variation in mobility norms and housing tenure patterns should inform whether universal thresholds are appropriate or context-dependent criteria required. This operationalization is essential for translating philosophical theory into concrete policy guidance.

### Gap 2: Reconciling Incumbent Protection with Newcomer Access

The theoretical stalemate between incumbent protection and newcomer access represents the deepest unresolved tension. Occupancy rights theorists (Stilz, Moore, Krishnamurthy and Moore) emphasize claims of established residents based on temporal attachment and place-based life plans. Integration advocates (Anderson 2010) and cosmopolitans prioritize access to opportunity-rich locations and breaking down unjust segregation. Kogelmann (2025) demonstrates that autonomy arguments yield opposed conclusions, suggesting autonomy alone cannot adjudicate this conflict. No principled framework exists for determining when incumbent claims override access rights and vice versa.

**Research needed**: Develop priority rules specifying conditions under which incumbents' temporal claims take precedence versus when newcomers' access rights prevail. Apply Meyer and Waligore's (2022) supersession framework to identify what "changed circumstances" supersede versus preserve incumbent claims in housing contexts. Address whether there is normatively-significant asymmetry: do historically-displaced communities (those subjected to redlining, urban renewal) have stronger anti-gentrification claims than recent exclusionary suburbs? When does protecting established communities entrench unjust segregation requiring override? This requires integrating historical injustice theory, occupancy rights, and equal opportunity principles into unified framework addressing temporal priority systematically.

### Gap 3: Distributing Agglomeration Rents and Socially-Created Location Value

Urban economics establishes that city land values are largely socially created rather than individually produced. Albouy and Shin (2018) document over $2 trillion in concentrated urban land value. Moretti (2011) shows agglomeration creates 5x multiplier effects distributing productivity broadly through local economies. Combes and Gobillon (2015) confirm that density generates 2-5% productivity gains through sharing, matching, and learning mechanisms requiring social interaction and public infrastructure. Yet this socially-created value is captured by property owners through land appreciation rather than shared with workers who generate it or the public that invested in enabling infrastructure.

**Research needed**: Develop normative framework for distributing socially-created location value. Who deserves to capture agglomeration rents: current residents (rewarding priority), all residents (recognizing collective creation), national population (given public infrastructure investment and equal opportunity principles), or future generations (intergenerational trust)? How does temporal occupancy interact with value creation—do long-term residents have stronger claims than recent arrivals, or does value's social creation undermine occupancy-based appropriation? Consider mechanisms like land value taxation, community land trusts, and benefit-sharing arrangements. Connect to supersession debate: does past occupancy ground claims to future appreciation even when that appreciation results from socially-created agglomeration rather than individual effort?

### Gap 4: Temporal Justice and Path Dependency Obligations

Path dependency creates structural constraints without clear historical injustice, raising distinct normative questions. Baum-Snow (2007) shows that 1950s-70s highway routes reduced central city populations by 18% per ray, creating suburban development persisting today. Ganong and Shoag (2017) demonstrate that regulations enacted decades ago halted regional income convergence by preventing current low-income workers from accessing opportunity. Fischel's (2001) homevoter dynamics create self-reinforcing exclusion as homeowners protecting property values perpetuate restrictive zoning across generations.

**Research needed**: Develop framework for "structural historical obligations" distinct from direct wrongdoing-based rectification. When do inherited spatial configurations create duties even absent historical injustice claims? The current generation didn't enact exclusionary zoning or build Interstate highways, yet these decisions constrain their opportunities—does this generate obligations to reform inherited constraints? How does this relate to supersession: if past decisions weren't unjust initially but create cumulative disadvantage over time, when do obligations arise? Distinguish path dependency from historical injustice, specify when structural lock-in requires remedy, and address the intergenerational justice dimension of inheriting spatial constraints.

### Gap 5: Renters' Property Rights and Temporal Rights Accumulation

Property theory largely focuses on ownership while rental housing remains under-theorized despite renters constituting majorities in many urban areas. Honoré's (1961) bundle-of-rights shows property is disaggregatable, and Wells (2016, 2019) proposes lease-like rights for housing, but limited work develops how temporal occupancy might confer incremental property rights on renters beyond basic tenancy.

**Research needed**: Develop systematic account of how temporal rental occupancy creates accumulating property rights. Consider adverse possession as model—use over time can create ownership even absent formal title. Harding's (2019) Lockean spoilage proviso justification for squatting suggests productive use can trump formal title; does this logic extend to long-term renters? Specify which Honoré incidents (possession, use, management, income, security, residuary character) temporal renters might acquire: after 5 years' occupancy, do renters gain rights to manage property modifications, security against no-cause eviction, or even eventual ownership paths? Practical implications include tenant protections, rent control justification, right-to-purchase programs, and community land trusts. This normative theory should guide institutional design for rental housing justice.

### Gap 6: Scale and Subsidiarity in Housing Governance

Appropriate governmental level for housing decisions remains contested. Fischel (2001) shows local control produces exclusion via homevoter dynamics. Hsieh and Moretti (2019) demonstrate that local restrictions create 36% national GDP loss, suggesting externalities requiring higher-level intervention. Nine's (2025) foundational territories concept envisions overlapping, nested jurisdictions. Yet community self-determination and occupancy suggest local control legitimacy.

**Research needed**: Develop normative framework specifying which housing decisions belong at which governmental levels. Distinguish building standards (appropriately local?), inclusionary zoning requirements (regional?), fair housing enforcement (national?), and climate migration accommodation (international?). Consider overlapping jurisdictional authority (Nine's model) versus hierarchical override. Apply subsidiarity principles: presumption for local control unless clear externalities or rights violations require higher-level intervention, but what counts as sufficient externality? The 36% GDP loss from three cities' housing restrictions seems clearly sufficient, but where are thresholds? Use federalism empirics combined with normative political philosophy to develop principles balancing local self-determination against broader obligations.

### Gap 7: Supersession Criteria for Urban Neighborhood Change

Meyer and Waligore (2022) sophisticate supersession debate by distinguishing partial versus full supersession and dormant versus final supersession, but don't specify criteria for housing contexts. What counts as "morally relevant changed circumstances" when neighborhoods gentrify? Does gentrification partially supersede incumbent claims (weakening without eliminating them) or potentially fully (in extreme transformation)? Is supersession dormant (claims reassert if conditions change) or final?

**Research needed**: Apply Meyer and Waligore framework specifically to urban change, gentrification, and housing. Develop criteria distinguishing legitimate neighborhood evolution from wrongful displacement: population growth, economic development, infrastructure improvement, demographic shifts—which constitute superseding circumstances versus which create new injustices? Consider asymmetry: displacement from historically oppressed communities might resist supersession differently than displacement from exclusionary suburbs benefiting from past discrimination. Temporal dimensions: does supersession clock start immediately upon change or only after sufficient consolidation? Test criteria through case studies of specific gentrification instances to refine principles through reflective equilibrium between theory and intuitions.

### Gap 8: Integration of Philosophical and Empirical Urban Research

Limited dialogue exists between philosophy and urban economics/geography despite obvious synergies. Philosophers often lack empirical grounding regarding magnitudes, mechanisms, and causal relationships. Economists rarely engage normative questions about fairness, desert, and just distribution. Notable exceptions like Hsieh and Moretti (2019) provide empirical foundations that could inform normative debates, but such integration remains rare.

**Research needed**: Foster collaborations between philosophers and urban economists/geographers. Empirically test normative intuitions: do temporal thresholds for occupancy rights track psychological place attachment patterns? Do communities' expressed preferences about displacement reflect the values occupancy theory attributes to place-based life plans? Philosophical analysis of economic findings: how should agglomeration rents be distributed? Is spatial misallocation unjust beyond inefficiency? What fairness principles should govern who captures land value appreciation? Housing provides paradigmatic case for empirically-informed normative theory—location value is quantifiable, displacement is measurable, temporal attachment can be studied. Exploit this potential for integrated research bridging normative political philosophy and empirical urban studies.

### Gap 9: Displacement Measurement and Normative Significance

Empirical displacement evidence is contested. Ellen and O'Regan (2011) and Dragan et al. (2020) find limited displacement with environmental improvements for stayers. Critical scholars (Lees et al. 2008, Slater 2006) argue displacement is real but methodologically difficult to measure, and that research focusing on benefits marginalizes displacement harms. Normative questions remain unresolved: if original residents benefit from gentrification on average, does this make it just? Or do non-displacement harms, distributional asymmetries within staying populations, and rights violations against displaced minorities create injustice regardless of aggregate welfare gains?

**Research needed**: Clarify relationship between empirical displacement findings and normative assessment. Specify what empirical evidence would and would not settle normative questions. If residents rarely move but experience phenomenological displacement (Lopez-Cantero 2025), is this sufficient harm? If aggregate neighborhood quality improves but benefits are unequally distributed (affluent newcomers capture most gains), does this constitute injustice? Develop metrics for gentrification benefit/burden distribution beyond simple displacement rates: who gains how much, who loses what, how are non-material losses (community dissolution, democratic damage) weighted against material improvements? Address methodological challenges in displacement measurement to improve empirical foundation for normative theorizing.

### Gap 10: Climate Migration and Housing Justice Integration

Climate change creates urgent new dimensions for temporal housing claims. Stilz (2024) applies occupancy theory to climate displacement, arguing territorial justice requires prioritizing in situ adaptation enabling people to remain. Ganong and Shoag (2017) show housing costs already prevent mobility to opportunity. Climate refugees will need housing in productive, safe cities where current residents resist demographic change and housing costs exclude low-income migrants.

**Research needed**: Integrate climate justice with housing justice literature systematically. Apply temporal justice frameworks (supersession, occupancy, property) to climate displacement: do climate refugees' urgent needs supersede incumbent residents' occupancy claims? Or do both have legitimate competing claims requiring accommodation? How do future climate impacts affect present housing allocation—should cities expected to become climate refuges face special obligations to expand housing capacity now? Intergenerational dimension: current generation's housing exclusion prevents future generation's climate adaptation. Consider mechanism design: how can housing policy accommodate climate migration while respecting place-based claims? What obligations do productive coastal cities have to climate-displaced populations? This integration is urgently needed as climate migration accelerates.

### Synthesis and Priorities

These ten gaps represent substantial opportunities for advancing both theoretical understanding and practical housing policy. They cluster around four priority themes. First, **operationalizing temporal dimensions** (Gaps 1, 5): translating philosophical concepts of occupancy and rights accumulation into concrete thresholds and institutional designs that can guide policy. Second, **reconciling competing temporal claims** (Gaps 2, 7): developing priority rules for when incumbent attachment overrides access rights versus when equal opportunity or integration imperatives prevail. Third, **empirically-informed normative theory** (Gaps 3, 8, 9): integrating urban economics and geography with philosophical analysis to develop theories responsive to actual magnitudes, mechanisms, and empirical realities. Fourth, **climate integration** (Gap 10): addressing how climate displacement transforms housing justice debates with added urgency.

Addressing these gaps requires genuinely interdisciplinary collaboration. Philosophers must engage empirical urban research to ground normative theorizing in economic and social realities. Economists and geographers must take normative questions seriously rather than assuming efficiency or preference-satisfaction resolve distributive conflicts. Policy researchers and urban planners need philosophical frameworks for thinking through temporal tradeoffs and competing claims beyond political feasibility. Climate scientists and migration scholars should inform housing justice debates about future pressures and constraints.

The stakes are substantial. Housing policy affects not just current distribution but intergenerational opportunity, regional economic development, climate adaptation capacity, and the fundamental question of who can live where. Temporal claims to located goods—incumbents versus newcomers, past versus present versus future, historical injustice versus changed circumstances—structure these debates at every level. Developing adequate normative frameworks for adjudicating these temporal tensions is among the most important tasks for political philosophy, with direct implications for millions facing housing precarity, displacement, or exclusion from opportunity-rich locations. The theoretical resources reviewed here provide foundations, but substantial work remains to build on these foundations toward integrated, empirically-grounded, practically-relevant theories of temporal justice for housing in a non-fungible, path-dependent, rapidly changing spatial economy.
