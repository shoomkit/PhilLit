# Section 3: Labor Market Determinants - Wages, Dualization, and the Public Sector

If housing burden distribution reflects both housing supply constraints and household incomes, then wage dynamics should substantially explain burden variation. Three hypotheses address income-side determinants: Hypothesis 3 (public sector wage repression affects housing burden), Hypothesis 4 (80%+ of burden change explained by wage income changes), and Hypothesis 5 (housing burden determined by dualized housing and labor markets). The evidence reveals complex patterns: wage stagnation post-2000 coincides with burden increases, but public sector wages kept pace on average; dualization theory provides comprehensive framework but lacks direct German quantification of housing impacts; and housing policy's limited effectiveness suggests structural labor market factors dominate.

## Wage Stagnation and Decline (2000-2015)

German wage dynamics from 2000-2015 created conditions conducive to rising housing burdens. The International Monetary Fund (2015) documents that the Hartz IV labor market reform reduced real wages by approximately 4%, with decline strongest at the 25th and 50th percentiles of the wage distribution. This reform coincided with a prolonged period of negative average wage growth. Dustmann et al. (2014) show that after 1999, wage gains no longer kept pace with productivity: total labor compensation fell from 61% of GDP in 2001 to 55% in 2007, representing a substantial shift in income distribution away from wages. In late 1990s, labor unions explicitly declared willingness to accept real wage stagnation in exchange for job creation.

International comparison highlights Germany's exceptional wage restraint. Bosch (2017) calculates that Germany achieved a 2% reduction in unit labor costs between 2000 and 2007, while all other OECD countries averaged a 22% increase—a 24-percentage-point divergence. This wage moderation was not uniform across sectors: unit labor costs grew much faster in manufacturing and financial sectors and much slower in construction, public sector, and low-end services. Hassel (2014) characterizes the wage restraint in low-end services as "exceptional in western Europe," arguing that liberalization led Germany to increasingly resemble a liberal market economy in service sectors where weak workers' wages depend on price mechanisms.

Collective bargaining decline contributed to wage dispersion. Addison et al. (2014) document that sectoral collective bargaining coverage decreased by 14 percentage points in western Germany and 18 percentage points in eastern Germany between 1996 and 2009. By 2009, only 56% of employees in western Germany and 38% in eastern Germany worked in establishments covered by sectoral collective agreements. Entering a collective agreement increases average wages by 3-3.5%, while abandoning one decreases wages by 3-4%, creating significant distributional effects. Biewen and Seckler (2018) decompose rising wage inequality, showing that de-unionization accounts for a substantial portion of increased wage dispersion. This distributional pattern—declining wages concentrated at lower percentiles—directly maps onto housing burden patterns where bottom quintiles face rapidly rising burdens.

Dustmann et al. (2022) establish the crucial connection: the income share devoted to housing rose disproportionately for the bottom income quintile while falling for the top quintile. This suggests that wage stagnation 2000-2015, particularly for lower-wage workers, contributed materially to housing burden increases. However, no study directly quantifies what proportion of burden variation wage changes explain. Hypothesis 4's proposition that "80%+ of burden change is explained by wage income changes" receives indirect support through temporal coincidence—wage declines 2000-2015 coincide with burden increases—but lacks explicit decomposition. The literature documents both wage stagnation and burden increases but stops short of variance decomposition that would attribute causal proportions.

## Public Sector Wages: Mixed Evidence

Hypothesis 3 proposed that public sector wage repression contributes to housing burden. Evidence does not support systematic public sector wage repression in aggregate. Deutsche Bundesbank (2024) reports that from 2009 to 2018, collective earnings in the public sector rose by approximately 24% in nominal terms, compared to 25% for the economy as a whole—essentially identical growth rates. The public sector experienced particularly high wage increases in 2022 (federal and local government) and 2023 (states), outstripping even the metal industry. Real wage losses from the inflation period 2021-2023 have now been largely recouped, with wages rising sharply and continuing strong growth in 2024.

However, institutional structure creates heterogeneity within the public sector. Schmidt and Müller (2024) identify a dual employment system: civil servants (Beamte) without collective bargaining or strike rights versus public sector employees with strong union bargaining power. Civil servants' pay is determined by government without negotiation, creating rigid compensation structures (Keller and Kirsch 2020). The IFO Institute (2020) argues that rigid pay scales make the public sector not attractive enough for recruiting skilled workers, predicting a need for approximately 1 million public sector employees by 2030 amid competition with private companies. This suggests structural pay constraints for specific public sector groups, even if aggregate public sector wages kept pace.

The contrast with private sector developments is instructive. Schmidt and Müller (2024) document that Germany's wage negotiation system has been losing importance for years in the private sector, while showing no signs of erosion in collective bargaining in the public sector. Eichhorst and Marx (2015) characterize labor market duality as partially attributed to reforms promoting non-standard employment and expanding low pay in the private sector, with dualization supporting disinflation by creating low-wage sectors and fostering intra-firm competition as a disciplinary device encouraging wage moderation. Approximately 3.6 million employees work in Germany's public sector, with more than 2.5 million covered by TVöD (Tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen Dienst), maintaining relatively strong bargaining structures compared to private sector erosion (Boeckler 2024).

**Assessment of H3**: The hypothesis receives limited support. Public sector wages kept pace with overall economy growth 2009-2018, and recent years show public sector wage gains outstripping private sector in some cases. There is no evidence of systematic wage repression for public sector workers that would disproportionately affect their housing burdens. However, civil servants face distinct institutional constraints through rigid government-determined pay without negotiation rights. The critical gap is that no study directly compares housing burdens of public versus private sector workers at similar income levels, controlling for relevant factors. The available evidence suggests that if public sector workers face elevated housing burdens, it is not primarily through wage repression but through factors common to all workers at their income levels.

## Dualization Theory: Linking Labor and Housing Markets

Hypothesis 5 proposes that housing burden is determined by dualized housing and labor markets, drawing on political economy literature identifying insider-outsider divides in continental European welfare states. This theoretical framework provides the most comprehensive account of structural factors affecting burden distribution, though empirical quantification for Germany remains incomplete.

The dualization framework's foundations are established by Palier and Thelen (2010), who demonstrate that French and German political economies have been significantly reconfigured over the past two decades, with dualism now "explicitly underwritten by state policy." They trace how the OECD's 1990s job strategy was implemented not for all workers but for secondary labor markets, while job protection increased for shrinking core sectors, producing institutionalized but distinctly less egalitarian models. Dualization begins in industrial relations, moves into labor market dynamics, and finds institutional expression in welfare state reforms.

Emmenegger et al. (2012) provide the comprehensive theoretical synthesis in *The Age of Dualization*, showing that poverty, inequality, and social exclusion have structural roots in seemingly permanent trends toward dualization since the 1970s. They define dualization as a political process characterized by differential treatment of insiders and outsiders, taking forms of newly created institutional dualisms or deepening existing ones. Comparative analysis reveals that Nordic countries witness lower insider-outsider divides, whereas continental, liberal, and southern welfare states show divides as core characteristics of political economy. Continental and southern European regimes perpetuate and reinforce insider-outsider divides across three dimensions: industrial relations (covered vs. uncovered by collective bargaining), labor market policy (employment protection for permanent vs. temporary workers), and welfare state access (contribution-based vs. residual entitlements).

Several mechanisms operate dualization. Schwander (2019) focuses on increasing disparities between securely employed market insiders and expanding proportions of market outsiders with precarious employment. Rueda (2005) demonstrates that insider-outsider politics structures political conflict, with social democratic parties facing trade-offs between core insider constituencies and broader working classes including outsiders. Emmenegger (2009) shows that strong unions and left governments protect insiders while being less responsive to outsiders. Davidsson and Emmenegger (2013) argue that unions often prioritize organizational survival over broad membership interests, contributing to dualization persistence. Biegert (2019) provides comparative evidence that institutions protecting labor market insiders—employment protection, unionization, unemployment benefits—are frequently associated with greater inequality between disadvantaged groups and insider peers. Continental Europe shows strongest insider-outsider divides regarding labor market inequalities, welfare inequalities, and political integration. Welfare regimes reinforce labor market dualism through taxes and transfers: net wage gaps lie 5-8 percentage points above gross wage gaps in continental Europe.

Marx (2012) identifies institutional complementarities across industrial relations, labor market, and welfare state, showing how changes in one domain reinforce dualization in others. Häusermann and Schwander (2012) demonstrate that continental European countries, including Germany, exhibit the strongest forms of employment-based dualization, with insider protection combined with outsider flexibility characterizing Germany's specific trajectory.

The crucial connection to housing comes through Lennartz and Helbrecht (2020), who explicitly link insider-outsider divides in employment to housing outcomes. They demonstrate that similar trends appear in housing markets across advanced economies as in labor markets, with employment precarity (outsider status) affecting housing tenure choice and housing cost burden. Outsiders face higher rent burdens, reduced access to homeownership, and greater displacement risk. This creates systematic connection between labor market position and housing outcomes.

Supporting this connection, multiple housing factors interact with dualization. Brezina and Saischek (2011) document social housing proportion falling dramatically: from 2.6 million units (2002) to 1.4 million (2014), an annual loss exceeding 41,000 units due to expiring price controls. Subsidy periods reduced from up to 50 years historically to 10-15 years recently. Elimination of tax benefits for non-profit corporations in 1988 propelled this decline. Large-scale privatization to institutional investors transformed rental markets. Holm et al. (2021) show Berlin's social housing declined from 360,000 units (1990) to approximately 100,000 (2020). Habitat for Humanity (2021) reports overall German social housing fell from 4 million (1980s) to roughly 1 million today.

Rent control shows limited effectiveness. Kholodilin, Mense, and Michelsen (2016) evaluate the 2015 Mietpreisbremse (rent brake) using difference-in-differences, finding it reduced offered rents in Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich by up to 5% initially, but this effect vanished approximately one year after implementation, illustrating significant implementation deficit. Thomschke (2019) confirms effects lagging behind expectations and vanishing over time. Baye and Dinger (2024) argue that rent control promotes gentrification and amplifies supply shortage by causing negative effects on yields for regulated rental objects while raising yields for exempted objects, shifting rental housing supply away from regulated segments.

Housing benefits provide limited reach. Jagemann (2022) documents that the Housing Benefit Plus Act (January 2023) doubled housing benefits from €190 to €370 per month on average and doubled recipients, but the program reaches only 550,000-1,100,000 households—a fraction of those experiencing burden.

**Assessment of H5**: Dualization theory receives strong theoretical support as framework for understanding housing burden. The literature establishes: (1) comprehensive dualization framework showing state-supported insider-outsider divides in Germany (Palier & Thelen, Emmenegger et al.); (2) explicit conceptual link between labor market status and housing outcomes (Lennartz & Helbrecht); (3) institutional complementarities across industrial relations, labor markets, welfare state, and housing policy (Marx). However, a critical empirical gap persists: no German study directly tests whether labor market insider/outsider status predicts housing burden levels after controlling for income. The framework is conceptually compelling and supported by indirect evidence—Dewilde showing market renters' deteriorating position, Dustmann showing bottom quintile burden rising, wage stagnation literature showing outsiders face wage penalties—but lacks quantified decomposition showing how much of housing burden variation labor market status explains independently of income level.

## Housing Policy Effectiveness: Structural Factors Dominant

The limited effectiveness of housing-side policy interventions provides indirect support for Hypotheses 4 and 5 by suggesting that structural labor market factors dominate burden determination. If rent control, social housing, and housing benefits all show modest effects, then income-side factors (wages, dualization) likely matter more.

The evidence pattern is consistent: rent control reduces rents by 5% initially but effects vanish within a year (Kholodilin et al. 2016; Thomschke 2019); social housing declined from 4 million to 1 million units (Habitat 2021; Brezina & Saischek 2011); housing benefits reach only 550,000-1,100,000 households despite being doubled (Jagemann 2022). Even Berlin's dramatic 2020 rent freeze, subsequently ruled unconstitutional, produced only temporary effects. These limited outcomes suggest that addressing housing burden may require labor market interventions—wage policies, reducing dualization, strengthening collective bargaining—rather than relying solely on housing-side policies.

## Summary: Labor Market Primacy Plausible but Unquantified

Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coincides temporally with housing burden increases, creating strong circumstantial case for causal connection (H4 plausible but not directly quantified). Public sector wages kept pace with overall economy on average, though civil servants face rigid determination (H3 not supported in aggregate). Dualization theory provides comprehensive framework linking labor market insider-outsider status to housing outcomes through institutional complementarities (H5 strong theoretical framework but empirical gap on direct quantification). Housing policy's limited effectiveness suggests structural labor market factors may be more determinative than housing supply interventions.

Two critical gaps emerge: First, no decomposition study quantifies what proportion of housing burden variation wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition changes explain—the "80%+ wage explanation" in H4 lacks empirical test. Second, no study directly tests whether labor market status (insider/outsider) predicts housing burden after controlling for income level—H5's mechanism lacks German quantification. The next section synthesizes these findings and identifies specific research priorities.
