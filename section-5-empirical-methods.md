# Section 5: Empirical Methods for Conceptual Work

The preceding sections reveal a persistent tension: philosophical sophistication about autonomy concepts paired with limited empirical grounding versus robust empirical evidence about workplace autonomy with limited conceptual depth. Bridging this divide requires methodological frameworks that can integrate empirical investigation with conceptual work. This section examines three methodological approaches: experimental philosophy for testing concepts empirically, grounded theory for developing concepts from qualitative data, and conceptual engineering for normatively improving concepts. Together, these approaches suggest pathways for empirically-informed conceptual revision.

## Experimental Philosophy: Testing Concepts Empirically

Experimental philosophy (x-phi) emerged in the early 2000s as a movement using empirical methods—surveys, experiments, behavioral studies—to test philosophical claims about concepts and intuitions. Knobe and Nichols' (2008) foundational volume *Experimental Philosophy* established the field's core methodology: systematically investigating whether philosophical theories accurately capture how people actually think about philosophical concepts.

Knobe's (2003) discovery of the "Knobe effect" exemplifies x-phi methodology. He presented participants with vignettes where a chairman knowingly but unintentionally brings about side effects—environmental harm in one version, environmental benefit in another. Despite identical epistemic structure, participants judged the harm intentional but the benefit unintentional. This demonstrates that moral judgments influence folk concepts of intentional action, contrary to philosophical theories treating intentionality as purely epistemic.

For autonomy research, x-phi offers methods for testing whether philosophical autonomy theories capture folk understanding. Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich's (2001) pioneering study found that epistemic intuitions varied by ethnicity and socioeconomic status, challenging claims that philosophical intuitions are universal. If autonomy intuitions similarly vary, this has implications for which autonomy concepts are adequate.

The Alfano et al. (2024) Stanford Encyclopedia entry on experimental moral philosophy surveys x-phi findings on moral responsibility, free will, and intentional action—all concepts closely related to autonomy. Nahmias et al.'s (2005, 2006) studies of free will intuitions found that most participants judge agents in deterministic scenarios can have free will and moral responsibility, contradicting philosophical incompatibilism. However, when determinism is described to suggest "bypassing" (mental states causally irrelevant), incompatibilist judgments emerge.

X-phi's value for autonomy research includes: (1) systematic empirical investigation of folk concepts rather than armchair theorizing, (2) discovery of factors (moral judgments, framing, cultural background) affecting intuitions, (3) methods for testing whether philosophical theories align with actual concept usage, and (4) evidence about concept variability across populations.

However, x-phi faces limitations. Cappelen (2012) in *Philosophy Without Intuitions* argues that philosophers don't actually rely much on intuitions despite methodological pronouncements. Strevens (2019) defends armchair methods using cognitive science, arguing that edge cases can generate genuine knowledge. Nado (2014) reviews evidence that philosophers themselves show biases and framing effects, complicating expertise defenses.

For workplace autonomy specifically, x-phi could test whether workers' autonomy concepts align with philosophical theories. Do workers judge autonomy violated by algorithmic opacity? Does information asymmetry affect autonomy attributions? How do workers trade off different autonomy dimensions? Yet relatively little x-phi work addresses workplace concepts directly—an important gap.

## Grounded Theory: Developing Concepts from Qualitative Data

Where x-phi tests existing concepts, grounded theory (GT) develops new concepts systematically from qualitative data. Glaser and Strauss' (1967) *The Discovery of Grounded Theory* revolutionized qualitative methodology by proposing rigorous procedures for theory generation: constant comparative analysis, theoretical sampling, coding, memo-writing, and pursuing analysis until theoretical saturation.

Classic GT emphasizes letting patterns emerge from data rather than imposing pre-existing frameworks. Glaser's (1978) *Theoretical Sensitivity* focuses on conceptualization rather than mere description—the goal is generating concepts and theories, not just documenting what people say. This makes GT particularly valuable for philosophical concept development from empirical materials.

However, GT evolved in multiple directions. Charmaz's (2006, 2014) constructivist GT challenges Glaser's objectivism, arguing that theories are constructed not discovered. Researchers co-construct data and theory with participants. Charmaz emphasizes reflexivity, researcher positionality, and acknowledgment that all theories reflect particular standpoints. The 2014 second edition updates methodology while maintaining constructivist commitments.

Mills, Bonner, and Francis (2006) trace constructivist GT's philosophical foundations, clarifying ontological and epistemological differences from classic GT. Constructivist GT is more compatible with normative philosophical work than objectivist versions because it acknowledges values and purposes shape concept construction. For ameliorative conceptual projects (discussed below), constructivist GT provides methodology acknowledging that concepts can be built to serve normative purposes while remaining grounded in empirical realities.

Clarke's (2005) *Situational Analysis* extends GT for postmodern contexts, adding mapping techniques (situational maps, social worlds/arenas maps, positional maps) for analyzing complex situations with multiple perspectives and power relations. This sophistication suits workplace contexts where multiple stakeholders (workers, managers, platforms, regulators) have different interests and perspectives.

For autonomy research, GT offers methods for developing autonomy concepts from worker experiences rather than importing philosophical theories wholesale. What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant features of algorithmic management? How do they make sense of control, agency, and freedom in platform contexts? What categories emerge from their accounts? GT provides systematic methods for answering these questions while developing conceptual frameworks grounded in actual experiences.

Limitations include: (1) GT was developed primarily for sociology, not philosophy—how to maintain normative philosophical goals while following GT procedures requires methodological adaptation. (2) GT's inductive orientation can make it difficult to engage critically with existing theories while remaining open to emergent concepts. (3) GT requires substantial qualitative data and analytical time, making it resource-intensive compared to conceptual analysis alone.

## Conceptual Engineering and Ameliorative Analysis

While x-phi tests existing concepts and GT develops concepts from data, conceptual engineering asks how concepts can be improved to better serve our purposes. Haslanger's (2012) *Resisting Reality* develops ameliorative analysis as revolutionary methodological intervention. Rather than analyzing what concepts like "woman" or "knowledge" currently mean, ameliorative analysis asks what they *should* mean given our normative goals.

For gender, Haslanger proposes ameliorated concepts serving emancipatory aims rather than merely describing existing usage. This licensing of normative concept revision based on practical purposes transforms conceptual methodology from purely descriptive to explicitly normative project.

Applied to workplace autonomy: instead of just analyzing what "autonomy" means philosophically or how workers currently understand it, ameliorative analysis asks what autonomy concept would best serve our practical and ethical purposes in AI-mediated work contexts. This could justify revising autonomy concepts based on empirical findings about what actually matters for human flourishing, dignity, and agency in algorithmic management contexts.

Burgess, Cappelen, and Plunkett's (2020) edited volume *Conceptual Engineering and Conceptual Ethics* establishes conceptual engineering as distinct field. Twenty chapters explore how to assess and ameliorate representational devices (concepts, words). The introduction provides a "guided tour" mapping diverse approaches from Haslanger-style amelioration to Carnapian explication.

Plunkett and Sundell's (2013) work on metalinguistic disagreement reveals that many apparent philosophical disagreements are actually about concepts themselves—negotiating what terms should mean rather than substantive facts. This suggests autonomy debates may involve metalinguistic negotiation: not just whether AI systems threaten autonomy but what "autonomy" should mean in algorithmic contexts.

Conceptual engineering's value for autonomy research includes: (1) explicit permission for normative concept revision rather than merely descriptive analysis, (2) frameworks for evaluating concepts based on how well they serve our purposes, (3) methods for improving concepts to address new phenomena (like algorithmic management) not anticipated when concepts were originally developed, and (4) integration of normative goals with conceptual precision.

Limitations include: (1) Risk of revisionary concepts becoming disconnected from existing usage and debates. (2) Disagreement about goals can make ameliorative projects controversial—whose purposes should concepts serve? (3) Balance between conceptual innovation and preserving continuity with existing frameworks is difficult to maintain. (4) Empirical investigation is needed to know what concept would actually serve purposes, but conceptual engineering literature has limited engagement with empirical methods.

## Integrating Empirical and Normative Methods

The three methodological approaches—x-phi, GT, conceptual engineering—offer complementary resources for empirically-informed conceptual work:

**X-phi** can test whether existing autonomy concepts capture folk understanding and identify factors affecting autonomy judgments. For workplace autonomy, this could reveal how opacity, information asymmetry, and algorithmic control affect autonomy attributions.

**Grounded theory** can develop new conceptual frameworks from systematic analysis of worker experiences with algorithmic management. Rather than assuming existing theories adequately capture the phenomenon, GT allows emergent categories grounded in data.

**Conceptual engineering** provides normative framework for evaluating and improving concepts. Once we know (from x-phi or GT) how autonomy is understood and (from empirical workplace research) what conditions affect flourishing, ameliorative analysis can propose revised concepts serving our purposes.

Integration could proceed as follows:

1. **Empirical investigation**: Use qualitative methods (interviews, ethnography) informed by GT to investigate worker experiences with algorithmic management. What do workers identify as autonomy-relevant? What conceptual categories emerge from their accounts?

2. **Concept testing**: Use x-phi methods to test whether philosophical autonomy theories align with folk understanding. How do workers judge autonomy under different algorithmic management conditions?

3. **Normative evaluation**: Drawing on philosophical frameworks and empirical evidence about what predicts flourishing/well-being, identify what autonomy concept would best serve our normative purposes.

4. **Conceptual revision**: Develop ameliorated autonomy concept informed by empirical findings, tested against folk understanding, and designed to serve normative purposes.

5. **Validation**: Test whether revised concept better captures what matters empirically and serves purposes better than existing alternatives.

This integrated approach combines philosophical sophistication with empirical grounding. It acknowledges that concepts must be both descriptively adequate (capturing relevant phenomena) and normatively appropriate (serving our purposes). Neither purely armchair philosophy nor theory-free empiricism suffices—integration is required.

## Methodological Challenges

Several challenges face empirically-informed conceptual work:

**Expertise and training**: Integration requires both philosophical training (in conceptual analysis, normative theory) and empirical skills (qualitative methods, experimental design). Few researchers have deep training in both.

**Institutional barriers**: Academic philosophy largely rewards armchair conceptual work, while empirical research is seen as "not really philosophy." Conversely, empirical social sciences may view philosophical conceptual work as unscientific speculation. Integrative work risks falling between disciplinary stools.

**Time and resources**: Empirical research requires time for data collection and analysis that pure conceptual work doesn't. Funding structures may not support philosophical research with empirical components.

**Evaluation criteria**: How to evaluate success in empirically-informed conceptual work? Philosophical rigor? Empirical adequacy? Practical usefulness? Clarity about success criteria is needed.

Despite challenges, methodological frameworks exist for combining empirical investigation with conceptual sophistication. The question is not whether such integration is possible but whether researchers will undertake it. For workplace autonomy and AI, the integration seems not just possible but necessary—existing purely philosophical or purely empirical approaches both face systematic limitations that integration could address.
