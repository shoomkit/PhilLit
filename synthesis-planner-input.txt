SYNTHESIS PLANNING REQUEST

Research Question: What explains what proportion of income people spend on housing?
Geographic Focus: Germany (primary), Europe (secondary)

Research Hypotheses to Investigate:
1. Even in cities with quickly rising housing costs, housing cost burdens are flat for median incomes
2. High housing burdens are an issue for city dwellers with low incomes
3. High housing burdens are an issue for public servants / wage repression in public sector
4. More than 80% of housing-burden change is explicable by changes in wage income
5. Housing burden is determined by dualized housing and labor markets
6. The answer depends on how labor income and housing costs are operationalized (normatively charged)

Literature Base:
- Domain 1 (Housing Affordability Economics): 15 papers
- Domain 2 (Labor Market & Wage Dynamics): 12 papers
- Domain 3 (Dualization Theory): 10 papers
- Domain 4 (Urban Housing Markets): 12 papers
- Domain 5 (Measurement & Operationalization): 8 papers
- Domain 6 (Housing Policy): 11 papers
- TOTAL: 68 validated papers

All papers are in BibTeX files: literature-domain-1.bib through literature-domain-6.bib

Target Output:
- 3000-4000 word literature review
- NO STRICT LIMIT on number of citations (use as many of the 68 papers as are relevant)
- 3-4 sections with specific word allocations
- Emphasize empirical evidence and quantitative findings (geography, time period, control variables, main quantified findings)
- Organize around the 6 hypotheses
- Identify key debates and specific research gaps

Task: Create synthesis-outline.md with tight structure emphasizing analytical depth and key debates
