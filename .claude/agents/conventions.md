# Shared Conventions for Literature Review Agents

This file contains specifications shared across multiple agents. Reference this file rather than duplicating content.

---

## File Encoding: UTF-8

**All output files MUST use UTF-8 encoding.**

Requirements:
- Preserve diacritics in author names exactly (e.g., Kästner, Müller, García)
- Use proper special characters: ä ö ü é è ñ ç etc.
- Use typographic characters: em-dash (—), en-dash (–), curly quotes (" " ' ')
- Never convert special characters to ASCII approximations

**Verification**: Run `file [filename]` — should show "UTF-8 Unicode text"

## Quality Standards

### Citation Integrity

**Absolute Rules**:
- ❌ Never fabricate papers, authors, or publications
- ❌ Never create synthetic DOIs
- ❌ Never cite papers not verified through search
- ✅ Only cite papers found via skill scripts (s2_search, search_openalex, etc.)
- ✅ Papers from structured APIs are verified at search time
- ✅ Use `verify_paper.py` for DOI verification when needed
- ✅ If DOI unavailable, omit the field

### Citation Integration in Prose

**Good** (analytical):
> Fischer and Ravizza (1998) argue that guidance control—the ability to regulate behavior through reasons-responsive mechanisms—grounds moral responsibility. This differs crucially from libertarian views...

**Poor** (list-like):
> Many philosophers have written about this (Frankfurt 1971; Dennett 1984; Fischer and Ravizza 1998).

### Gap Specificity

**Good** (specific, evidence-based):
> While compatibilist frameworks are philosophically sophisticated, Vargas (2013) notes they "lack empirical operationalization" (p. 203). No study has measured neural mechanisms of reasons-responsiveness.

**Poor** (vague):
> More research is needed on free will and neuroscience.

## Annotation Quality

**Annotations are the core intellectual contribution of literature research.** This section defines quality standards for domain overviews and individual entry annotations.

### Writing Style

- **Concise and direct.** Short, clear sentences.
- **No academic jargon.** Write for clarity, not to impress.
- **No redundant phrases.** Cut "it is important to note that" and similar hedging.
- **Active voice.** "Craver argues X" not "It is argued by Craver that X"
- **Substantive claims.** State what the paper *actually argues*, not that it "addresses" or "explores" a topic.

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Never write:
- "Important contribution to the field"
- "Raises important questions"
- "Significant implications for"
- "This paper explores/examines/investigates"
- "Relevant to our project" (without saying *how*)
- Generic phrases that could apply to any paper

### Domain Overview Quality

The `@comment` section establishes context for synthesis agents. Each component:

**DOMAIN_OVERVIEW** (2-3 paragraphs):
- Name key authors and works that anchor the field
- Identify distinct positions or schools of thought
- Note recent developments or shifts in the debate
- Be specific: cite paper names, concepts, years

**RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT** (2-3 sentences):
- State the *specific* connection to the research question
- Explain what this domain contributes that others don't

**NOTABLE_GAPS** (1-2 sentences):
- Identify concrete under-explored areas
- Be specific enough that a researcher could act on it

**SYNTHESIS_GUIDANCE** (1-2 sentences):
- Suggest how to use this domain in the review
- Note tensions or connections with other domains

### Individual Entry Annotations

The `note` field serves synthesis agents. Structure as CORE ARGUMENT, RELEVANCE, POSITION—but prioritize quality over rigid format. If a paper resists this structure, adapt.

**CORE ARGUMENT** (2-4 sentences):
- State the paper's central thesis
- Include key concepts, frameworks, or findings introduced
- Capture the argumentative structure, not just topic

**RELEVANCE** (2-3 sentences):
- Connect *specifically* to the research project
- Note what gap this fills or leaves open
- Identify tensions or complementarities with other papers

**POSITION** (1 sentence):
- Place in intellectual landscape
- Identify school, tradition, or debate position

### Exemplar: High-Quality Entry

```bibtex
@book{craver2007explaining,
  author = {Craver, Carl F.},
  title = {Explaining the Brain: Mechanisms and the Mosaic Unity of Neuroscience},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  year = {2007},
  doi = {10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199299317.001.0001},
  note = {
  CORE ARGUMENT: Develops comprehensive mechanistic account of explanation in neuroscience, introducing "levels of mechanisms" defined by constitutive part-whole relationships rather than size or disciplinary boundaries. Argues neuroscience achieves unity through interlevel integration via mechanisms, not reduction to physics. Provides mutual manipulability (MM) criterion for constitutive relevance: X's φ-ing is constitutively relevant to S's ψ-ing when interventions on X change ψ-ing and vice versa.

  RELEVANCE: Central work for understanding levels of organization and mechanistic explanation criteria directly applicable to neural network interpretability. The MM criterion provides testable conditions for claims about component relevance in artificial neural networks. However, challenges arise when trying to identify genuine constitutive relationships versus mere correlations in learned representations.

  POSITION: New mechanist framework - develops levels of mechanisms and constitutive relevance criteria.
  },
  keywords = {mechanisms, levels-of-mechanisms, neuroscience, High}
}
```

**Why this works:**
- States specific thesis (levels defined by part-whole relations, not size)
- Names the key concept introduced (mutual manipulability criterion)
- Connects to research project with concrete application (testable conditions for component relevance)
- Notes a limitation (constitutive vs correlational challenge)
- Places in intellectual landscape (new mechanist framework)

### Exemplar: Domain Overview

```
DOMAIN_OVERVIEW:
The "new mechanistic" philosophy emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s,
spearheaded by Machamer, Darden, and Craver (2000), Glennan (1996, 2017), and
Bechtel and Richardson (1993/2010). This framework shifted philosophical focus
from laws and covering-law explanation to mechanisms as the basic units of
scientific explanation across the life sciences. A mechanism is characterized as
entities and activities organized to produce regular changes from start to finish
conditions.

Central to mechanistic explanation is the concept of "levels of mechanisms"
(Craver 2007), which differ from traditional size-based or disciplinary levels.
Mechanistic levels are defined by constitutive part-whole relationships: lower-level
components constitute higher-level capacities when properly organized.

RELEVANCE_TO_PROJECT:
This domain provides theoretical grounding for what counts as "mechanistic" in
mechanistic interpretability of AI systems. The philosophical framework helps clarify
when interpretability efforts genuinely provide mechanistic understanding versus
superficial description.

NOTABLE_GAPS:
Systematic philosophical analysis of AI/ML systems through the mechanistic lens
remains sparse. Whether artificial neural networks satisfy the organization and
constitutive criteria for mechanisms is underexplored.
```

**Why this works:**
- Names specific authors and years
- Defines key terms concretely
- States relevance to project directly
- Identifies actionable gap

## File Assembly

### Combining Section Files

Use proper spacing for markdown parsing:

```bash
for f in synthesis-section-*.md; do cat "$f"; echo; echo; done > literature-review-final.md
```

Two blank lines between sections ensures pandoc parses headings correctly.
