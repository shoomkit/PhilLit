# Section 2: Philosophical Foundations of Autonomy

Understanding how AI affects workplace autonomy requires clarity about what autonomy is and why it matters. Philosophical traditions offer sophisticated accounts, though they disagree about fundamental questions: Is autonomy primarily about rational self-legislation (Kant), identification with one's desires (Frankfurt), responsiveness to reasons (Wolf), or participation in relationships of mutual recognition (Westlund)? These are not merely theoretical disputes—different conceptions have different implications for evaluating algorithmic management systems and workplace conditions.

## Classical Accounts: Kant and Mill

Two classical traditions establish autonomy's centrality to moral and political philosophy. Kant's (1785) account grounds autonomy in rational self-legislation: autonomous agents give themselves moral law through reason rather than being heteronomously governed by inclination or external authority. In the *Groundwork*, Kant argues that autonomy is "the ground of the dignity of human nature" (Kant 1785)—what makes persons ends in themselves rather than mere means. This conception emphasizes the capacity for rational reflection and action according to principles one legislates for oneself. Contemporary Kantian accounts (Korsgaard 2009) develop autonomy as self-constitution: through action, agents constitute their own agency and identity.

Kantian autonomy sets high standards. It requires not just absence of coercion but positive capacity for rational self-governance. Applied to work contexts, Cholbi (2020) argues that meaningful work must be "freely entered, affording workers opportunities to exercise independent judgment, allowing pursuit of own ends distinct from employer-mandated ends." This connects autonomy to workplace conditions: work that reduces workers to instruments executing others' decisions fails to respect their autonomy and dignity.

Mill's (1859) liberal tradition offers a different emphasis. *On Liberty* defends individual autonomy as essential for human flourishing and social progress, not just moral requirement. Mill argues for individuality, self-development, and "experiments in living" as crucial for both personal and collective advancement. Autonomy requires protection from both state coercion and "tyranny of the majority"—social pressure toward conformity that can be as constraining as legal sanctions. Mill's emphasis on variety, development, and resistance to conformity suggests that autonomy thrives when individuals can choose and pursue diverse life paths.

These classical accounts establish autonomy's importance but face challenges in workplace applications. Kantian autonomy's demanding rational requirements may exclude forms of agency that don't meet high cognitive standards (Benson 1994). Mill's individualism may overlook how social relationships and power structures shape the options available for choice. Both traditions were developed without contemporary technologies in mind, creating conceptual gaps when addressing algorithmic systems.

## Hierarchical Models: Frankfurt and Dworkin

Contemporary autonomy debates were transformed by Frankfurt's (1971) hierarchical model. Frankfurt introduces first-order desires (desires to do or not do something) versus second-order desires (desires about which desires to have). Crucially, he distinguishes second-order desires from second-order *volitions*—wanting a particular first-order desire to be effective in action. Free will, Frankfurt argues, requires this "mesh": having the will one wants to have, caring about one's motivational structure at a higher level.

Frankfurt's account makes autonomy compatible with determinism—what matters is internal hierarchical harmony, not independence from causal chains. The addict who wishes to be free of addiction but cannot escape its pull lacks free will not because determined but because of hierarchical conflict between first-order desire (for drug) and second-order volition (wanting not to be moved by that desire).

Dworkin (1988) develops Frankfurt's insights into a procedural autonomy theory. In *The Theory and Practice of Autonomy*, Dworkin argues that autonomy requires "procedural independence"—second-order identification with first-order desires formed through one's own reflection rather than manipulation. The account is procedural (not substantive) because it doesn't require having correct values, just authentic identification with whatever values one has. Procedural autonomy focuses on the *how* of preference formation, not the *what*.

Applied to workplaces, hierarchical accounts raise important questions: Do workers identify with their work motivations, or do they feel alienated from what they do? When organizational cultures shape employee values and goals, does this constitute manipulation that undermines autonomy? If algorithmic management systems use behavioral nudges and gamification to influence what workers want, does this violate procedural independence even if workers subsequently identify with induced preferences?

The challenge is distinguishing legitimate influence from autonomy-undermining manipulation. All socialization shapes desires—the question is which processes preserve versus violate autonomy. Hierarchical accounts struggle to specify this distinction clearly. As Mele (1995) argues, self-control (ability to resist conflicting desires) may be insufficient for autonomy if preferences were formed through problematic processes.

## Procedural versus Substantive Autonomy

Debates between procedural and substantive autonomy accounts structure contemporary discussions. Procedural accounts (Christman 2009; Dworkin 1988) hold that autonomy depends on *how* preferences form—through reflection, identification, and absence of manipulation—not on preference content. One can autonomously choose poorly. Substantive accounts (Raz 1986; Wolf 1990) argue that autonomy requires not just procedural conditions but adequate valuable options and some normative competence.

Raz's (1986) perfectionist liberalism in *The Morality of Freedom* argues that autonomy requires an adequate range of valuable options. Mere freedom from interference is insufficient if one lacks genuinely good life possibilities. This "options" account suggests workplaces must provide meaningful work opportunities, not just absence of coercion, for workers to be autonomous. Raz's perfectionism is controversial—who determines which options are valuable?—but it highlights that formal freedom may be hollow without substantive opportunities.

Wolf's (1990) "Reason View" in *Freedom Within Reason* charts middle ground. She argues that freedom requires not independence from all external influence but ability to appreciate and respond to reasons. Some external influences (good education, accurate information) enhance rather than threaten autonomy by developing capacities for reasonable judgment. This suggests workplace conditions that develop worker capabilities and provide good information support autonomy, while those that distort information or prevent development undermine it.

For workplace autonomy, the procedural-substantive divide matters practically. Purely procedural accounts might accept any preferences workers authentically endorse, including those formed under oppressive conditions. Substantive accounts can critique objectively poor work conditions but risk paternalism about what constitutes valuable work. The challenge is acknowledging social influence on preferences while maintaining critical capacity to distinguish supportive from undermining influences.

## Relational Autonomy: Social Constitution of Agency

Feminist philosophers have fundamentally challenged individualistic autonomy conceptions. The influential anthology *Relational Autonomy* (Mackenzie and Stoljar 2000) collects essays arguing that autonomy is constituted through social relationships rather than opposed to them. As Stoljar (2024) explains in her Stanford Encyclopedia entry on feminist autonomy perspectives, relational approaches show how oppression can impair autonomy through preference adaptation and internalized norms, not just external constraint.

Relational autonomy theorists (Friedman 2003; Meyers 1989; Westlund 2009) argue that traditional accounts wrongly presume atomistic, self-sufficient agents. Real human autonomy develops through relationships and depends on social conditions. Meyers (1989) conceptualizes autonomy as a repertoire of competencies developed socially over time—not an innate property but cultivated capacities. Benson (1994) argues that autonomous agency requires a sense of one's own worth that depends on social recognition and standing. When hierarchical relationships deny recognition or status, they undermine not just opportunities for autonomous action but the very capacity for it.

Westlund's (2009) dialogical account makes answerability to others constitutive of autonomy rather than threatening to it. Autonomous agents must be "answerable" to others—capable of dialogue and responsiveness to others' perspectives. This challenges views that autonomy means independence from others' input. Being held accountable within relationships can support rather than undermine self-governance.

For workplace autonomy, relational approaches provide crucial insights. Organizational cultures, power relations, and social recognition aren't just external factors affecting pre-formed autonomous agents—they constitute the conditions for autonomous agency itself. When workplace hierarchies systematically deny certain workers recognition (based on gender, race, class), they damage not just opportunities but the psychological and social prerequisites for autonomy (Oshana 2006). Algorithmic management systems that make workers invisible or reduce them to data points may undermine autonomy not through overt coercion but by denying the relational conditions autonomy requires.

Young's (2006) "social connection model" of structural injustice offers a complementary framework. She argues that individuals bear responsibility for structural processes they participate in and reproduce. Workers are both constrained by and complicit in organizational structures that distribute autonomy unequally. This highlights collective dimensions—transforming autonomy-undermining structures requires collective action, not just individual choices.

Contemporary relational autonomy work (Lee 2023) continues refining how to differentiate social influences conducive to agency from those that hinder it. The challenge is acknowledging social constitution while maintaining critical bite—not all social relations equally support autonomy. Oppressive socialization, manipulative influences, and dominating power relations undermine autonomy even when individuals are embedded in relationships.

## Contemporary Developments and Debates

Recent work extends autonomy theories to contemporary challenges. Two developments merit particular attention: conceptual engineering and technology-focused autonomy research.

Haslanger's (2012) ameliorative analysis in *Resisting Reality* revolutionizes conceptual methodology. Rather than analyzing concepts as they are, Haslanger asks what concepts ought to be given normative goals. For race and gender, she shows how ameliorated concepts better serve emancipatory aims. Applied to autonomy: instead of just analyzing what "autonomy" means, we should ask what autonomy concept would best serve our practical and ethical purposes in evaluating AI-mediated work. This licenses revising autonomy concepts based on empirical findings about what matters for human flourishing in contemporary conditions.

Very recent work (2024-2025) directly addresses AI's autonomy impacts. Two papers in philosophy journals examine how recommender systems and AI decision-support affect domain-specific autonomy (Anonymous 2025a, 2025b). This emerging literature recognizes that AI systems create novel threats and opportunities for autonomy requiring conceptual attention. However, most philosophical work on AI ethics has not yet deeply engaged with workplace autonomy specifically.

Bankins and Formosa (2023) provide important exception, analyzing AI's ethical implications for meaningful work in *Journal of Business Ethics*. They identify three AI deployment pathways affecting meaningful work: replacing tasks entirely, creating new "tending machine" roles, and amplifying human skills. Each pathway has different implications for autonomy, purpose, and dignity. Their framework demonstrates how philosophical analysis can engage productively with technological specifics.

## What Autonomy Requires: Synthesis

Despite disagreements, philosophical traditions converge on several requirements for autonomy:

1. **Information and transparency**: Agents need adequate information to make informed choices. Opacity and systematic deception undermine autonomy across nearly all accounts.

2. **Absence of domination and manipulation**: While accounts differ on permissible influence, all condemn manipulation that bypasses or subverts rational capacities and coercion through threats.

3. **Authentic endorsement**: Whether through identification (Frankfurt), procedural independence (Dworkin), or reflective endorsement (Christman), autonomy requires agents standing behind their choices, not merely being caused to act.

4. **Supportive social conditions**: Particularly for relational accounts, autonomy requires social recognition, adequate options, and relationships that develop rather than stunt agency.

5. **Capacity for reflection and revision**: Autonomous agents can reflect on their desires, values, and commitments, potentially revising them. Work conditions that prevent reflection or revision threaten autonomy.

These convergence points provide evaluative criteria for workplace technologies. Algorithmic management systems that create opacity, manipulate through behavioral nudges, deny recognition, limit options arbitrarily, or prevent reflection and revision threaten autonomy on multiple philosophical grounds. However, applying these general principles to specific sociotechnical systems requires empirical investigation of actual workplace conditions and worker experiences—a task philosophical work has largely not undertaken.
