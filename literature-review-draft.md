# Section 1: Introduction and Measurement Debates

Housing cost burdens in Germany present both an empirical phenomenon demanding explanation and a methodological puzzle requiring careful specification. This literature review examines what explains the proportion of income households spend on housing, with particular focus on Germany's context as a high-rent, low-homeownership economy. Germany's housing system is distinctive: 54% of households rent (Brookings 2021), significantly higher than most developed economies, and 12.0% of the population lived in households overburdened by housing costs in 2024—spending more than 40% of disposable income on housing—compared to an EU average of 8.2% (Destatis 2024). This burden is not distributed evenly. As Dustmann, Fitzenberger, and Zimmermann (2022) document in their landmark study, housing expenditure dramatically amplifies income inequality trends: while the 50/10 income ratio increased by 22 percentage points between 1993 and 2013, it rose by 62 percentage points when housing costs are incorporated. This three-fold amplification effect suggests that understanding housing burden requires examining both demand-side factors (wages, income distribution) and supply-side factors (urban housing costs, rent dynamics).

Yet before analyzing substantive patterns, we must confront a fundamental methodological challenge: how housing burden is measured shapes who counts as burdened and what interventions appear justified. The literature reveals profound disagreement about appropriate operationalization. Stone (2006) contrasts the traditional ratio approach—which classifies households as burdened if they spend more than 30% or 40% of income on housing—with a residual income approach that calculates money remaining after both housing and other necessary expenditures (food, clothing, medical care, transportation). In his analysis of 30.9 million U.S. renter households, the residual income measure identified 62.1% as cost-burdened while the traditional 30% ratio captured only 47.9%—a 14-percentage-point difference (Stone 2006). This gap matters: different measures identify different populations as policy priorities.

The 30% threshold itself reflects historical contingency rather than empirical necessity. Herbert, Hermann, and McCue (2013) trace its origins to U.S. public housing policy in the 1960s-1970s, noting it became the de facto standard despite limited justification for why 30% rather than 25% or 35% represents the boundary of affordability. The threshold fails to account for household size, composition, or local cost variations, creating a one-size-fits-all metric applied across vastly different contexts. European practice typically employs a 40% overburden threshold using equivalised disposable income adjusted for household composition via the modified OECD scale (Eurostat 2024), introducing different normative assumptions about household needs.

Subjective and objective burden measures reveal further complexity. Li and Xu (2022), analyzing 14 European countries, find that objective cost burden (percentage of income spent on housing) and subjective burden (whether households feel housing costs are burdensome) are related but overlap imperfectly. Some households with high objective burdens do not report feeling burdened; others with lower objective burdens experience significant financial stress. This suggests housing burden is not merely a technical calculation but reflects household priorities, expectations, and context-specific circumstances that standardized ratios cannot fully capture.

Even data sources introduce measurement variation. Frick and Krell (2010) compare Germany's two major household panel surveys—the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)—finding that methodological differences in income measurement, survey design, and post-collection treatment produce different burden distributions. Choices about whether to use gross versus net income, how to account for housing quality, and whether to include utilities all affect burden calculations (Whitehead 2021).

Haffner and Hulse (2021) argue that these measurement choices are not merely technical but reflect normatively laden policy priorities. Ratio approaches prioritize simplicity and cross-context comparability; residual income approaches prioritize accuracy to actual household needs; subjective measures prioritize lived experience. No measurement is value-neutral—each embodies assumptions about what constitutes "affordability" and who deserves policy attention.

The following sections report findings as stated in original studies while noting measurement approaches when relevant to interpretation. Most German and European studies employ ratio approaches with 30% or 40% thresholds, enabling cross-study comparison but potentially missing households captured by alternative measures. This measurement heterogeneity is itself a key finding: housing burden operationalization fundamentally shapes empirical conclusions and policy recommendations, confirming that measurement choice is normatively charged (Hypothesis 6).
# Section 2: Housing Burden Distribution - The Income Gradient

The distribution of housing cost burdens across German society reveals a stark income gradient: low-income households face severe burdens while higher-income households maintain moderate costs. This pattern is robust across measurement approaches, data sources, and time periods, providing strong support for Hypothesis 2 (high burdens for low-income urban dwellers) while offering mixed evidence for Hypothesis 1 (flat burdens for median incomes despite rising costs).

## The Income Gradient: Core Finding

Dustmann, Fitzenberger, and Zimmermann's (2022) analysis of German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and Income and Consumption Survey (EVS) data from 1993-2013 establishes the foundational finding: housing expenditure dramatically amplifies income inequality. They show that while the 50/10 income ratio increased by 22 percentage points over two decades, incorporating housing costs increased this gap to 62 percentage points—a three-fold amplification effect. This occurs because the income share devoted to housing rose disproportionately for the bottom income quintile while falling for the top quintile. Approximately 70% of individuals in the lowest income quintile are renters, while only one-third in the top quintile rent, creating differential exposure to rental cost increases (Dustmann et al. 2022).

European comparative data confirm this gradient's generality. The European Parliament (2024) reports that in 2023, EU households with income below 60% of national median spent 38.2% of disposable income on housing on average, while those above this threshold spent only 16.2%—more than a 20-percentage-point difference. The International Monetary Fund (2023) finds that almost half of the poorest households across EU countries are overburdened by housing costs (spending more than 40% of income on housing) irrespective of tenure status. Tenants in the bottom income quintile who rent at market prices spend more than 40% of disposable income on rents across most European countries. The OECD (2022) documents that in 26 countries, there is at least a 10-percentage-point difference between median housing cost burden of tenants in bottom and third income quintiles.

Germany's specific burden levels are notable. Destatis (2024) reports that 12.0% of Germany's population lived in households overburdened by housing costs in 2024, compared to an EU average of 8.2%. This higher-than-average overburden rate persists despite Germany's relatively high median incomes and extensive rental market protections. The gap suggests that structural features of German housing and labor markets create particular vulnerabilities for lower-income households.

Particular demographic groups exhibit especially severe burdens. DIW Berlin and the German Centre of Gerontology (2021) report that in 2016, elderly renter households (reference person 65+) spent an average of 34% of income on housing. Two-thirds of such households experienced high burden (30%+), and 38% faced overburden (40%+). This elderly renter burden represents dramatic increase from 1991, when nearly one in 20 Germans paid 40%+ of income on rent; by 2016, nearly one in six did so. Dewilde and Lancee (2024) analyze 27 European countries from 2010-2018, finding that the position of market renters deteriorated relative to mortgaged homeowners in terms of both housing cost burdens and low incomes, noting that Germany is one of just five countries where fewer than half of low-income private market tenants are overburdened when total housing costs are considered—suggesting German tenant protections provide some (though incomplete) buffer.

## Urban Housing Markets: Rising Costs and Supply Constraints

Urban areas concentrate housing burden problems through sustained rent increases and severe supply shortages. EmpiricaRegio (2024) documents that net rents in major German cities (A-cities: Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart) increased 70% between 2011 and 2024—a dramatic 13-year cumulative increase. This translates to low-income households facing 31% rent burden and median-income households facing 24% burden when signing new tenancy agreements in metropolitan areas. Stawarz et al. (2021), analyzing 401 German counties from 2004-2017, find that residential asking rents per square meter increased by approximately 4% per year between 2011-2017, representing a 26% cumulative increase. Rent-to-income ratios increase systematically with municipality size, confirming urban concentration of burden.

Recent market data show some moderation but continued increases. Cushman & Wakefield (2025) reports that Deutsche Bundesbank's apartment rent index showed 3.7% growth in 2024 compared to 5.0% in 2023, with the seven major cities experiencing slowdown from 6.0% to 3.5%. However, this represents slowing growth, not actual declines—rents continue rising from already-elevated levels. Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf showed increasing growth rates at end of 2024, while Berlin and Munich increases decelerated. Owner-occupied housing prices have fallen: Bundesbank (2023) reports declines of 5.8% to 9.9% year-over-year in Q3 2023 according to different indices, reflecting interest rate increases and market corrections. Yet rental market dynamics differ from ownership markets, and renters have not experienced corresponding burden relief.

Supply constraints underpin sustained urban rent growth. Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank (2024) calculates that Germany needs 320,000 new dwellings annually between 2023-2030, with Berlin requiring 23,000 per year and Munich 11,300. Actual housing completions remain well below the federal target of 400,000 units annually. Building permits issued fell by 27%. Production costs for residential buildings increased approximately 40% since 2020, with total costs in large cities exceeding €5,000 per square meter. Munich exhibits the lowest vacancy rate at just 0.2%, reflecting extreme supply-demand imbalance.

Berlin illustrates displacement dynamics in tight urban markets. Berger and Aubry (2024) surveyed 1,200+ Berlin households, finding that more than 15% experienced direct displacement, with rent increases after refurbishment or property sales proving most common triggers. Berlin gains 40,000 inhabitants annually but constructs only 15,000 new dwellings, creating a 25,000-unit annual gap that intensifies competition for existing housing. GlobalProperty (2025) reports Berlin achieved the highest cumulative value increase since 2000 at approximately 160% adjusted for inflation. Urban centers like Berlin and Munich struggle with vacancy rates around 2%, while eastern rural Germany maintains 7.6% vacancy—a stark spatial divide.

## Testing H1: Flat Burdens for Median Incomes?

Hypothesis 1 proposed that median-income households maintain relatively stable housing cost burdens despite rising urban rents through spatial adjustment mechanisms. Evidence is mixed. EmpiricaRegio (2024) finds median-income households pay approximately 24% of net income on rent when signing new tenancy agreements in metropolitan areas—below the 30% burden threshold but rising from earlier periods. Stawarz et al. (2021) document that rent-to-income ratios increase with city size, suggesting median incomes are affected by urban cost dynamics. Stephens, Lux, and Sunega (2015) note that German and Swedish median households pay more than 16% of disposable income on living costs, high by international standards, though this includes both owners and renters and may reflect Germany's high-quality housing stock.

Three adjustment mechanisms may explain why median-income burden appears more stable than low-income burden despite rising urban costs:

**Migration responses**: Stawarz et al. (2021) demonstrate that regions with rising housing costs experience declining inflows and, in larger cities, increasing outflows. Rising housing costs act as barriers to migration into high-opportunity urban areas. This suggests that median-income households facing unaffordable urban rents may leave rather than accept higher burdens, creating spatial selection where only those who can afford urban rents remain.

**Tenure structure**: Germany's housing system creates buffers for some median-income households. Kaas et al. (2021) show that homeownership rates reach 45% overall but only 22% for bottom income quintile households, implying higher rates for middle-income groups. Homeowners face housing costs primarily through mortgages and maintenance rather than market rents, providing partial insulation from rental market dynamics. Voigtländer (2009) explains Germany's distinctive tenure system: extensive social housing sector (though declining), high real estate transfer taxes (5-6%), no mortgage interest deductibility, and large, non-stigmatized rental market. This institutional context shapes who faces direct exposure to rising rents.

**Displacement**: Berger and Aubry (2024) document that 15% of Berlin residents experienced displacement, concentrated among renters and lower-income households. If displacement primarily affects lower-income households unable to sustain rising burdens, median-income households' aggregate burden statistics may appear stable through compositional effects—those who would show high burdens leave the urban sample through displacement or migration.

**Assessment of H1**: Evidence provides partial but qualified support. Median-income households do maintain lower burdens than low-income households (24% vs. 31% in EmpiricaRegio data), and there are hints that spatial adjustment mechanisms operate. However, the stability may be artifact of selection—median incomes maintaining moderate burdens by avoiding or leaving high-cost cities—rather than genuine stability for households remaining in place. No longitudinal study tracks the same median-income households within cities over time to test whether their burdens remain stable or increase. Cross-sectional data showing moderate median burdens are consistent with either true stability or continuous displacement of those experiencing rising burdens. This ambiguity leaves H1 with mixed support.

## Summary: Income Gradient Robust, Urban Pressures Intense

The income gradient in housing burden is quantitatively large and robust across studies: low-income households face burdens 20+ percentage points higher than higher-income households, with roughly half of poorest households overburdened across Europe. Germany's 12% overburden rate exceeds the EU 8.2% average despite relatively high incomes, suggesting structural vulnerabilities. Urban housing costs rose 70% in major cities between 2011-2024, driven by severe supply constraints (need 320,000 units/year, falling short; Munich 0.2% vacancy; Berlin gaining 40,000 residents annually but building only 15,000 units). Median-income households may maintain moderate burdens through spatial adjustment—migration away from expensive cities, displacement of those who can't afford rising costs—rather than true stability in place.

Hypothesis 2 (high burdens for low-income urban dwellers) receives strong empirical support: every study confirms substantial and growing burdens for bottom income quintiles. Hypothesis 1 (flat burdens for median incomes) receives mixed support: median burdens appear more moderate, but this may reflect selection effects rather than stable in-place experiences. The next section examines whether income-side factors—wage stagnation, public sector wages, labor market dualization—explain these burden patterns.
# Section 3: Labor Market Determinants - Wages, Dualization, and the Public Sector

If housing burden distribution reflects both housing supply constraints and household incomes, then wage dynamics should substantially explain burden variation. Three hypotheses address income-side determinants: Hypothesis 3 (public sector wage repression affects housing burden), Hypothesis 4 (80%+ of burden change explained by wage income changes), and Hypothesis 5 (housing burden determined by dualized housing and labor markets). The evidence reveals complex patterns: wage stagnation post-2000 coincides with burden increases, but public sector wages kept pace on average; dualization theory provides comprehensive framework but lacks direct German quantification of housing impacts; and housing policy's limited effectiveness suggests structural labor market factors dominate.

## Wage Stagnation and Decline (2000-2015)

German wage dynamics from 2000-2015 created conditions conducive to rising housing burdens. The International Monetary Fund (2015) documents that the Hartz IV labor market reform reduced real wages by approximately 4%, with decline strongest at the 25th and 50th percentiles of the wage distribution. This reform coincided with a prolonged period of negative average wage growth. Dustmann et al. (2014) show that after 1999, wage gains no longer kept pace with productivity: total labor compensation fell from 61% of GDP in 2001 to 55% in 2007, representing a substantial shift in income distribution away from wages. In late 1990s, labor unions explicitly declared willingness to accept real wage stagnation in exchange for job creation.

International comparison highlights Germany's exceptional wage restraint. Bosch (2017) calculates that Germany achieved a 2% reduction in unit labor costs between 2000 and 2007, while all other OECD countries averaged a 22% increase—a 24-percentage-point divergence. This wage moderation was not uniform across sectors: unit labor costs grew much faster in manufacturing and financial sectors and much slower in construction, public sector, and low-end services. Hassel (2014) characterizes the wage restraint in low-end services as "exceptional in western Europe," arguing that liberalization led Germany to increasingly resemble a liberal market economy in service sectors where weak workers' wages depend on price mechanisms.

Collective bargaining decline contributed to wage dispersion. Addison et al. (2014) document that sectoral collective bargaining coverage decreased by 14 percentage points in western Germany and 18 percentage points in eastern Germany between 1996 and 2009. By 2009, only 56% of employees in western Germany and 38% in eastern Germany worked in establishments covered by sectoral collective agreements. Entering a collective agreement increases average wages by 3-3.5%, while abandoning one decreases wages by 3-4%, creating significant distributional effects. Biewen and Seckler (2018) decompose rising wage inequality, showing that de-unionization accounts for a substantial portion of increased wage dispersion. This distributional pattern—declining wages concentrated at lower percentiles—directly maps onto housing burden patterns where bottom quintiles face rapidly rising burdens.

Dustmann et al. (2022) establish the crucial connection: the income share devoted to housing rose disproportionately for the bottom income quintile while falling for the top quintile. This suggests that wage stagnation 2000-2015, particularly for lower-wage workers, contributed materially to housing burden increases. However, no study directly quantifies what proportion of burden variation wage changes explain. Hypothesis 4's proposition that "80%+ of burden change is explained by wage income changes" receives indirect support through temporal coincidence—wage declines 2000-2015 coincide with burden increases—but lacks explicit decomposition. The literature documents both wage stagnation and burden increases but stops short of variance decomposition that would attribute causal proportions.

## Public Sector Wages: Mixed Evidence

Hypothesis 3 proposed that public sector wage repression contributes to housing burden. Evidence does not support systematic public sector wage repression in aggregate. Deutsche Bundesbank (2024) reports that from 2009 to 2018, collective earnings in the public sector rose by approximately 24% in nominal terms, compared to 25% for the economy as a whole—essentially identical growth rates. The public sector experienced particularly high wage increases in 2022 (federal and local government) and 2023 (states), outstripping even the metal industry. Real wage losses from the inflation period 2021-2023 have now been largely recouped, with wages rising sharply and continuing strong growth in 2024.

However, institutional structure creates heterogeneity within the public sector. Schmidt and Müller (2024) identify a dual employment system: civil servants (Beamte) without collective bargaining or strike rights versus public sector employees with strong union bargaining power. Civil servants' pay is determined by government without negotiation, creating rigid compensation structures (Keller and Kirsch 2020). The IFO Institute (2020) argues that rigid pay scales make the public sector not attractive enough for recruiting skilled workers, predicting a need for approximately 1 million public sector employees by 2030 amid competition with private companies. This suggests structural pay constraints for specific public sector groups, even if aggregate public sector wages kept pace.

The contrast with private sector developments is instructive. Schmidt and Müller (2024) document that Germany's wage negotiation system has been losing importance for years in the private sector, while showing no signs of erosion in collective bargaining in the public sector. Eichhorst and Marx (2015) characterize labor market duality as partially attributed to reforms promoting non-standard employment and expanding low pay in the private sector, with dualization supporting disinflation by creating low-wage sectors and fostering intra-firm competition as a disciplinary device encouraging wage moderation. Approximately 3.6 million employees work in Germany's public sector, with more than 2.5 million covered by TVöD (Tarifvertrag für den öffentlichen Dienst), maintaining relatively strong bargaining structures compared to private sector erosion (Boeckler 2024).

**Assessment of H3**: The hypothesis receives limited support. Public sector wages kept pace with overall economy growth 2009-2018, and recent years show public sector wage gains outstripping private sector in some cases. There is no evidence of systematic wage repression for public sector workers that would disproportionately affect their housing burdens. However, civil servants face distinct institutional constraints through rigid government-determined pay without negotiation rights. The critical gap is that no study directly compares housing burdens of public versus private sector workers at similar income levels, controlling for relevant factors. The available evidence suggests that if public sector workers face elevated housing burdens, it is not primarily through wage repression but through factors common to all workers at their income levels.

## Dualization Theory: Linking Labor and Housing Markets

Hypothesis 5 proposes that housing burden is determined by dualized housing and labor markets, drawing on political economy literature identifying insider-outsider divides in continental European welfare states. This theoretical framework provides the most comprehensive account of structural factors affecting burden distribution, though empirical quantification for Germany remains incomplete.

The dualization framework's foundations are established by Palier and Thelen (2010), who demonstrate that French and German political economies have been significantly reconfigured over the past two decades, with dualism now "explicitly underwritten by state policy." They trace how the OECD's 1990s job strategy was implemented not for all workers but for secondary labor markets, while job protection increased for shrinking core sectors, producing institutionalized but distinctly less egalitarian models. Dualization begins in industrial relations, moves into labor market dynamics, and finds institutional expression in welfare state reforms.

Emmenegger et al. (2012) provide the comprehensive theoretical synthesis in *The Age of Dualization*, showing that poverty, inequality, and social exclusion have structural roots in seemingly permanent trends toward dualization since the 1970s. They define dualization as a political process characterized by differential treatment of insiders and outsiders, taking forms of newly created institutional dualisms or deepening existing ones. Comparative analysis reveals that Nordic countries witness lower insider-outsider divides, whereas continental, liberal, and southern welfare states show divides as core characteristics of political economy. Continental and southern European regimes perpetuate and reinforce insider-outsider divides across three dimensions: industrial relations (covered vs. uncovered by collective bargaining), labor market policy (employment protection for permanent vs. temporary workers), and welfare state access (contribution-based vs. residual entitlements).

Several mechanisms operate dualization. Schwander (2019) focuses on increasing disparities between securely employed market insiders and expanding proportions of market outsiders with precarious employment. Rueda (2005) demonstrates that insider-outsider politics structures political conflict, with social democratic parties facing trade-offs between core insider constituencies and broader working classes including outsiders. Emmenegger (2009) shows that strong unions and left governments protect insiders while being less responsive to outsiders. Davidsson and Emmenegger (2013) argue that unions often prioritize organizational survival over broad membership interests, contributing to dualization persistence. Biegert (2019) provides comparative evidence that institutions protecting labor market insiders—employment protection, unionization, unemployment benefits—are frequently associated with greater inequality between disadvantaged groups and insider peers. Continental Europe shows strongest insider-outsider divides regarding labor market inequalities, welfare inequalities, and political integration. Welfare regimes reinforce labor market dualism through taxes and transfers: net wage gaps lie 5-8 percentage points above gross wage gaps in continental Europe.

Marx (2012) identifies institutional complementarities across industrial relations, labor market, and welfare state, showing how changes in one domain reinforce dualization in others. Häusermann and Schwander (2012) demonstrate that continental European countries, including Germany, exhibit the strongest forms of employment-based dualization, with insider protection combined with outsider flexibility characterizing Germany's specific trajectory.

The crucial connection to housing comes through Lennartz and Helbrecht (2020), who explicitly link insider-outsider divides in employment to housing outcomes. They demonstrate that similar trends appear in housing markets across advanced economies as in labor markets, with employment precarity (outsider status) affecting housing tenure choice and housing cost burden. Outsiders face higher rent burdens, reduced access to homeownership, and greater displacement risk. This creates systematic connection between labor market position and housing outcomes.

Supporting this connection, multiple housing factors interact with dualization. Brezina and Saischek (2011) document social housing proportion falling dramatically: from 2.6 million units (2002) to 1.4 million (2014), an annual loss exceeding 41,000 units due to expiring price controls. Subsidy periods reduced from up to 50 years historically to 10-15 years recently. Elimination of tax benefits for non-profit corporations in 1988 propelled this decline. Large-scale privatization to institutional investors transformed rental markets. Holm et al. (2021) show Berlin's social housing declined from 360,000 units (1990) to approximately 100,000 (2020). Habitat for Humanity (2021) reports overall German social housing fell from 4 million (1980s) to roughly 1 million today.

Rent control shows limited effectiveness. Kholodilin, Mense, and Michelsen (2016) evaluate the 2015 Mietpreisbremse (rent brake) using difference-in-differences, finding it reduced offered rents in Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich by up to 5% initially, but this effect vanished approximately one year after implementation, illustrating significant implementation deficit. Thomschke (2019) confirms effects lagging behind expectations and vanishing over time. Baye and Dinger (2024) argue that rent control promotes gentrification and amplifies supply shortage by causing negative effects on yields for regulated rental objects while raising yields for exempted objects, shifting rental housing supply away from regulated segments.

Housing benefits provide limited reach. Jagemann (2022) documents that the Housing Benefit Plus Act (January 2023) doubled housing benefits from €190 to €370 per month on average and doubled recipients, but the program reaches only 550,000-1,100,000 households—a fraction of those experiencing burden.

**Assessment of H5**: Dualization theory receives strong theoretical support as framework for understanding housing burden. The literature establishes: (1) comprehensive dualization framework showing state-supported insider-outsider divides in Germany (Palier & Thelen, Emmenegger et al.); (2) explicit conceptual link between labor market status and housing outcomes (Lennartz & Helbrecht); (3) institutional complementarities across industrial relations, labor markets, welfare state, and housing policy (Marx). However, a critical empirical gap persists: no German study directly tests whether labor market insider/outsider status predicts housing burden levels after controlling for income. The framework is conceptually compelling and supported by indirect evidence—Dewilde showing market renters' deteriorating position, Dustmann showing bottom quintile burden rising, wage stagnation literature showing outsiders face wage penalties—but lacks quantified decomposition showing how much of housing burden variation labor market status explains independently of income level.

## Housing Policy Effectiveness: Structural Factors Dominant

The limited effectiveness of housing-side policy interventions provides indirect support for Hypotheses 4 and 5 by suggesting that structural labor market factors dominate burden determination. If rent control, social housing, and housing benefits all show modest effects, then income-side factors (wages, dualization) likely matter more.

The evidence pattern is consistent: rent control reduces rents by 5% initially but effects vanish within a year (Kholodilin et al. 2016; Thomschke 2019); social housing declined from 4 million to 1 million units (Habitat 2021; Brezina & Saischek 2011); housing benefits reach only 550,000-1,100,000 households despite being doubled (Jagemann 2022). Even Berlin's dramatic 2020 rent freeze, subsequently ruled unconstitutional, produced only temporary effects. These limited outcomes suggest that addressing housing burden may require labor market interventions—wage policies, reducing dualization, strengthening collective bargaining—rather than relying solely on housing-side policies.

## Summary: Labor Market Primacy Plausible but Unquantified

Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coincides temporally with housing burden increases, creating strong circumstantial case for causal connection (H4 plausible but not directly quantified). Public sector wages kept pace with overall economy on average, though civil servants face rigid determination (H3 not supported in aggregate). Dualization theory provides comprehensive framework linking labor market insider-outsider status to housing outcomes through institutional complementarities (H5 strong theoretical framework but empirical gap on direct quantification). Housing policy's limited effectiveness suggests structural labor market factors may be more determinative than housing supply interventions.

Two critical gaps emerge: First, no decomposition study quantifies what proportion of housing burden variation wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition changes explain—the "80%+ wage explanation" in H4 lacks empirical test. Second, no study directly tests whether labor market status (insider/outsider) predicts housing burden after controlling for income level—H5's mechanism lacks German quantification. The next section synthesizes these findings and identifies specific research priorities.
# Section 4: Research Gaps and Synthesis

This review examined what explains housing cost burdens in Germany through the lens of six hypotheses spanning measurement methodology (H6), burden distribution (H1, H2), and labor market determinants (H3, H4, H5). The evidence reveals a pattern: some questions receive strong empirical support, others remain plausible but unquantified, and critical gaps persist where existing studies stop short of direct hypothesis tests.

## Hypothesis Assessment Summary

**H6 (Measurement normatively charged)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Stone (2006) demonstrates that residual income approaches identify 62.1% of households as burdened versus 47.9% by traditional 30% ratio—a 14-percentage-point difference that determines policy priorities. Li and Xu (2022) show subjective and objective burden overlap imperfectly. Haffner and Hulse (2021) establish that measurement choices reflect normative priorities rather than value-neutral technical decisions. This finding is foundational: it means all subsequent findings must be interpreted in light of measurement approaches used.

**H2 (High burdens for low-income urban dwellers)**: STRONGLY SUPPORTED. Every study confirms substantial income gradients. European Parliament (2024) reports 38.2% burden for low-income versus 16.2% for higher-income EU households. IMF (2023) finds almost half of poorest households overburdened regardless of tenure. Dustmann et al. (2022) document housing amplifying inequality three-fold (22pp→62pp). DIW (2021) shows two-thirds of elderly renters experience 30%+ burden. The evidence is quantitatively large, robust across measures, and consistent across studies.

**H1 (Flat median-income burdens despite rising costs)**: MIXED EVIDENCE. EmpiricaRegio (2024) finds median-income households pay 24% in metropolitan areas—below 30% threshold but rising. However, three adjustment mechanisms confound interpretation: migration (Stawarz et al. 2021 show rising costs reduce inflows, increase outflows), tenure structure (Kaas et al. 2021 show homeownership buffers some median incomes), and displacement (Berger & Aubry 2024 show 15% Berlin displacement). Cross-sectional data showing moderate median burdens may reflect continuous displacement of those experiencing rising burdens rather than true in-place stability. No longitudinal study tracks same households over time to test stability directly.

**H4 (80%+ wage explanation)**: PLAUSIBLE BUT NOT QUANTIFIED. Temporal evidence strongly supports wage role: IMF (2015) documents Hartz IV reduced real wages ~4%, Dustmann et al. (2014) show labor compensation falling 61%→55% of GDP (2001-2007), Bosch (2017) calculates Germany achieved -2% unit labor costs while OECD averaged +22%. Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coincides with burden increases, and Dustmann et al. (2022) establish housing's income share rose for bottom quintile. However, no decomposition study attributes proportions: what % of burden variation comes from wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition? The "80%+" figure lacks empirical test.

**H3 (Public sector wage repression)**: NOT SUPPORTED IN AGGREGATE. Bundesbank (2024) shows public sector wages rose 24% versus economy-wide 25% (2009-2018), essentially identical growth. Recent years show public sector outpacing private sector. Schmidt and Müller (2024) document strong collective bargaining maintained in public sector while eroding in private sector. Civil servants face rigid pay determination (Keller & Kirsch 2020), but no evidence of systematic aggregate repression affecting housing burden. Critical gap: no study directly compares housing burdens of public versus private sector workers at similar income levels.

**H5 (Dualization explains burden)**: STRONG THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK, EMPIRICAL GAP. Palier and Thelen (2010) establish dualism "explicitly underwritten by state policy" in Germany. Emmenegger et al. (2012) provide comprehensive framework showing insider-outsider divides across industrial relations, labor market policy, and welfare state. Lennartz and Helbrecht (2020) explicitly link labor market dualization to housing outcomes. Marx (2012) identifies institutional complementarities reinforcing dualization. Framework is theoretically robust and conceptually compelling. However, critical empirical gap: no German study tests whether labor market insider/outsider status predicts housing burden after controlling for income level. Indirect evidence supports the link, but direct quantification is absent.

## Critical Research Gaps

**Decomposition analysis (H4)**: Need variance decomposition quantifying what proportion of housing burden variation wage changes versus rent changes versus household composition changes explain. Dustmann et al. (2022) show housing amplifies inequality but don't quantify relative contributions. Requires longitudinal data tracking households over time with detailed income and rent information.

**Labor market status and burden (H5)**: Need study testing whether labor market insider/outsider status (permanent vs. temporary contracts, collective bargaining coverage, employment protection) predicts housing burden controlling for income level. Would directly test dualization theory's housing implications. Requires combining SOEP employment data with housing cost data using appropriate statistical controls.

**Public-private sector comparison (H3)**: Need study comparing housing burdens of public sector workers versus private sector workers at same income levels, controlling for location, household composition, tenure status. Schmidt and Müller (2024) and Keller and Kirsch (2020) establish institutional differences, but burden outcomes remain untested.

**Median-income longitudinal stability (H1)**: Need longitudinal study tracking same median-income households within cities over time, not cross-sectional snapshots. Would distinguish true stability from spatial selection via migration and displacement. Requires residential mobility analysis with individual-level tracking.

## Synthesis: What Explains Housing Burden?

Strong evidence establishes that income level is the primary determinant of housing burden, with bottom quintiles facing burdens 20+ percentage points higher than top quintiles. This income gradient is robust across measurement approaches, data sources, and time periods (H2 strongly supported). Measurement operationalization fundamentally shapes who counts as burdened and policy priorities (H6 strongly supported).

Wage stagnation 2000-2015 likely contributed substantially to burden increases: timing coincides, magnitude matches (4% real wage decline from Hartz IV, 6pp GDP share shift), and distributional pattern aligns (wage losses concentrated at lower percentiles where burden rises most). However, precise quantification is lacking (H4 plausible but unquantified).

Dualization theory provides the most comprehensive framework for understanding structural determinants. It links industrial relations erosion, labor market deregulation, welfare state retrenchment, and housing marketization through institutional complementarities. The framework is theoretically sophisticated and enjoys strong conceptual support, but empirical quantification for Germany remains incomplete (H5 strong theory, empirical gap).

Public sector wage patterns do not support hypothesis of systematic repression driving housing burdens (H3 not supported), and median-income burden stability claims are confounded by spatial selection effects (H1 mixed evidence).

Housing policy's limited effectiveness—rent control effects vanish within a year (Kholodilin et al. 2016), social housing declined 4 million→1 million units (Habitat 2021), housing benefits reach limited populations (Jagemann 2022)—suggests structural labor market factors may be more determinative than housing supply interventions. This pattern indirectly supports labor market primacy (H4, H5), though direct tests remain absent.

The answer to "what explains housing burden?" emerges: burden is determined primarily by income level, with bottom quintiles severely affected. Wage stagnation 2000-2015 coinciding with burden increases suggests income-side factors substantially contribute. Dualization theory provides plausible structural framework linking labor market precarity to housing vulnerability. But precise causal decomposition—how much wage vs. rent vs. composition, whether labor market status independently predicts burden controlling for income—awaits empirical investigation. The literature documents correlations and establishes frameworks; it has not yet quantified causal mechanisms.
