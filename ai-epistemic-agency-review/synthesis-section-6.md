## Conclusion: Research Gaps and Future Directions

This review has mapped a rapidly developing but still fragmentary philosophical literature on AI and epistemic agency. While scholars increasingly recognize AI's epistemic significance, systematic frameworks for understanding population-level belief revision through rationally-mediated AI interaction remain critically underdeveloped. Several major research gaps emerge from our synthesis.

### Persistent Conceptual Ambiguities

First, the fundamental tension between preservation and transformation of epistemic agency persists across literatures. Some scholars argue AI necessarily diminishes epistemic agency by displacing human reasoning (Coeckelbergh 2025), others propose frameworks for responsible AI extension (Naeem & Hauser 2024), while still others advocate distributed or shared epistemic agency models (Wu et al. 2025). Yet these positions remain largely parallel rather than engaged in systematic debate. We lack agreed-upon criteria for assessing when AI systems preserve, enhance, or undermine epistemic agency—let alone consensus on whether traditional conceptions of individual epistemic agency remain appropriate for sociotechnical environments.

Second, the distinction between rational persuasion and manipulation in AI-human interaction remains severely underdeveloped. While democratic implications receive substantial attention (Coeckelbergh 2022, 2025; Wright 2025; Wihbey 2024), explicit normative frameworks for distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate AI influence on belief formation are largely absent. We can identify intuitive cases—transparent engagement with evidence differs from hidden exploitation of cognitive biases—but systematic accounts of what makes AI-prompted belief revision rational versus manipulative remain elusive. This gap proves especially troubling given the scale and speed of AI deployment in spaces of public belief formation.

### Empirical and Normative Disconnects

Third, the literature reveals significant disconnect between empirical cognitive science research and normative philosophical analysis. Work on theory of mind in LLMs (Strachan et al. 2024; Nature 2025; Chen et al. 2025) documents impressive functional capabilities for modeling human beliefs and reasoning patterns. Yet philosophical work rarely engages these empirical findings to develop normative frameworks. When do ToM capabilities enable rational persuasion by identifying genuine gaps in reasoning, versus enabling manipulation through strategic exploitation of cognitive patterns? Current literature provides limited guidance.

Similarly, research on epistemic humility and metacognition (Philosophy & Technology 2024; Medicine/Philosophy 2025) identifies potential for AI systems to trigger productive second-order reflection. Yet whether AI-induced epistemic humility represents genuine insight or strategic undermining of epistemic confidence remains undertheorized. The cognitive mechanisms literature illuminates possibilities without resolving normative questions about when such mechanisms operate legitimately.

### Population-Level Dynamics

Fourth, while work on democratic implications increasingly addresses population-level effects (Wright 2025 on cognitive castes; Wihbey 2024 on epistemic capture; AI & Society 2025 on algorithmic truth), most epistemological analysis remains focused on individual belief formation. Questions about how AI systems reshape collective epistemic practices, public knowledge formation, and population-level belief distributions receive less systematic attention than individual epistemic agency. Yet the research question motivating much recent work—how AI affects democratic citizenship—requires understanding population dynamics that individual epistemology may not adequately capture.

Finally, domain-specific insights remain largely isolated. Scientific practice raises fundamental questions about opacity, trust, and functional integration (Duede 2023; Zakharova 2025; Koskinen 2023) with clear relevance to public epistemology. Work on epistemic injustice reveals power dynamics in AI-mediated belief formation (Kay et al. 2024; Milano & Prunkl 2024) applicable beyond specific marginalized communities. Yet cross-domain synthesis remains limited, with different literatures developing parallel rather than integrated analyses.

### Forward Directions

These gaps reveal substantial space for research on how AI chatbots can impact epistemic agency by engaging rational faculties to shift beliefs at population level. Particular needs include: systematic normative frameworks distinguishing rational persuasion from manipulation; empirical studies of AI-prompted belief revision mechanisms; integration of individual and collective epistemology; cross-domain synthesis connecting scientific, political, and everyday epistemology; and attention to the specific phenomenon of AI revealing epistemic limitations (making us realize we know less) as distinct from traditional persuasion or deception.

The rapid sophistication of LLMs and their deployment across domains of public belief formation makes these questions urgent. Current philosophical work provides essential conceptual resources and identifies key tensions, but systematic frameworks for understanding and evaluating AI-mediated belief revision at scale remain works in progress. As AI systems increasingly shape what becomes public knowledge, philosophical clarity about the conditions under which such shaping preserves rather than displaces epistemic agency becomes not merely academic but democratically essential.
