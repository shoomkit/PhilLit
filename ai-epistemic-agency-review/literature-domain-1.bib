@comment{DOMAIN 1: EPISTEMIC AGENCY THEORIES AND AI}
@comment{===================================================================}
@comment{
Domain Focus: This domain examines how AI systems challenge, preserve,
or transform epistemic agency - the capacity for autonomous belief
formation and revision. Key themes include: the relationship between
AI-assisted reasoning and epistemic autonomy, how AI chatbots can
engage rational faculties while potentially diminishing agency, and
whether AI can enhance epistemic capacity while shifting beliefs.

Search Strategy: SEP (epistemic agency, autonomy), PhilPapers
("epistemic agency" + AI), epistemology journals (Episteme,
Philosophical Studies, Social Epistemology), Philosophy & Technology

Key Questions:
- What constitutes epistemic agency in traditional epistemology?
- How do AI systems challenge or preserve epistemic agency?
- Can AI chatbots enhance epistemic agency while shifting beliefs?
- What's the relationship between autonomous belief formation and
  AI-assisted reasoning?
