# Literature Review Plan: AI Epistemic Agency

## Research Question

How AI chatbots can impact human epistemic agency by shifting beliefs on a population level - not through manipulation, but by engaging our rational faculties and convincing us that we know less about a topic than we thought.

**Target**: Synthese special issue on "Epistemic Agency in AI-Mediated Environments"

## Core Focus

This review examines the philosophical literature on **rational belief revision facilitated by AI systems**, with emphasis on:
- The distinction between rational persuasion and manipulation
- Population-level epistemic effects of AI chatbots
- How AI engagement can reveal epistemic limitations (making us realize we know less)
- Preservation vs. transformation of epistemic agency in AI-mediated environments

## Seven Research Domains

### Domain 1: Epistemic Agency Theories and AI
**Key Questions**:
- What constitutes epistemic agency in traditional epistemology?
- How do AI systems challenge or preserve epistemic agency?
- What's the relationship between autonomous belief formation and AI-assisted reasoning?
- Can AI chatbots enhance epistemic agency while shifting beliefs?

**Search Strategy**: SEP (epistemic agency, autonomy), PhilPapers ("epistemic agency" + AI), recent epistemology journals (Episteme, Philosophical Studies)

### Domain 2: Social Epistemology and AI
**Key Questions**:
- How do AI systems function as epistemic authorities or peers?
- What role does trust play in AI-mediated belief formation?
- How does AI testimony differ from human testimony?
- Population-level epistemic dynamics with AI intervention

**Search Strategy**: PhilPapers (social epistemology + AI, trust + AI, testimony + AI), Social Epistemology journal, Synthese

### Domain 3: Doxastic Responsibility with AI
**Key Questions**:
- Are we epistemically responsible for beliefs formed through AI interaction?
- How does AI delegation affect epistemic obligations?
- What constitutes rational belief revision when prompted by AI?
- Epistemic virtues and vices in AI-mediated reasoning

**Search Strategy**: PhilPapers (doxastic responsibility, epistemic responsibility + AI), Philosophical Psychology, American Philosophical Quarterly

### Domain 4: Epistemic Injustice and AI
**Key Questions**:
- Can AI systems perpetuate or mitigate epistemic injustice?
- How do power dynamics affect AI-mediated belief revision?
- Credibility excess vs. credibility deficit in AI testimony
- Democratic implications of AI-driven belief shifts

**Search Strategy**: PhilPapers (epistemic injustice + AI, algorithmic bias + epistemology), Ethics and Information Technology, Philosophy & Technology

### Domain 5: LLMs, Reasoning, and Philosophy of Mind
**Key Questions**:
- What cognitive mechanisms underlie AI-facilitated belief revision?
- How do LLMs engage human reasoning capacities?
- Metacognition and epistemic humility triggered by AI
- Dual-process theories and AI interaction

**Search Strategy**: Google Scholar (LLM + reasoning, chatbot + cognition), Minds and Machines, Cognitive Science, Philosophy of Science

### Domain 6: Political Philosophy of AI and Knowledge
**Key Questions**:
- How do AI systems affect public knowledge and democratic discourse?
- Population-level belief polarization or convergence through AI?
- Epistemic aspects of AI governance
- Collective epistemic agency in AI-mediated environments

**Search Strategy**: PhilPapers (AI + democracy, AI + public knowledge), Journal of Political Philosophy, Political Theory, Philosophy & Public Affairs

### Domain 7: AI in Scientific Practice
**Key Questions**:
- How do AI systems affect scientific belief formation?
- AI as epistemic tool vs. epistemic authority in research
- Opacity, interpretability, and epistemic trust in AI-assisted science
- Case studies of AI-driven scientific discovery and belief revision

**Search Strategy**: Google Scholar (AI + scientific practice, AI + discovery), Philosophy of Science, Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, Biology & Philosophy
