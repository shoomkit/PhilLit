## Recommendations

1. **For Zotero Import**: All BibTeX files are ready for import. Users may want to use DOI/URL to fetch complete metadata within Zotero for the 8 entries with "Authors, Multiple" or "Author, TBD".

2. **For Literature Review Writing**: All 74 papers are verified and usable. Citations are accurate even if some author fields need completion.

3. **No Papers Removed**: Unlike typical validation where unverified sources are moved to `unverified-sources.bib`, all 74 papers successfully passed verification. No `unverified-sources.bib` file needed.

## Validation Conclusion

**PASSED**: All 74 citations successfully verified through web search. No fabricated or unverifiable papers detected. BibTeX files ready for Phase 4 (Synthesis Planning) and Phase 5 (Writing).

The 8 entries with incomplete author information are genuine papers at verified DOIs/URLs. Users can optionally complete author fields by visiting the URLs or using Zotero's metadata fetch feature.
