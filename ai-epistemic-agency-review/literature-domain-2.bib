@comment{DOMAIN 2: SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY AND AI}
@comment{===================================================================}
@comment{
Domain Focus: This domain examines AI systems as epistemic authorities,
peers, or tools within social knowledge production. Key themes include:
epistemic trust in AI systems, AI testimony vs human testimony,
algorithmic authority and its legitimacy, social practices of
AI-mediated knowledge, and population-level epistemic dynamics.

Search Strategy: PhilPapers (social epistemology + AI, trust + AI,
testimony + AI), Social Epistemology journal, Synthese, AI & Society

Key Questions:
- How do AI systems function as epistemic authorities or peers?
- What role does trust play in AI-mediated belief formation?
- How does AI testimony differ from human testimony?
- What are population-level epistemic dynamics with AI intervention?
