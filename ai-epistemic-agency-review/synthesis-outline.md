### SECTION 2: Epistemic Agency and Authority - The Core Conceptual Debate
**Target**: 700-800 words
**BibTeX Sources**: Domain 1 (literature-domain-1.bib), Domain 2 (literature-domain-2.bib)
**Output File**: synthesis-section-2.md

**Key Debates to Cover**:
1. **What constitutes epistemic agency with AI?**
   - Coeckelbergh (2025): AI risks diminishing epistemic agency through influencing belief formation
   - Naeem & Hauser (2024): Counter-view that epistemic integration allows responsible AI-assisted belief
   - Wu et al. (2025): Symbiotic epistemic agency model - both human and AI contributions valued

2. **AI as Epistemic Authority or Tool?**
   - Hauswald (2025): Can AI be recognized as artificial epistemic authority?
   - Koskinen (2023): AI not appropriate candidate for trust (not agents)
   - Sahebi & Formosa (2025): AI-mediated communication threatens epistemic trust

**Central Tension**: Preservation vs transformation of epistemic agency
- Does AI extend our epistemic capacities (tool view)?
- Or does it assume epistemic authority that displaces human reasoning (authority view)?

**Research Gap**: No clear framework for when AI engagement constitutes rational persuasion vs epistemic displacement

**Papers**:
- Coeckelbergh (2025), Hauswald (2025), Naeem & Hauser (2024), Wu et al. (2025)
- Koskinen (2023), Sahebi & Formosa (2025)
- Special issues on epistemic autonomy and authority (Social Epistemology 2024-2025)

### SECTION 3: The Persuasion-Manipulation Distinction and Democratic Implications
**Target**: 700-800 words
**BibTeX Sources**: Domain 6 (literature-domain-6.bib), Domain 4 (literature-domain-4.bib), Domain 1
**Output File**: synthesis-section-3.md

**Core Question**: When does AI-prompted belief revision count as rational persuasion vs manipulation?

**Key Arguments**:
1. **Democratic Epistemic Foundations**
   - Coeckelbergh (2022): AI endangers democracy by diminishing citizens' epistemic agency
   - Coeckelbergh (2025): LLMs create truth-related risks (hallucination, epistemic bubbles, bullshit, epistemic anachronism)
   - Wihbey (2024): AI creates epistemic risk - corporations/governments can monopolize epistemic space

2. **Cognitive Stratification**
   - Wright (2025): AI creates "cognitive castes" - epistemic stratification in democratic societies
   - Algorithmic truth (AI & Society 2025): AI truth embedded with normative assumptions and biases
   - Result: Minority of epistemic agents, majority of passive consumers

3. **Epistemic Injustice Dimensions**
   - Kay et al. (2024): Generative epistemic injustice - amplified/manipulative testimonial injustice
   - Milano & Prunkl (2024): Algorithmic profiling causes "epistemic fragmentation"
   - Power dynamics in AI-mediated belief revision

**Central Distinction**:
- **Rational Persuasion**: AI engages critical faculties, reveals epistemic limitations, preserves agency
- **Manipulation**: AI bypasses critical reasoning, creates epistemic dependence, displaces agency

**Research Gap**: Criteria for distinguishing rational persuasion from manipulation in AI-human interaction remain underdeveloped. Population-level effects (not just individual) underexplored.

**Papers**:
- Coeckelbergh (2022, 2025), Wright (2025), Wihbey (2024)
- Kay et al. (2024), Milano & Prunkl (2024)
- AI & Society (2025) on automating epistemology

### SECTION 4: Cognitive Mechanisms - How AI Engages Human Reasoning
**Target**: 600-700 words
**BibTeX Sources**: Domain 5 (literature-domain-5.bib), Domain 3 (literature-domain-3.bib)
**Output File**: synthesis-section-4.md

**Focus**: Mechanisms underlying AI-facilitated belief revision

**Key Areas**:
1. **Theory of Mind and Social Reasoning**
   - Strachan et al. (2024): LLMs perform at/above human levels on ToM tasks
   - Nature 2025: LLMs use specialized internal connections for social reasoning
   - PNAS (2024): ChatGPT-4 solves 75% of false-belief tasks
   - Philosophical question: Does ToM capability enable persuasion or manipulation?

2. **Metacognition and Epistemic Humility**
   - Philosophy & Technology (2024): ChatGPT can engage epistemic humility and metacognitive capacities
   - Medicine/Philosophy (2025): Epistemic humility in AI-assisted contexts
   - How AI can trigger recognition of epistemic limitations (knowing we know less)

3. **Doxastic Responsibility**
   - Naeem & Hauser (2024): Epistemic integration allows responsible belief formation
   - Frontiers (2025): Community standards for epistemic responsibility in human-AI collaboration
   - Question: Are we responsible for beliefs formed through AI interaction?

**Connecting to Research Question**:
- If LLMs possess/simulate ToM, they can model what we believe and strategically engage our reasoning
- This could be rational persuasion (helping us see flaws in reasoning) OR manipulation (exploiting reasoning patterns)
- Epistemic humility triggered by AI may be genuine insight OR induced passivity

**Research Gap**: Little work on how AI's cognitive capabilities (ToM, etc.) specifically enable population-level belief shifts through rational persuasion

**Papers**:
- Strachan et al. (2024), Niu et al. (2024), Chen et al. (2025) - ToM in LLMs
- Philosophy & Technology (2024), Medicine/Philosophy (2025) - epistemic humility
- Naeem & Hauser (2024), Frontiers (2025) - doxastic responsibility

### SECTION 5: AI in Scientific Practice - A Model for Epistemic Partnerships?
**Target**: 500-600 words
**BibTeX Sources**: Domain 7 (literature-domain-7.bib), Domain 2
**Output File**: synthesis-section-5.md

**Framing**: Scientific practice as test case for AI-human epistemic partnerships

**Key Debates**:
1. **Opacity and Scientific Knowledge**
   - Duede (2023): Deep learning opacity in scientific discovery
   - Zakharova (2025): Can opaque AI (AlphaFold) produce genuine scientific knowledge?
   - Philosophy & Technology (2024): Epistemic cost of opacity - undermines knowledge even when reliable

2. **Trust and Epistemic Dependence**
   - Koskinen (2023): No satisfactory social epistemology of AI-based science (AI not trust candidate)
   - Synthese (2025): Counter-view that opacity poses no novel problems for trust
   - Cruz-Aguilar (2025): AI integration is "profound transformation in epistemic structure of science"

3. **Lessons for Broader Epistemic Agency Questions**
   - If scientists can't trust opaque AI, can citizens?
   - If scientific belief revision through AI is epistemically problematic, what about everyday belief revision?
   - Scientific norms (transparency, contestability) as model for responsible AI epistemology

**Relevance to Research Question**:
- Science provides clearest case of rational persuasion norms
- If AI can engage scientific reasoning rationally despite opacity, suggests potential for broader rational persuasion
- But if opacity undermines scientific knowledge, raises concerns about AI's role in belief revision generally

**Research Gap**: Connection between AI epistemology in science and AI's role in public/democratic epistemology underexplored

**Papers**:
- Duede (2023), Zakharova (2025), Koskinen (2023)
- Philosophy & Technology (2024) - epistemic cost
- Cruz-Aguilar (2025), Synthese (2025)

**Tone**: Forward-looking, identifies clear research space, shows how project addresses multiple literatures

---

## Bibliography
**Format**: Chicago-style author-date citations
**Approach**: Synthesis writers will parse BibTeX files to construct in-text citations and final bibliography
**Estimated Length**: 150-200 words for 40-50 cited papers (selective citation, not all 74 papers)

---

## Section-Writing Strategy

**Phase 5 Process**:
1. Write each section independently (synthesis-section-1.md through synthesis-section-6.md)
2. Each section writer receives:
   - This outline (full context)
   - Section number and word target
   - Relevant BibTeX domain files only
   - Research question and key angle (rational persuasion vs manipulation)
3. After all sections complete, assemble: `cat synthesis-section-*.md > literature-review-final.md`

**Section Dependencies**:
- Sections 1-6 can be written in parallel (independent structure)
- Each builds on previous conceptually but can stand alone
- Final assembly will create coherent narrative flow
