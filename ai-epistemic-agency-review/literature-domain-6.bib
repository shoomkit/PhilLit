@comment{DOMAIN 6: POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF AI AND KNOWLEDGE}
@comment{===================================================================}
@comment{
Domain Focus: This domain examines how AI systems affect public
knowledge, democratic discourse, and collective epistemic agency. Key
themes include: AI's impact on democratic citizenship and political
agency, population-level belief polarization or convergence through AI,
epistemic foundations of democracy, collective epistemic agency in
AI-mediated environments, and AI governance from epistemic perspective.

Search Strategy: PhilPapers (AI + democracy, AI + public knowledge),
Journal of Political Philosophy, Political Theory, Philosophy & Public
Affairs, AI and Ethics, Science and Engineering Ethics, SSRN

Key Questions:
- How do AI systems affect public knowledge and democratic discourse?
- Does AI cause population-level belief polarization or convergence?
- What are epistemic aspects of AI governance?
- How is collective epistemic agency affected by AI-mediated
  environments?
- What epistemic foundations does democracy require?

  note = {Foundational paper arguing that AI endangers democracy since it risks diminishing epistemic agency of citizens and thereby undermining relevant kind of political agency in democracy. Political democratic agency relies on epistemic agency - as citizen in democracy I need control over formation of my political knowledge. Shows epistemic bubbles and defaulting of statistical knowledge endanger epistemic agency when citizens form and revise political beliefs.}

  note = {What humans believe to be true and worthy of attention - what becomes public knowledge - may increasingly be influenced by judgments of advanced AI systems. Using AI as powerful political tool, large corporations and governments can monopolize epistemic space and, therefore, political space. As AI technologies structure creation of public knowledge, substance may be increasingly recursive byproduct of AI itself - 'epistemic anachronism'. Major paper on epistemic risk to democracy.}

  note = {Introduces 'algorithmic truth' to describe epistemic shift as AI increasingly mediates public knowledge and legitimacy. Since algorithmic truth is enacted at scale and with perceived objectivity, it carries technocratic authority that may displace other forms of human reasoning and social negotiation. Transition from classical epistemology to computational epistemology marks profound reordering of knowledge practices. AI verification systems tend to reinforce epistemic centrality bias, equating institutional prominence with reliability. Public epistemology implications.}
