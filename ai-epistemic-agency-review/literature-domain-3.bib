@comment{DOMAIN 3: DOXASTIC RESPONSIBILITY WITH AI}
@comment{===================================================================}
@comment{
Domain Focus: This domain examines epistemic and doxastic responsibility
when beliefs are formed through AI interaction. Key themes include:
rational belief revision prompted by AI, epistemic obligations in
AI-mediated reasoning, whether we're responsible for AI-assisted beliefs,
and epistemic virtues/vices in human-AI cognitive partnerships.

Search Strategy: PhilPapers (doxastic responsibility, epistemic
responsibility + AI), SEP (ethics of belief, doxastic voluntarism),
Philosophical Psychology, American Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophy &
Technology

Key Questions:
- Are we epistemically responsible for beliefs formed through AI?
- How does AI delegation affect epistemic obligations?
- What constitutes rational belief revision when prompted by AI?
- Which epistemic virtues and vices emerge in AI-mediated reasoning?

Note: This domain has less AI-specific literature than others,
reflecting a research gap. Includes foundational work on doxastic
responsibility to establish conceptual framework.
