# Section 2: Housing Burden Distribution - The Income Gradient

The distribution of housing cost burdens across German society reveals a stark income gradient: low-income households face severe burdens while higher-income households maintain moderate costs. This pattern is robust across measurement approaches, data sources, and time periods, providing strong support for Hypothesis 2 (high burdens for low-income urban dwellers) while offering mixed evidence for Hypothesis 1 (flat burdens for median incomes despite rising costs).

## The Income Gradient: Core Finding

Dustmann, Fitzenberger, and Zimmermann's (2022) analysis of German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and Income and Consumption Survey (EVS) data from 1993-2013 establishes the foundational finding: housing expenditure dramatically amplifies income inequality. They show that while the 50/10 income ratio increased by 22 percentage points over two decades, incorporating housing costs increased this gap to 62 percentage points—a three-fold amplification effect. This occurs because the income share devoted to housing rose disproportionately for the bottom income quintile while falling for the top quintile. Approximately 70% of individuals in the lowest income quintile are renters, while only one-third in the top quintile rent, creating differential exposure to rental cost increases (Dustmann et al. 2022).

European comparative data confirm this gradient's generality. The European Parliament (2024) reports that in 2023, EU households with income below 60% of national median spent 38.2% of disposable income on housing on average, while those above this threshold spent only 16.2%—more than a 20-percentage-point difference. The International Monetary Fund (2023) finds that almost half of the poorest households across EU countries are overburdened by housing costs (spending more than 40% of income on housing) irrespective of tenure status. Tenants in the bottom income quintile who rent at market prices spend more than 40% of disposable income on rents across most European countries. The OECD (2022) documents that in 26 countries, there is at least a 10-percentage-point difference between median housing cost burden of tenants in bottom and third income quintiles.

Germany's specific burden levels are notable. Destatis (2024) reports that 12.0% of Germany's population lived in households overburdened by housing costs in 2024, compared to an EU average of 8.2%. This higher-than-average overburden rate persists despite Germany's relatively high median incomes and extensive rental market protections. The gap suggests that structural features of German housing and labor markets create particular vulnerabilities for lower-income households.

Particular demographic groups exhibit especially severe burdens. DIW Berlin and the German Centre of Gerontology (2021) report that in 2016, elderly renter households (reference person 65+) spent an average of 34% of income on housing. Two-thirds of such households experienced high burden (30%+), and 38% faced overburden (40%+). This elderly renter burden represents dramatic increase from 1991, when nearly one in 20 Germans paid 40%+ of income on rent; by 2016, nearly one in six did so. Dewilde and Lancee (2024) analyze 27 European countries from 2010-2018, finding that the position of market renters deteriorated relative to mortgaged homeowners in terms of both housing cost burdens and low incomes, noting that Germany is one of just five countries where fewer than half of low-income private market tenants are overburdened when total housing costs are considered—suggesting German tenant protections provide some (though incomplete) buffer.

## Urban Housing Markets: Rising Costs and Supply Constraints

Urban areas concentrate housing burden problems through sustained rent increases and severe supply shortages. EmpiricaRegio (2024) documents that net rents in major German cities (A-cities: Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Stuttgart) increased 70% between 2011 and 2024—a dramatic 13-year cumulative increase. This translates to low-income households facing 31% rent burden and median-income households facing 24% burden when signing new tenancy agreements in metropolitan areas. Stawarz et al. (2021), analyzing 401 German counties from 2004-2017, find that residential asking rents per square meter increased by approximately 4% per year between 2011-2017, representing a 26% cumulative increase. Rent-to-income ratios increase systematically with municipality size, confirming urban concentration of burden.

Recent market data show some moderation but continued increases. Cushman & Wakefield (2025) reports that Deutsche Bundesbank's apartment rent index showed 3.7% growth in 2024 compared to 5.0% in 2023, with the seven major cities experiencing slowdown from 6.0% to 3.5%. However, this represents slowing growth, not actual declines—rents continue rising from already-elevated levels. Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf showed increasing growth rates at end of 2024, while Berlin and Munich increases decelerated. Owner-occupied housing prices have fallen: Bundesbank (2023) reports declines of 5.8% to 9.9% year-over-year in Q3 2023 according to different indices, reflecting interest rate increases and market corrections. Yet rental market dynamics differ from ownership markets, and renters have not experienced corresponding burden relief.

Supply constraints underpin sustained urban rent growth. Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank (2024) calculates that Germany needs 320,000 new dwellings annually between 2023-2030, with Berlin requiring 23,000 per year and Munich 11,300. Actual housing completions remain well below the federal target of 400,000 units annually. Building permits issued fell by 27%. Production costs for residential buildings increased approximately 40% since 2020, with total costs in large cities exceeding €5,000 per square meter. Munich exhibits the lowest vacancy rate at just 0.2%, reflecting extreme supply-demand imbalance.

Berlin illustrates displacement dynamics in tight urban markets. Berger and Aubry (2024) surveyed 1,200+ Berlin households, finding that more than 15% experienced direct displacement, with rent increases after refurbishment or property sales proving most common triggers. Berlin gains 40,000 inhabitants annually but constructs only 15,000 new dwellings, creating a 25,000-unit annual gap that intensifies competition for existing housing. GlobalProperty (2025) reports Berlin achieved the highest cumulative value increase since 2000 at approximately 160% adjusted for inflation. Urban centers like Berlin and Munich struggle with vacancy rates around 2%, while eastern rural Germany maintains 7.6% vacancy—a stark spatial divide.

## Testing H1: Flat Burdens for Median Incomes?

Hypothesis 1 proposed that median-income households maintain relatively stable housing cost burdens despite rising urban rents through spatial adjustment mechanisms. Evidence is mixed. EmpiricaRegio (2024) finds median-income households pay approximately 24% of net income on rent when signing new tenancy agreements in metropolitan areas—below the 30% burden threshold but rising from earlier periods. Stawarz et al. (2021) document that rent-to-income ratios increase with city size, suggesting median incomes are affected by urban cost dynamics. Stephens, Lux, and Sunega (2015) note that German and Swedish median households pay more than 16% of disposable income on living costs, high by international standards, though this includes both owners and renters and may reflect Germany's high-quality housing stock.

Three adjustment mechanisms may explain why median-income burden appears more stable than low-income burden despite rising urban costs:

**Migration responses**: Stawarz et al. (2021) demonstrate that regions with rising housing costs experience declining inflows and, in larger cities, increasing outflows. Rising housing costs act as barriers to migration into high-opportunity urban areas. This suggests that median-income households facing unaffordable urban rents may leave rather than accept higher burdens, creating spatial selection where only those who can afford urban rents remain.

**Tenure structure**: Germany's housing system creates buffers for some median-income households. Kaas et al. (2021) show that homeownership rates reach 45% overall but only 22% for bottom income quintile households, implying higher rates for middle-income groups. Homeowners face housing costs primarily through mortgages and maintenance rather than market rents, providing partial insulation from rental market dynamics. Voigtländer (2009) explains Germany's distinctive tenure system: extensive social housing sector (though declining), high real estate transfer taxes (5-6%), no mortgage interest deductibility, and large, non-stigmatized rental market. This institutional context shapes who faces direct exposure to rising rents.

**Displacement**: Berger and Aubry (2024) document that 15% of Berlin residents experienced displacement, concentrated among renters and lower-income households. If displacement primarily affects lower-income households unable to sustain rising burdens, median-income households' aggregate burden statistics may appear stable through compositional effects—those who would show high burdens leave the urban sample through displacement or migration.

**Assessment of H1**: Evidence provides partial but qualified support. Median-income households do maintain lower burdens than low-income households (24% vs. 31% in EmpiricaRegio data), and there are hints that spatial adjustment mechanisms operate. However, the stability may be artifact of selection—median incomes maintaining moderate burdens by avoiding or leaving high-cost cities—rather than genuine stability for households remaining in place. No longitudinal study tracks the same median-income households within cities over time to test whether their burdens remain stable or increase. Cross-sectional data showing moderate median burdens are consistent with either true stability or continuous displacement of those experiencing rising burdens. This ambiguity leaves H1 with mixed support.

## Summary: Income Gradient Robust, Urban Pressures Intense

The income gradient in housing burden is quantitatively large and robust across studies: low-income households face burdens 20+ percentage points higher than higher-income households, with roughly half of poorest households overburdened across Europe. Germany's 12% overburden rate exceeds the EU 8.2% average despite relatively high incomes, suggesting structural vulnerabilities. Urban housing costs rose 70% in major cities between 2011-2024, driven by severe supply constraints (need 320,000 units/year, falling short; Munich 0.2% vacancy; Berlin gaining 40,000 residents annually but building only 15,000 units). Median-income households may maintain moderate burdens through spatial adjustment—migration away from expensive cities, displacement of those who can't afford rising costs—rather than true stability in place.

Hypothesis 2 (high burdens for low-income urban dwellers) receives strong empirical support: every study confirms substantial and growing burdens for bottom income quintiles. Hypothesis 1 (flat burdens for median incomes) receives mixed support: median burdens appear more moderate, but this may reflect selection effects rather than stable in-place experiences. The next section examines whether income-side factors—wage stagnation, public sector wages, labor market dualization—explain these burden patterns.
